你刚写下了"仍然不信任人"

而你颠倒着读出了我写的东西

从这个身份到普通人

00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,620
需要一个过程

12
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,174
把你每天的遭遇写在博客上

他选择这样结束自己的生命

28
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,630
让人无法理解
is a mystery

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,910

拿走她车钥匙了吗?
Did you get the car keys off her?

从她包里拿出来了

45
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,380
一建筑工地被发现
on a building site in Greater London.

46
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,460
初步调查的结果为自杀
Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide.

47
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,349
我们可以确认
We can confirm that

48
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:13,220
这起自杀案十分类似于
this apparent suicide closely resembles those of

49

杰弗瑞·帕特森爵士
Sir Jeffrey Patterson

50
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,430
和詹姆士·费力默的状况
and James Phillimore.

51
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,366
因为这点
In the light of this,

52
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,710
我们认为他们很有可能有关联
these incidents are now being treated as linked.

53
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,055
调查还在继续
The investigation is ongoing

54
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,940
不过雷斯垂德探长会回答大家的问题
but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.

55
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,520
探长 自杀事件怎么会有关联?
Detective Inspector, how can suicides be linked?

56
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,140
因为他们服用的药都一样
Well, they all took the same poison.

57
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,918
尸体都在他们不该出现的地方出现
They were all found in places they had no reason to be.

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,166
都没有明显的动机
None of them had shown any prior indication.

59
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,760
不可能会有连环自杀
But you can't have serial suicides.

60
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,310
显然已经有了
Well, apparently you can.

61
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,360
这三人之间没有关系吗?
These three people, there's nothing that links them?

62
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,830
暂时还没发现关系 但是
There's no link we've found yet but

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,420
我们在寻找 一定存在的
we're looking for it. There has to be one.

64
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,255
(错)
Wrong！

65
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,081
如果你们都收到了短信 请忽略它
If you've all got texts, please ignore them.

66
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:56,095
上面只写着"错"
It just says "Wrong".

67
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,770
是的 别管它 如果没有其它问题
Well, just ignore that. If there are no more questions,

68
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,985
要问雷斯垂德探长的话
For Detective Inspector Lestrade

69
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,715
这次发布会就到此结束了
I'm going to bring this session to an end.

70
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,420
既然是自杀 你们在调查什么?
If they're suicides, what are you investigating?

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,560
就像我说的 这几起自杀明显存在联系
As I say, these suicides are clearly linked.

72
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,788
这件事很不寻常
It's an unusual situation,

73
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,140
我们已经派遣最好的人手调查
we've got our best people investigating.

74
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,750
又收到了“错”
Says "Wrong" again.

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,559
最后一个问题
One more question.

76
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,241
有可能是谋杀吗?
Is there any chance that these are murders?

77
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,170
如果是的话 会是连环杀手干的吗?
And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?

78
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,216
我知道你们更喜欢写这种故事
I know that you like writing about these

79
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,380
但现场状况确系自杀
but these do appear to be suicides.

80
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,925
两者的差别明显
We know the difference.

81
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,420
很清楚 毒药是他们自己服下的
The poison was clearly self-administered.

82
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,235
是的 可如果他们真是被杀
Yes, but if they are murders,

83
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:37,950
大家怎么才能保证自身安全?
how do people keep themselves safe?

84
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,028
珍爱生命 不要自杀
Well, don't commit suicide.

85

86
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,455
现在虽是恐慌时期
Obviously, This is a frightening time for people

87
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,690
大家需要的是提高警惕
but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.

88
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,140
安全是可以由自己创造的
We are all as safe as we want to be.

89
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,980

弄的我们像白痴一样
He's making us look like idiots.

94
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,580
你告诉我他是怎么做到的 我就去
If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him.

它对我没用
It wasn't working for me.

Really? It was a big improvement.

155
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,960
你现在嘴太小了
Your mouth's too small now.

156
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,670
好吧
OK.

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,400
你对小提琴感觉如何?
How do you feel about the violin?

158
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,825
对不起 什么?
I'm sorry, what?

159
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,065
我在想事情时会拉小提琴 有时
I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes

160
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,235
一天都不讲话 你介意吗?
I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you?

161
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,870
做室友应该知道对方的缺点
Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.

162
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,340
你把我的事告诉他了
You told him about me?

163
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,495
一个字都没提
Not a word.

164
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,570
那谁告诉你室友这回事?
Who said anything about flatmates?

165
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:42,775
我本人 今早我告诉麦克
I did. Told Mike this morning

166
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,480
我这种人找个室友多困难
that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

167
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,184
刚过午饭 他就来了
Now here he is just after lunch

168
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,600
带来一个老朋友 显然刚在
with an old friend clearly just home from

169
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,828
阿富汗军队服役过 并不难猜到吧
military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap.

170
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,970
你怎么知道阿富汗的事?
How did you know about Afghanistan?

171
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,141
我找到了伦敦市中心的一个好地方
Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.

172
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,035
价格我们一起能负担得起
We ought to be able to afford it.

173
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,900
明晚7点整 在那里碰头
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o'clock.

174
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:00,848
抱歉 我真健忘
Sorry, got to dash.

175
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:02,940
把鞭子留在停尸间了
I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.

176
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,520
这表示?
Is that it?

177
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,170
表示什么?
Is that what?

178
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,862
我们才刚见面
We've only just met

179
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,410
就要一起找房子?
and we're going to go and look at a flat?

180
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,990
有问题吗?
Problem?

181
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,510
我们彼此一无所知
We don't know a thing about each other.

182
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:17,439
不知道约在哪里见
I don't know where we're meeting,

183
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,160
甚至也不知道你的名字
I don't even know your name.

184
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,997
我知道你是军医 刚从阿富汗
I know you're an Army doctor and you've been

185
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,465
被遣送回国
invalided home from Afghanistan.

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,853
你有一个哥哥 很关心你
You've got a brother worried about you

187
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,894
你却不愿意得到他的帮助
but you won't go to him for help because you don't

188
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:28,900
你对他不满 也许因为他嗜酒
approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic,

189
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,360
更有可能是他刚抛弃了他老婆
more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.

190
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:32,743
我也知道医生认为你
And I know that your therapist thinks your

191
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,799
患有伤残心理后遗症 恐怕这诊断很对
limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.

192
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,820
作为室友 这些够了吧?
That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?

193
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,096

欠我一个人情 几年之前

她丈夫在弗罗里达被判处无期徒刑

209
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,196
我出了点力

00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:18,160
所以 你让她丈夫免于死刑?
Sorry - you stopped her husband being executed?

你说可以从领带看出一个软件设计师

238
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,210
从大拇指看出一个飞行员

是的
Yes.

240

我从你的脸和腿上
And I can read your military career

241

看出你军人的经历
in your face and your leg,

242
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,740
从你的手机上看出你兄弟酗酒
and your brother's drinking habits on your mobile phone.

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,060
怎么看?
How?

这些自杀是怎么回事 夏洛克?
What about these suicides then, Sherlock?

245
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,530

要不你也不会专程来
You wouldn't have come to me

254
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,330
肯定有些反常之处
otherwise there was somethin different.

之前受害人从不留信息 这次有了

我给你倒杯茶 歇歇你的腿

Yeah, where are we going?

306
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,670
犯罪现场 下个问题?
Crime scene. Next?

307
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,334
你是谁 你的职业是什么?
Who are you, what do you do?

308
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,595
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

309
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,905
我会猜...私家侦探      可是?
I'd say... private detective. But?

310
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,280
警察不会去找私家侦探
But the police don't go to private detectives.

311
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,385
我是个"咨询侦探" 世界唯一的
I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world,

312
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,125
这工作是我发明的
I invented the job.

313
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,151
那是什么?      每当警察
What does that mean? Means when the police

314
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,100
找不到方向 他们经常都这样
are out of their depth, which is always,

315
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,221
他们会咨询我
they consult me.

316
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,510
警察不会咨询外行的
The police don't consult amateurs.

317
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,955
我昨天遇到你时
When I met you for the first time yesterday,

318
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,240
提到了阿富汗和伊拉克 你看起来很惊讶
I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised.

319
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,527
是的 你怎么知道?
Yes, how DID you know?

320
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:53,780
我不是知道 是观察到的
I didn't know, I saw.

321
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,895
你的发型 举止是军人的风格
'Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military.

322
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,880
而你说的话      物是人非了
'But your conversation... ' Bit different from my day.

323
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:01,649
说明在巴兹医学院学习过
.. said trained at Barts -

324
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,384
所以很明显是军医
so Army doctor, obvious.

325
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,340
你的脸晒的比较黑
'Your face is tanned...

326
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,973
可手腕却没晒黑
'but no tan above the wrists.

327
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,623
所以你曾去过国外 可并不是日光浴
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

328
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:10,238
你的走路时跛的厉害
'Your limp's really bad when you walk,

329
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:11,741
却宁愿站着 不要椅子
but you don't ask for a chair when you stand -

330
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:12,968
完全忘了伤残
that you forgot about it

331
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,945
所以至少有点身心障碍
'so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

332
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,352
也说明因为你的伤口
'That says the original circumstances of the injury

333
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,867
是外伤
were traumatic -'

334
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,829
战场上受伤 战场上受伤
wounded in action then. Wounded in action,

335
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:22,450
苏丹 阿富汗 或者是伊拉克
suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

336
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,895
你说我有个治疗师
You said I had a therapist.

337
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,600
你有伤残心理障碍
You've got a psychosomatic limp,

338
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,235
当然会有治疗师
of course you've got a therapist.

339
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,022
然后是你的哥哥 因为电话
Then there's your brother. Your phone.

340
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,340
它很贵 能发邮件 听音乐
'It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player. '

341
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,857
而你穷到要和人合租
And you're looking for a flatshare.

342
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,696
所以不是你买的 是个礼物
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

343
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,465
划痕 不只一条 很多很多
'Scratches. Not one, many over time -'

344
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,565
一定是和钥匙和硬币放一个口袋
it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins.

345
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,630
你不会对自己的奢侈品这样
You wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this,

346
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,966
所以它之前还有主人
so it's had a previous owner.

347
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,106
下一点就很简单了 你应该知道了
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

348
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,404
刻的字?
The engraving?

349
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,183
哈利·华生
Harry Watson.

350
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,610
明显是你家人送你的电话
Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.

351
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,560
不是你父亲 这东西是年轻人玩的
Not your father, this is a young man's gadget.

352
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,177
有可能是表兄弟 可你是个
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero

353
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,465
无家可归的战斗英雄
who can't find a place to live -

354
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,431
不像是大家族里的人
unlikely you've got an extended family,

355
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,362
所以是近亲 那就是兄弟了
not one you're close to. So brother it is.

356
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,137
然后是克拉若?
Now, Clara, who's Clara?

357
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:02,025
3个吻代表是浪漫的纪念
Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment.

358
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,680
这个价格应该是老婆送的 不是女朋友
The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.

359
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,724
应该是最近给的
Must have given it to him recently,

360
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,315
大概用了6个月
it's only six months old.

361
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,640
婚姻出现问题了 6个月他就送人了
Marriage in trouble then - six months on he's given it away.

362
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,040
如果是她甩他 也许他会留作纪念
If she'd left HIM, he would have kept it. Sentiment.

363
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,255
不 他想扔掉 是他甩她
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

364
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,800
他把手机给你 是希望和你保持联系
He gave the phone to you, so he wants you to stay in touch.

365
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:18,690
你在找便宜的房子
You're looking for cheap accommodation,

366
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,580
却不向你兄弟求助
but you're not going to your brother for help -

367
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:21,699
所以你和他之前有问题
that says you've got problems with him.

368
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,849
也许你喜欢他老婆 也许讨厌他喝酒
Maybe you liked his wife, or don't like his drinking.

369
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:29,080
那你怎么知道他喝酒的事?
How can you possibly know about the drinking?

370
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,765
胡乱猜的 不过挺准
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

371
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,230
电源插口周围有一些磨损
Power connection - tiny little scuff marks round it.

372
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,312
所以他每晚想插进去充电 可手却在发抖
Every night he plugs it in but his hands are shaking.

373
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:37,360
这在清醒人的手机上是不会出现的
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone,

374
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:38,780
每个酗酒的人都有
never see a drunk's without them.

375
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:40,440
好吧 你也说对了
There you go, you were right.

376
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:42,827
我对了 哪里说对了?
I was right? Right about what?

377
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:45,180
警察不会咨询外行
The police don't consult amateurs.

378
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,910
这...太神奇了
That... was amazing.

379
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,330
你这样觉得?       当然了
Do you think so? Of course it was.

380
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,152
了不起 真的很了不起
It was extraordinary, it was quite extraordinary.

381
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,266
别人通常不会这么说
That's not what people normally say.

382
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,100
别人一般怎么说?
What do people normally say?

383
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,530
滚开
Piss off

384
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,680
我有哪里猜错了吗?
Did I get anything wrong?

385
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,620
哈利和我关系不好 从来没好过
Harry and me don't get on, never have,

386
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,990
卡拉若和哈利三个月之前分手
Clara and Harry split up three months ago

387
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,720
他们在闹离婚
and they're getting a divorce,

388
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,712
哈利是酗酒的人
and Harry is a drinker.

389
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,130
那全中 没想到所有都猜中了
Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything.

390
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,300
哈利是哈莉叶的爱称
Harry's short for Harriet.

391
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,070
哈利是你的姐妹
Harry's your sister.

392
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,188
我到底来这儿做什么?
Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?

393
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:34,772
姐妹
Sister

394
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,648
老实讲 我到底来这里做什么?
No - seriously, what am I doing here?

395
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:37,740
总要出点错
There's always something.

396
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,020
你好 怪胎      我找雷斯垂德探长
Hello, freak I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.

397
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:43,100
为什么?
Why?

398
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,055
他请我来的
I was invited.

399
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,681
为什么?      我想他想让我看看
Why? I think he wants me to take a look.

400
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:48,272
好吧 你知道我想什么吗?
Well, you know what I think, don't you?

401
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,660
当然 莎莉
Always Sally.

402
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,840
我知道你昨天连家都没有回
I even know you didn't make it home last night.

403
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,388
我没有...这位是谁?
I don't... Who's this?

404
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:55,755
我的同事 华生医生
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

405
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,440
华生医生 莎莉·多诺万警官
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

406
00:21:58,475 --> 00:21:59,665
老朋友
Old friend.

407
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,160
同事? 你竟然有同事?
A colleague? How do YOU get a colleague?

408
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,550
他会跟踪你到家吗?
Did he follow you home?

409
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:05,899
如果我出去等是不是比较好...
Would it be better if I just waited...

410
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:06,980
别
No.

411
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,870
怪胎来了 我带他进去
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

412
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,695
啊 安德森 又见面了
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

413
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,092
这是犯罪现场 不许污染它
It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated.

414
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,140
明白了吗?
Are we clear on that?

415
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,510
非常明白
Quite clear.

416
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,095
你老婆很久不回家了吗?
And is your wife away for long?

417
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,558
别装做是你推理出来的
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.

418
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:32,431
有人告诉你吧
Somebody told you that.

419
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,220
你的除臭剂告诉我的
Your deodorant told me that.

420
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,500
我的除臭剂?
My deodorant?

421
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,851
是男士用的
It's for men.

422
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:38,906
当然了 我喷的当然是男用的
Well, of course it's for men - I'm wearing it.

423
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,750
和多诺万警官身上的一样
So's Sergeant Donovan.

424
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,150
味道突然消失了 我能进吗?
Ooh... I think it just vaporised. May I go in?

425
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:46,265
听着 不管你在暗示什么...
Ah, look. Whatever you're trying to imply...

426
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,260
我什么都没说 我相信莎莉只是
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round

427
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:52,220
来和你聊聊天 顺便就过夜了
for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.

428
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:54,270
我猜她还帮你擦了地
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,

429
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,430
从她膝盖看出来的
going by the state of her knees.

430
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,260
你得穿一件这个
You'll need to wear one of these.

431
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,740
这是谁?
Who's this?

432
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,170
我的人
He's with me.

433
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,110
可他是谁?      我说他是我的人
But who is he? I said he's with me.

434
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,950
你不穿一件吗?
Aren't you going to put one on?

435
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,880
现场在哪?      楼上
So where are we? Upstairs.

436
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,320
我给你两分钟的时间
I can give you two minutes.

437
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,120
也许需要久一点
May need longer.

438
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,440
信用卡上显示她叫詹妮弗·温森
Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards,

439
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:41,360

440
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:42,840

Some kids found her.

442
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,370
住嘴
Shut up.

443
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,359
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

444
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:22,584

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,380
(干净)
clean

457
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,730
(一面干净一面脏)

458
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,870
(经常脱下)
regularly removed

459
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,000
(多次通奸)

460
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,400
发现什么了吗?
Got anything?

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,145
不太多
Not much.

462
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,290
她是德国人
She's German.

463
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,698
RACHE在德文中是复仇的意思
Rache. It's German for revenge.

464
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,707
她是想告诉我们什么
She could be trying to tell us something...

465
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,370
谢谢您的参与
Yes, thank you for your input.

466
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,469
所以她是德国人?      当然不是
So she's German? Of course she's not.

467
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:49,895
(未来7天天气预报)      她是外地来的
She's from out of town though.

468
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,796
她准备在回卡迪夫前
Intended to stay in London for one night

469
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,000
在伦敦呆一晚上 这很明显
before returning home to Cardiff. So far, so obvious.

470
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:55,857
抱歉 明显?
Sorry - obvious?

471
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,156
那这个信息是什么?
What about the message though?

472
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,420
华生医生 你认为呢?
Dr Watson, what do you think?

473
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,533
信息?
Of the message?

474
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,949
是尸体 你是学医的
Of the body. You're a medical man.

475
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:02,330
我们外面有整队人马
We have a whole team right outside.

476
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:03,080
他们不为我工作
They won't work with me.

477
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:05,070
我排除万难让你来这里
I'm breaking every rule letting YOU in here...

478
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,040
是的...因为你需要我
Yes... because you need me.

479
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,360
是的 我需要
Yes, I do.

480
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,880
上帝保佑
God help me.

481
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,440
华生医生?
Dr Watson Hm?

482
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,680
像他说的那样 请自便
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

483
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,620
安德森 让大家离开几分钟
Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes...

484
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:27,195
好吧?      我来这里做什么?
Well? What am I doing here?

485
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,654
帮我理清头绪      我只想
Helping me make a point. I'm supposed to

486
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,140
分担你的房租      这个有趣多了
be helping you pay the rent. This is more fun.

487
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,580
有趣?一个女人躺在这里 死掉了
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

488
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,570
分析很准确 不过希望你再深入点
Perfectly sound analysis, but I WAS hoping you'd go deeper.

489
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,210
好吧
Yeah...

490
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,336
可能是窒息死亡 晕过去了
Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out,

491
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,565
被自己的呕吐物塞住
choked on her own vomit.

492
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,185
身上没有酒味
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

493
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,285
应该是突然发作 可能是药物
It could have been a seizure. Possibly drugs.

494
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,350
你知道怎么回事 你看了报纸
You know what it was, you've read the papers.

495
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,782
她是自杀者之一 第4个
Well, she's one of the suicides. The fourth...?

496
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,537
夏洛克 你说两分钟 发现了些什么
Sherlock - two minutes, I said, I need anything you got.

497
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,902
受害者年近30 专业人士
Victim is in her late 30s. Professional person,

498
00:27:13,937 --> 00:27:14,909
从她的衣着判断
going by her clothes -

499
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:15,847
我猜是传媒界的人
I'm guessing the media,

500
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,170
穿着显眼的粉色
going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.

501
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,591
她从卡迪夫而来
Travelled from Cardiff today intending

502
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:22,490
准备呆一晚 从箱子大小可以看出
to stay in London one night from the size of her suitcase.

503
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,667
箱子?      箱子 是的
Suitcase? Suitcase, Yes.

504
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,568
她结婚至少10年了 但并不愉快
She's been married at least ten years, but not happily.

505
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,823
她有一连串的情人
She's had a string of lovers

506
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,625
但没人知道她结婚了
but none of them knew she was married.

507
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,498
看在上帝的份上 你是顺口说说的
Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up...

508
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,105
她的婚戒 至少有10年历史了
Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least.

509
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,990
她其它的饰品都很干净
The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned,

510
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:36,965
唯独婚戒不是
but not her wedding ring.

511
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,539
这就是她的婚史
State of her marriage right there

512
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,250
里面比外面亮
The inside is shinier than the outside.

513
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,462
说明经常被摘掉
That means its regularyly removed

514
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:42,890
只有在她摘掉时
The only polishing it gets is

515
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,261
才算被擦拭一次
when she works it off her finger.

516
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,597
不是为工作 看她的指甲
It's not for work, look at her nails.

517
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:46,418
她不用手工作
She doesn't work with her hands

518
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:48,632
那为什么要脱去婚戒?
so who does she remove her rings for?

519
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,777
不只有一个情人  她不能
Not one lover, she'd never sustain

520
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,380
假装单身那么久
the fiction of being single for that long

521
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:55,466
所以更可能有一长串人     厉害
so more likely a string of them. Brilliant.

522
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,595
抱歉      卡迪夫?
Sorry. Cardiff?

523
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,056
很明显 不是吗?
It's obvious, isn't it?

524
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:01,414
对我来说不明显
It's not obvious to me.

525
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,716
上帝啊 你们小脑瓜里到底装了什么
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains,

526
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,987
一定很无聊 看她的外套
it must be so boring. Her coat -

527
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:06,743
有一点潮湿
it's slightly damp,

528
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:08,566
一定是在最近几个小时内遭遇了暴雨
she's been in heavy rain the last few hours -

529
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,448
伦敦这段时间都没下雨
no rain anywhere in London in that time.

530
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,316
大衣领背面也湿了
Under her coat collar is damp too.

531
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,985
她把它翻起来挡雨
She's turned it up against the wind.

532
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,685
她口袋里有雨伞 可却是干的 没用过
She's got an umbrella in her pocket but it's dry and unused.

533
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,270
不只有风 是强风 大到不能打伞
Not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella.

534
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:20,266
从她的箱子里
We know from her suitcase

535
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:21,633
看出她准备过夜
that she was intending to stay overnight

536
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:24,599
但是她的旅程没超过两三个小时
but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours

537
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,267
因为外套还没干
because her coat still hasn't dried.

538
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,865
所以 哪里刚刚有暴雨
So - where has there been heavy rain

539
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,590
有强风 且在两三小时旅程内?
and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?

540
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,965
卡迪夫
Cardiff.

541
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,600
太棒了      你知道你大声说出来了吗?
Fantastic. Do you know you do that out loud?

542
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,200
抱歉 我闭嘴      没..关系
Sorry, I'll shut up. No, it's... fine.

543
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,475
为什么你一直说旅行箱?
Why do you keep saying suitcase?

544
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,850
是的 它在哪儿?
Yes, where is it?

545
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,391
电话里或是记事本上一定有
She must have had a phone or an organiser.

546
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:44,706
找找瑞秋这个人      她写的是瑞秋?
Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel?

547
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,952
不 她用德语留了句愤怒遗言
No, she was leaving an angry note in German -

548
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:49,418
当然她写的是瑞秋 不可能是其他词
of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.

549
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:50,660
问题是 为什么要等到
the question is Why did she wait

550
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,272
临死时来写?
until she was dying to write it?

551
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:53,815
你怎么知道她有箱子?
How do you know she had a suitcase?

552
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,084
她的右后跟和小腿肚有泥浆的痕迹
Tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf

553
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,045
左边却没有
not present on the left.

554
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
从泥点的图案可以看出
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her

555
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:01,320
她右手拉着一个带轮子的箱子
with her right hand, by that splash pattern.

556
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:03,375
以泥点分布来看 是略小的箱子
Smallish case, going by the spread.

557
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,339
这么小的箱子 对穿衣这么讲究的女士来说
Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious -

558
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:06,428
只够呆一晚
could only be an overnight bag

559
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,079
所以我知道她只带一晚
so we know she was staying one night.

560
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,730
它在哪里 你们拿去做了什么?
Where is it, what have you done with it?

561
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,250
这里没箱子
There wasn't a case.

562
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,145
再说一遍
Say that again.

563
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,630
这里没箱子 什么箱子都没有
There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase.

564
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:19,618
箱子  有人找到一个箱子吗
Suitcase Did anyone find a suitcase?

565
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,571
房子里有箱子吗?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

566
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:23,585
先生 这里没有箱子
Sir, there was no case

567
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,045
可他们是自己服毒的 吞了药
But they take the poison themselves, swallow the pills.

568
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,471
这个很明显 你们怎么会找不到
There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them.

569
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,435
好吧 谢谢 那...
Right, thanks. And...?

570
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,845
所有案子都是谋杀 我不知道方法
It's murder, all of them. I don't know how.

571
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,530
他们不是自杀 是连环谋杀
But they're not suicides, they're serial killings.

572
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,654
我们要寻找一个连环杀手
We've got a serial killer.

573
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:37,002
太好了
I love it.

574
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:38,850
总算有所期待了
There's always something to look forward to.

575
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:39,895
你凭什么这样说?
Why are you saying that?

576
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,270
她的箱子 拜托 她的箱子呢?
Her case Come on, where is her case?

577
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:43,433
自己吃掉了吗?
Did she eat it

578
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:46,190
有其他人在现场 带走了她的箱子
Someone else was here, and they took her case.

579
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,286
所以杀手一定是开车到这儿
So the killer must have driven here.

580
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,745
把箱子忘在车里了
Forgot the case was in the car.

581
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,071
她有可能已经订好酒店 放在里面了
She could have checked into a hotel, left it there.

582
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,363
不 没去酒店 看她的头发
No, she's never got to the hotel. look at her hair.

583
00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:56,051
口红和鞋都是一样颜色
She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes.

584
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,578
她不可能离开酒店
She'd never have left any hotel

585
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,071
如果头发还那么...
with her hair still looking...

586
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,615
夏洛克? 怎么了?
Sherlock? What is it, what?

587
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,595
连环杀手总是很难对付
Serial killers, always hard.

588
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,900
必须等着他们自己犯错
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.

589
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:09,835
我们不能干等着!
We can't just wait!

590
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,265
不用再等了 看看她 好好看
Oh, we're done waiting. Look at her, really look!

591
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,625
总部 错误找到了 调查卡迪夫那边
Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff.

592
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,740
去找詹妮弗·威尔森的家人和朋友
.Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were.

593
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:17,625
去找瑞秋
Find Rachel

594
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,050
当然了 好的 但到底是什么错?
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

595
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,080
粉色
Pink!

596
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,580
快干活吧...
Let's get on with it...

597
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,645
他走了
He's gone.

598
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,805
谁? 夏洛克·福尔摩斯?
Who, Sherlock Holmes?

599
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,730
是啊 他就那么走了 他总是这样
Yeah, he just took off. He does that.

600
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,260
他会回来吗?      看来不会了
Is he coming back? Didn't look like it.

601
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,230
好吧
Right.

602
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,440
好吧...
Right...

603
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,870
不好意思 我现在是在哪里?
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

604
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,530
布莱克斯顿
Brixton.

605
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,170
你知道该去哪里打车吗?
Do you know where I could get a cab?

606
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,840
因为...
It's just er...

607
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,660
呃...
well -

608
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,280
我的腿
my leg.

609
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
去主干道打车吧
Try the main road.

610
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,880
谢谢
Thanks.

611
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,850
但你不是他的朋友
But you're not his friend.

612
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
他根本没有朋友
He doesn't HAVE friends.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,365
那你是谁?
So who are you?

614
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,365
我...我谁也不是 我才刚认识他
I'm... I'm nobody. I just met him.

615
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,460
好吧 那我建议你 离他远点
OK, bit of advice then. Stay away from that guy.

616
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:49,440
为什么?
Why?

617
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,080
你知道他为什么来这里吗?
You know why he's here?

618
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,480
没有任何报酬 什么也没有
He's not paid or anything.

619
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,690
他喜欢这种场景 能让他兴奋
He likes it. He gets off on it.

620
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,020
罪案越离奇 他就越兴奋 你知道吗?
The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what?

621
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,435
总有一天探案会无法满足他
One day just showing up won't be enough.

622
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,205
总有一天我们会围着一具尸体
One day we'll be standing round a body

623
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,100
夏洛克·福尔摩斯就是始作俑者
and Sherlock Holmes will be the one that put it there.

624
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:12,325
为什么要那么做?
Why would he do that?

625
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,210
因为他精神变态
Because he's a psychopath.

626
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,605
精神变态很容易无聊
Psychopaths get bored.

627
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,620
多诺万      来了
Donovan! Coming.

628
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,950
离夏洛克·福尔摩斯远一点
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

629
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,340
出租车 出租车...
Taxi! Taxi...

630
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,970
喂?
Hello?

631
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,780
你左边的大楼上有架监控摄像头
There is a security camera on the building to your left.

632
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,340
看到了吗?
Do you see it?'

633
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,780
你是哪位?
Who's this?

634
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,425
哪位?
Who's speaking?

635
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,040
看到摄像头了吗 华生医生?
Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?

636
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,140
是的 我看到了       看着...
Yeah, I see it. Watch...

637
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,440
街对面的大楼上有另一个摄像头 看到了吗?
There's another camera on the building opposite you. Do u see it?

638
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,670
最后一个 你右手边大楼的顶层
And finally, at the top of the building on your right.

639
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,205
你是怎么做到的?
How are you doing this?

640
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,255
上车 华生医生
'Get into the car, Dr Watson.

641
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,350
我本可以威胁你
'I would make some sort of threat,

642
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,710
但你一定很清楚自己的处境
but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you. '

643
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,610
你好       嗨
Hello. Hi.

644
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,820
你叫什么名字?
What's your name, then?

645
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:55,470
呃...安西娅
Er... Anthea.

646
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,930
是你的真名吗?      不是
Is that your real name? No.

647
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,415
我叫约翰
I'm John.

648
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,900
我知道
Yes. I know.

649
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,250
我有必要问问这是去哪吗?
Any point in asking... where I'm going?

650
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,870
毫无必要
None at all...

651
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,640
约翰
John.

652
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,010
好吧
OK.

653
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,190
坐下吧 约翰
Have a seat, John.

654
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,620
你知道 我有手机的
You know, I've got a phone.

655
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,990
摄像头那招是很妙
I mean, very clever and all that,

656
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,325
但是...
but er...

657
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,600
打电话给我就行
you could just phone me.

658
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,170
到我手机上
On my phone.

659
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,850
要想避开夏洛克·福尔摩斯的眼睛
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes,

660
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:06,320
就该学会谨慎 所以在此见面
one learns to be discreet, hence this place.

661
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:09,540
你的腿一定很疼 坐下吧
Your leg must be hurting you. Sit down.

662
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:11,010
我不想坐下
I don't want to sit down.

663
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,445
你不怎么害怕啊
You don't seem very afraid.

664
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,820
你也不怎么吓人
You don't seem very frightening.

665
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,265
没错...
Yes...

666
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,930
军人的勇敢
The bravery of the soldier.

667
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,230
勇敢是愚蠢最好听的代言词 你说呢?
Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't u think?

668
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:28,190
你和夏洛克·福尔摩斯什么关系?
What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?

669
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,100
没关系 我们几乎不认识 我昨天才遇到他
I don't have one. I barely know him, I met him... yesterday.

670
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:36,070
才一天工夫 你们就同居了
Mmm, and since yesterday you've moved in with him

671
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,385
现在还一起查案
and now you're solving crimes together.

672
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,540
这周末是不是就该好事将近了?
Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?

673
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,280
你是谁?      利益相关者
Who are you? An interested party.

674
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,282
对夏洛克? 为什么?
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

675
00:36:46,317 --> 00:36:48,215
我猜你们不是朋友
I'm guessing you're not friends.

676
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,060
你也见过他 你想他能有几个朋友?
You've met him. How many friends do you imagine he has?

677
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,645
我是夏洛克能拥有的
I'm the closest thing to a friend

678
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,150
最近乎朋友的存在      你指什么?
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having And what's that?

679
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:59,012
敌人      敌人?
An enemy. An enemy?

680
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,805
在他看来 我绝对是敌人
In HIS mind, certainly.

681
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,120
如果你问他 他会说我是他的魔王
If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

682
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,910
他喜欢把事情搞得戏剧化
He does love to be dramatic.

683
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,440
哟 谢天谢地你没这毛病
Well, thank God YOU'RE above all that.

684
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,120
(若方便速来贝克街-夏·福)      我没打扰你吧
I hope I'm not distracting you.

685
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,605
一点也没打扰
Not distracting me at all.

686
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,590
你打算继续和夏洛克·福尔摩斯合作下去?
Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?

687
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,815
也许说的不对...
I could be wrong...

688
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,385
但我觉得这不关你事
but I think that's none of your business.

689
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,920
很难说      真不关你事
It could be. It really couldn't.

690
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,060
如果你真的搬进...
If you DO move into, erm...

691
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,925
贝克街 221B号
.. 221B Baker Street,

692
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,965
我将非常乐意行方便
I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum

693
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,560
定期付你可观报酬
of money on a regular basis to ease your way.

694
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:46,725
为什么?
Why?

695
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,880
因为你不富有
Because you're not a wealthy man.

696
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:49,880
交换条件是?
In exchange for what?

697
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,155
提供信息
Information.

698
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,000
绝不会侵犯隐私 绝不会让你为难
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel... uncomfortable with.

699
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:58,760
只需告诉我他在干什么      为什么?
Just tell me what he's up to. Why?

700
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,280
我常常为他担心
I worry about him. Constantly.

701
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,915
你可真好人
That's nice of you.

702
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,850
但出于种种原因
But I would prefer for various reasons

703
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,055
希望你对此事守口如瓶
that my concern go unmentioned,

704
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,060
我们的关系有点...不太融洽
we have what you might call a... difficult relationship.

705
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,830
(若不方便亦来 - 夏·福)
If inconvenient, come anyway

706
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,190
不行      我还没说具体金额呢
No. But I haven't mentioned a figure.

707
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:23,070
省省吧
Don't bother.

708
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,855
这么快就对他死心塌地了
You're very loyal VERY quickly.

709
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,770
不 不是 我只是不感兴趣
No, I'm not, I'm just not interested.

710
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,060
"不信任人" 医生写的
"Trust issues"... it says here.

711
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,615
那是什么?
What's that?

712
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,450
你居然不信任其他人
Could it be that you've decided to

713
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:44,250
却信任夏洛克·福尔摩斯?
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

714
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:45,265
谁说我信任他了?
Who says I trust him?

715
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,280
你不像那种轻易交心的人
You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.

716
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:48,730
说完了没?
Are we done?

717
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,800
你说呢
You tell me.

718
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,665
我猜已经有人警告过你离他远点
I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him,

719
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,890
但我看你左手 你不会这么做
but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen.

720
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,880
我的什么?      给我看看
My what? Show me.

721
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,440
别碰
Don't...

722
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,225
了不得      什么?
Remarkable. What is?

723
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,825
这城市大多人都庸庸碌碌
Most people... blunder round this city,

724
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,930
眼中只有繁华街肆 车来人往
and all they see are streets and shops and cars.

725
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,670
与夏洛克·福尔摩斯同行 你却能看到战场
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield.

726
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:44,570
你已经经历过 不是吗?
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

727
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:46,070
我的手怎么了?
What's wrong with my hand?

728
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,195
你的左手会间歇性震颤
You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.

729
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,365
你的医生认为这是创伤后应激障碍
Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

730
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,260
她觉得你被战争的记忆困扰
She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service.

731
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:57,750
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

732
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,515
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

733
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,565
炒了她吧 她的方向完全错误
Fire her. She's got it the wrong way round.

734
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,400
你现在正承受压力 但手却稳如磐石
You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady.

735
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,760
你不是被战争困扰 华生医生...
You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson...

736
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,660
你想念战争
You miss it.

737
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,730
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

738
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,620
该选阵营了 华生医生
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

739
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,730
我带你回家
I'm to take you home.

740
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,310
(可能很危险 - 夏·福)
Dangerous - S H

741
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,025
地址?
Address?

742
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,510
贝克街
Er, Baker Street.

743
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,090
贝克街221B号
221B Baker Street.

744
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,090
但我要先去个地方
But I need to stop off somewhere first.

745
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,785
听着 你老板
Listen, your boss.

746
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,270
能别告诉他我来过这儿吗?
Any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?

747
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,640
当然      你已经告诉他了吧?
Sure. You've told him already, haven't you?

748
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:33,780
没错
Yeah.

749
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,350
呃...你平时有空闲吗?
Hey erm... do you ever get any free time?

750
00:41:42,385 --> 00:41:44,260
当然 多的是
Oh, yeah. Lots.

751
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,380
再见      好吧
Bye OK.

752
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,850
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

753
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,200
尼古丁贴片(戒烟用)
Nicotine patch.

754
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,260
能帮助我思考
Helps me think.

755
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,030
如今在伦敦当老烟枪很难
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.

756
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,965
不利大脑运作
Bad news for brain work.

757
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,045
却有利于呼吸
It's good news for breathing.

758
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,840
呼吸 呼吸乏味透顶
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

759
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,062
你一下就三张贴片?
Is that... three patches?

760
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:38,250
这是三张级的难题
It's a three-patch problem.

761
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,060
怎么样?
Well...?

762
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,220
你让我快来 我以为很重要
You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important.

763
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,730
哦 当然了 我能借用你的手机吗?
Oh - yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?

764
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,005
我的手机?      不用我自己的
My phone? Don't use mine.

765
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,410
号码很可能被认出来
Always a chance that my number will be recognised.

766
00:42:55,445 --> 00:42:56,375
我网站上就有
It's on the website.

767
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,370
赫德森太太有手机      她在楼下呢
Mrs Hudson's got a phone. Yeah, she's downstairs.

768
00:42:58,405 --> 00:42:59,720
我试过大喊 但她耳背
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.

769
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,800
我在伦敦城的另一边...
I WAS the other side of London...

770
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:02,310
不是急事
There was no hurry.

771
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,690
给你...
Here...

772
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,345
要干什么? 这案子?
So what's this about - the case?

773
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,305
她的箱子...      她的箱子?
Her case... HER case?

774
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,340
她的行李箱 当然了
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

775
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,860
凶手拿走了她的行李箱 第一个大错误
The murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake.

776
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:23,870
好吧 他拿走了她的箱子 那又怎样?
OK, he took her case. So?

777
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,050
没用的 别无他法 只能冒险
It's no use, there's no other way. We'll have to risk it.

778
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,950
我桌上有个号码 你帮我发条短信
On my desk there's a number. I want you to send a text.

779
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,120
你叫我来就是为了...发条短信
You've brought me here... to send a text.

780
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,420
没错 发短信 号码在我桌上
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

781
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,830
出什么事了?      刚遇到了你一个朋友
What's wrong? Just met a friend of yours.

782
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,900
朋友?      敌人
A friend? An enemy.

783
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:55,640
哦 哪一个?
Oh. Which one?

784
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,280
据他说 是你的魔王 人真会有魔王?
Well, your arch-enemy, according to him. Do people have arch-enemies?

785
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,610
他有没出钱让你监视我?
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

786
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,440
没错      你收了吗?
Yes. Did you take it?

787
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:08,065
没有
No.

788
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,040
真遗憾 我们本可以平分 下次想清楚点
Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time.

789
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,070
他是谁?      你见过的最危险的人
Who is he? The most dangerous man you've ever met,

790
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:15,280
不过现在的问题不是他
and not my problem right now.

791
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:17,430
发短信 号码在我桌上
On my desk, the number!

792
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,085
詹妮弗·威尔森 这是...
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

793
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,045
等等 这不是受害人吗?
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

794
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,280
是的 这不重要 输入号码吧
Yes. That's not important. Just enter the number.

795
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,030
你在输号码吗?      是的
Are you doing it? Yes.

796
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:34,172
输完了吗?
Have you done it?

797
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:35,280
是...等一下
Yeah - hang on!

798
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,805
照我说的 一字不差
These words exactly.

799
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,040
"劳里斯顿花园发生了什么?"
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

800
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:44,647
"我一定是昏过去了"
I must have blacked out.

801
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,185
"诺森伯兰街22号"
22 Northumberland Street,

802
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,970
"请速前来"      你昏过去了?
please come. " You blacked out?

803
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:51,080
什么? 不是 当然不是
What? No... No!

804
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,530
打好发出去 快点
Type and send it. Quickly.

805
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,340
发出去了吗?       地址是什么?
Have you sent it? What's the address?

806
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,237
诺森伯兰街22号 快
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

807
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:04,726
(劳里斯顿花园发生了什么? 我一定是昏过去了)
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?"

808
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:06,180
(诺森伯兰街22号 请速前来)
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

809
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,040
那是...
That's...

810
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,910
那粉红女郎的箱子 詹妮弗·威尔森的箱子
That's the pink lady's case, that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

811
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:17,450
没错 显然的
Yes, obviously.

812
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,820
或许该解释下 我没杀她
Oh, perhaps I should mention - I didn't kill her.

813
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:23,865
我没说你杀了她      为什么不?
I never said you did. Why not?

814
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,350
我发了那条短信 又有她的箱子
Given that text and the fact I have her case

815
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:28,075
这么想完全符合逻辑
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

816
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,840
别人常以为你是凶手?
Do people usually assume you're the murderer?

817
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,900
没错 时不时会
Now and then, yes.

818
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,230
好吧...
OK...

819
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,600
这个你怎么到手的?      找来的
How did you get this? By looking.

820
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:40,395
哪里?
Where?

821
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,745
凶手一定载她去了劳里斯顿花园
The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

822
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,250
箱子遗落在车里 所以到了他手上
He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car.

823
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,720
谁拿这箱子都会引人注目
Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention -

824
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:51,160
尤其是男人 按统计学凶手大概是男人
particularly a man, which is statistically more likely.

825
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:53,085
所以他迫切想扔掉它
So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it.

826
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,540
一发现自己带着这箱子
the next thing he knows-he still has it. Wouldn't have taken

827
00:45:54,575 --> 00:45:56,922
不到五分钟就意识到是个错误
him more than five minutes to realise his mistake.

828
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,235
我检查了劳里斯顿花园周边
I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car

829
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,040
五分钟车程内每条丢弃大件物品
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens, and anywhere you could

830
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:04,230
不引人注意的小巷
'dispose of a bulky object without being observed.

831
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,480
不到一小时就找到了
'Took me less than an hour to find the right skip. '

832
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,680
粉色 仅靠箱子是粉色 就推理出那么多?
Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?

833
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:14,747
一定是粉色的 显而易见
It had to be pink, obviously.

834
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:15,961
为什么我没猜到?
Why didn't I think of that?

835
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:17,105
因为你是个傻瓜
Because you're an idiot.

836
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,670
不 别那副表情 几乎所有人都是
No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is.

837
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,420
听着 你发现少了什么没?
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

838
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,540
箱子里? 我怎么知道?
From the case? How could I?

839
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,815
她的手机 她的手机呢?
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

840
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,540
尸体和箱子都没手机
There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case.

841
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:30,860
她是有手机的 刚还发了短信
We know she had one. You just texted it.

842
00:46:30,895 --> 00:46:32,525
也许忘在家里了
Maybe she left it at home.

843
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,530
她有一大票情人 必须非常谨慎
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it.

844
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:36,470
她从不把手机放在家里
She never leaves her phone at home.

845
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,290
我为什么要发那条短信?
Why did I just send that text?

846
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,630
问题是 她的手机现在在哪?
Well, the question is where is her phone NOW?

847
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:48,080
可能丢了      没错 或是?
She could have lost it. Yes, or?

848
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,800
凶手...你觉得凶手拿走了手机?
The murderer... You think the murderer has the phone?

849
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:55,802
也许她放箱子时 落了手机
Maybe she... left it when she left her case.

850
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:58,735
也许凶手出于某种原因把手机拿走了
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

851
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,940
无论怎样 手机很有可能在凶手手里
Either way, the balance of probability is murderer has her phone.

852
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:03,965
不好意思...我们在干什么?
Sorry... what are we doing -

853
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,260
我刚给凶手发了短信? 那有什么用?
did I just text a murderer? What good will that do?

854
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,675
刚杀人几小时后
A few hours after his last victim,

855
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,480
凶手收到只可能来自死者的短信
and now he receives a text that can only be from her.

856
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,545
偶然捡到手机的人
If somebody had just found that phone

857
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,950
不会理睬这种短信 但是凶手...
they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer...

858
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,430
会惊慌失措的
would panic.

859
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,245
你和警察说了没?
Have you talked to the police?

860
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,420
死了4个人 没那时间
Four people are dead, there isn't time.

861
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:31,117
那为什么和我说?
So why are you talking to ME?

862
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,780
赫德森太太没收了我那头盖骨
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

863
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,200
所以我在代替你那头盖骨?
So I'm basically filling in for your skull?

864
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:38,017
别紧张 你干的不错
Relax, you're doing fine.

865
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:39,765
好了      什么好了?
Well? Well, what?

866
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,630
你大可坐在这里看电视
Well - you could just sit there and... watch telly.

867
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:43,615
你要我一块去?
What, you want me to come with you?

868
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,060
我喜欢出门有人陪 大声讲话有助于思维
I like company when I go out, I think better when I talk aloud.

869
00:47:47,095 --> 00:47:49,650
头盖骨出门太招摇了 所以...
The skull just attracts attention, so...

870
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,760
有问题吗?      是的 多诺万警官
Problem? Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

871
00:47:52,795 --> 00:47:54,112
她怎么了?
What about her?

872
00:47:54,147 --> 00:47:55,395
她说...
She said...

873
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,570
凶案让你兴奋 乐在其中
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

874
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,130
我说了"危险" 你转眼就来了
And I said "dangerous", and here you are.

875
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,330
该死
Damn it!

876
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,005
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

877
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,090
诺森伯兰街 五分钟走到
Northumberland Street's a five-minute walk from here.

878
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,730
凶手会笨到真去那儿?
You think he's stupid enough to go there?

879
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,655
不 我觉得他聪明极了
No, I think he's brilliant enough.

880
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,930
聪明人我喜欢 都巴不得被抓到
I love the brilliant ones. They're all so desperate to get caught.

881
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,750
为什么?      被人赏识
Why? Appreciation!

882
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,590
受人追捧 终成焦点所在
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

883
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,280
这就是天才的软肋
That's the frailty of genius,

884
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:33,820
他们需要观众
it needs an audience.

885
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:34,660
没错
Yeah.

886
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,540
这就是他的狩猎场 城市的中心
This is his hunting ground. Right here in the heart of the city.

887
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:40,190
现在知道受害人是被他诱拐的
Now that we know his victims were abducted,

888
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,850
那就不一样了
that changes everything.

889
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,920
受害人都是从繁忙的街道消失
Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets,

890
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,700
闹市 但从没人注意到他们离开
crowded places, but nobody saw them go.

891
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,400
想啊 谁虽然素不相识仍让我们信任?
Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them?

892
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:54,730
谁不管到哪里都无人注意?
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

893
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,230
谁在人群中狩猎?
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

894
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,580
我不知道 谁?
Don't know. Who?

895
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,340
一点都没想到 你饿吗?
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

896
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,360
谢谢你 比利
Thank you, Billy.

897
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,325
诺森伯兰郡街22号
22 Northumberland Street.

898
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,000
盯着它
Keep your eyes on it.

899
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,140

你后来还是去坐牢了
You did go to prison.

915

I'm not his date!

917

923
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,520
那么我遇到的是谁?
So who did I meet?

924
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,790
那么正常人在"现实生活"中应该有什么?
What do real people have, then, in their... "real lives"?

你不能私闯我家
You can't just break into my flat.

你不能扣押证物 而且我没私闯

1025
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,725
也别想找到任何消遣的东西
you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational.

1026
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,490
约翰 建议你现在闭嘴吧      拜托
John, you probably want to shut up now. But come on...

1027
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,060
不       什么?
No... What?

不过都很热心
but they're very keen.

1034

这是人类眼球吧      放回去

What - so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

1043
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,480
真找到毒品就不算假装了
It stops being pretend if we find anything.

1044

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,680
找到瑞秋了      她是谁?
We've found Rachel. Who is she?

1050
00:57:40,715 --> 00:57:42,400
詹妮弗·温森的独女
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

1051
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:43,640
她女儿?
Her daughter?

1052
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,500
她为什么写她女儿的名字 为什么?
Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?

1053
00:57:46,535 --> 00:57:48,565
别管了 箱子找到了
Never mind that, we found the case.

1054
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,065
某人曾断言箱子在凶手那里
According to SOMEONE the murderer has the case,

1055
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,990
现在它在我们亲爱的精神病人手里
and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.

1056
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:56,510
我不是精神病 是高功能反社会病
not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

1057
00:57:56,545 --> 00:57:57,555
拜托你专业点
Do your research.

1058
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,570
你得把瑞秋找来 审问她 我也得问她
You need to bring Rachel in and I need to question her.

1059
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:02,027
她死了      太好了 时间地点原因?
She's dead. Excellent. How, when and why?

1060
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,415
有联系吗? 肯定有
Is there a connection? There has to be.

1061
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,990
我可不敢说 她死了14年了
Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 14 years.

1062
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,950
严格说从未活过
Technically she was never alive.

1063
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,870
瑞秋是詹妮弗·温森14年前流产的女儿
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

1064
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:14,300
不 这...
No, that's...

1065
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,770
这不对头 怎么会...
.. that's not right. How...

1066
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,225
她干吗这么做 为什么?
Why would she do that? Why?

1067
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,580
她临死前为啥想女儿?
Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?

1068
00:58:21,615 --> 00:58:23,472
嗯 果然正宗反社会病
Yup - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

1069
00:58:23,507 --> 00:58:25,295
她不是想女儿
She didn't think about her daughter.

1070
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,530
是用指甲把名字刻在地上
She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails.

1071
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:29,395
她快死了
She was dying.

1072
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,320
这很费劲 很痛苦的
It took effort, it would have hurt.

1073
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,360
你说受害人都是自己服药的
You said that the victims all took the poison themselves,

1074
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:36,425
是他逼他们的
that he MAKES them take it -

1075
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,930
呃 也许他... 跟他们说了什么
well, maybe he... I don't know, talks to them.

1076
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:41,365
也许利用了她女儿的死
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.

1077
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,440
对 可那都多少年了 她还郁闷个头啊
Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?

1078
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,420
不对?
Not good?

1079
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,205
是不太对
Bit not good, yeah.

1080
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,540
如果你要死了 被谋杀了
If you were dying... If you'd been murdered -

1081
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,840
你临终会说什么?
in your very last few seconds what would you say?

1082
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,170
"神啊 救救我吧"
"Please, God, let me live. "

1083
00:58:57,205 --> 00:58:58,630
发挥点想象力
Use your imagination!

1084
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,210
我不用
I don't have to.

1085
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,825
对 可假设你聪明
Yeah, but if you were clever...

1086
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,360
詹妮弗这么多情人 她绝对聪明
Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers - she WAS clever.

1087
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,005
她在向我们传达什么
She's trying to tell us something.

1088
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,230
门铃坏了吗? 你叫的车来了 夏洛克
Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

1089
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:11,195
我没叫出租车 走开
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.

1090
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,090
哎哟 翻的这么乱 要找什么啊
Oh, dear. They're making such a mess. What are they looking for?

1091
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:16,110
这是缉毒 赫德森太太
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

1092
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,130
可这是我治腰疼的 是草药...
But they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers...

1093
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:22,140
全都闭嘴 别乱动 别说话 别呼吸
Shut up, everybody! Don't move. Don't speak, don't breathe.

1094
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:22,685
我在思考呢
I'm trying to think.

1095
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,570
安德森 转过去 你太扎眼了
Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off.

1096
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:26,065
什么 我的脸?
What? My FACE is

1097
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,165
都给我安静不许动
Everybody quiet and still.

1098
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,450
安德森 转过去      老天爷
Anderson, turn your back. Oh, for God's sake!

1099
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:30,965
马上转过去 谢谢
Your back, now, please!

1100
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,590
加油 快想啊      车怎么办?
Come on, think. Quick! What about your taxi?

1101
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:34,870
赫德森太太
MRS HUDSON!

1102
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,500
她很聪明 聪明 对
She was clever. Clever, yes!

1103
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,900
她比你们都聪明 她还死了
She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead.

1104
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,065
明白了吗?
Do you see, do you get it?

1105
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,010
手机不是丢了 根本没丢
She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it.

1106
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,745
她栽给凶手了
She PLANTED it on him.

1107
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,165
她下车的时候
When she got out of the car,

1108
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,585
就预料到要死了
she knew that she was going to her death.

1109
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,160
她留下了手机 追踪凶手
She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.

1110
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,200
怎么追踪?
But how?

1111
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:02,130
什么叫怎么追踪?
What do you mean, how?

1112
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,260
瑞秋
Rachel!

1113
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,720
还不懂? 瑞秋
Don't you see? Rachel!

1114
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,145
瞧瞧你们 一群草包
Look at you lot. You're all so vacant.

1115
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,470
不是我的感觉很好吧? 多轻松啊
Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing.

1116
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:16,650
瑞秋不是人名
Rachel is not a name.

1117
01:00:16,685 --> 01:00:18,175
那是什么?
Then what is it?

1118
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,510
约翰 行李上有个标签
John - on the luggage, there's a label.

1119
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:20,790
电子邮件
E- mail address.

1120
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,900
jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk
Er, jennie. pink@mephone. org. uk.

1121
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,185
她没带电脑
She didn't have a laptop,

1122
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,150
所以肯定用手机办公
which means she did her business on her phone.

1123
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:32,125
智能机 绑定邮箱的
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

1124
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,925
有个网站能登陆她的账号
So there was a website for her account.

1125
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,625
用户名就是电邮地址
The username is her e-mail address -

1126
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,290
猜猜看 密码呢?
and all together, the password is?

1127
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:38,500
瑞秋
Rachel.

1128
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,120
我们能看她邮件 所以呢?
So we can read her e-mails. So what?

1129
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:41,425
安德森 别嚷
Anderson, don't talk out loud.

1130
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,915
整条街智商都被你拉低了
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

1131
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,750
何止是邮件 这是智能手机 有卫星定位
We can do much more than that. It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

1132
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:49,062
就是说如果遗失 可以上网追踪
Which means if you lose it you can locate it online.

1133
01:00:49,097 --> 01:00:51,143
她要把我们带到凶手面前
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.

1134
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:53,190
除非他扔了      我们知道他没有
Unless he got rid of it. We know he didn't.

1135
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,905
加油 快啊
Come on, come on. Quickly!

1136
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,255
夏洛克亲爱的 那个出租车司机...
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

1137
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,000
赫德森太太 你晚上该用药了吧
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?

1138
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,035
调车 调直升机
Get vehicles, get a helicopter.

1139
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,685
手机电池是有限的
This phone battery won't last for ever.

1140
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,830
只有地图 没有凶手名字
We'll just have a map reference, not a name.

1141
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:07,425
这是突破口
It's a start!

1142
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,785
夏洛克      至少不是全城都有嫌疑了
Sherlock... Narrows it down from just anyone in London.

1143
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,130
这是我们第一条靠谱线索      夏洛克
It's the first proper lead that we've had. Sherlock...

1144
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:13,760
在哪 快说 在哪?
Where is it? Quickly, where?

1145
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,240
在这里 贝克街221号
Here. It's... in 221 Baker Street.

1146
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,110
怎么会在这里?
How can it be here?

1147
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,880
怎么会?
How?

1148
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,460
也许在你带回的箱子里...
Maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it...

1149
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:27,335
掉出来了
fell out somewhere.

1150
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,790
我还没发现? 我——没发现?
What, and I didn't notice it? Me - I didn't notice?

1151
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:31,880
反正 我们的短信他回了
Anyway, we texted him and he called back.

1152
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:35,170
注意了 在这幢楼里找一个手机
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here,

1153
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:35,915
受害人的...
belonged to the victim...

1154
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,780
谁虽然素不相识仍让我们信任?
'Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?

1155
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,830
(伦敦出租车司机71126)
LONDON CAB DRIVER 71126

1156
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,020
谁不管到哪里都无人注意?
'Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

1157
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,060
谁在人群中狩猎?
'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'

1158
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,060
(跟我来)
COME WITH ME

1159
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,110
夏洛克 你没事吧      什么...
Sherlock, you OK? What...?

1160
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,030
对 对 我没事
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

1161
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,090
那手机为什么在这?
So, how can the phone be here?

1162
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,120
不知道
Don't know.

1163
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,440
我再试试      好主意
I'll try it again. Good idea.

1164
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,810
你去哪?
Where are you going?

1165
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,220
出去透气 就去一会 马上回来
Fresh air, just popping outside for a moment. Won't be long.

1166
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,850
你真的没事?       我很好
You sure you're all right? I'm fine.

1167
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,010
夏洛克·福尔摩斯的车
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

1168
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,200
我没叫出租车
I didn't order a taxi.

1169
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,220
但你未必不需要
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

1170
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,860
你是那个出租司机
You're the cabbie.

1171
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,330
停在诺森伯兰街外的
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.

1172
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,480
那是你 不是乘客
It was you. Not your passenger.

1173
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,770
你瞧 没人会想到出租司机
See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

1174
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,040
就像是透明人
It's like you're invisible.

1175
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,190
永远被人抛到脑后
Just the back of an 'ead.

1176
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,870
对连环杀手 真是得天独厚
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

1177
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,520
你认罪了?       哦 当然
Is this a confession? Oh, yeah.

1178
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,375
再告诉你件事
I'll tell you what else...

1179
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,970
要是你现在叫警察 我不逃跑
If you call the coppers now, I won't run.

1180
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,540
我乖乖坐着 束手就擒 我保证
I'll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise.

1181
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,310
为什么?
Why?

1182
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,590
因为你不会的      我不会吗?
Cos you're not going to do that. Am I not?

1183
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,100
我没杀那四个人 福尔摩斯先生
I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes.

1184
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,200
我跟他们聊天
I spoke to 'em...

1185
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,820
他们就自行了断了
and they killed themselves.

1186
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,660
如果你现在叫警察 我保证一件事
If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing.

1187
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,370
我永远不告诉你我说了什么
I will never tell you what I said.

1188
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,075
不过再也没人会死了
No-one else will die, though,

1189
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:23,240
我相信他们也能结案了
and I believe they call that a result.

1190
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,050
你也永远不知道他们怎么死的了
And you won't ever understand how those people died.

1191
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,380
你想要哪种结案?
What kind of result do you care about?

1192
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,180
如果我想要真相
If I wanted to understand...

1193
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,120
我该怎么做?       我请你兜个风
.. what would I do? Let me take you for a ride.

1194
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,475
好把我也杀掉?
So you can kill me too?

1195
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,930
我没想杀你 福尔摩斯先生
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

1196
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,100
我只想跟你聊聊
I'm going to talk to ya...

1197
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,710
你就自行了断了
.. and then you're going to kill yourself.

1198
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,430
他上出租车了 是夏洛克 他坐车走了
He just got in a cab... It's Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

1199
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:26,032
我说吧 他就是这种人
I told you, he does that.

1200
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:27,600
又被他跑掉了
He bloody left again.

1201
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,625
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting our time!

1202
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,070
我打手机试试 开了响铃
I'm... calling the phone, it's ringing out.

1203
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,540
如果开了响铃 那它不在这儿
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

1204
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,455
我再定位试试
I'll try the search again.

1205
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,950
有关系吗 有意思吗
Does it matter? Does any of it?

1206
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,770
他是个疯子 总会让你失望
He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down.

1207
01:05:51,805 --> 01:05:54,870
你在浪费时间 大家的时间
And you're wasting your time. All our time.

1208
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,620
好吧 伙计们
OK, everybody...

1209
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,020
收工
done here.

1210
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,430
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

1211
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:11,220
哦 我认出你了
Oh, I recognised ya.

1212
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,320
就在你追我车的时候
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

1213
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,750
夏洛克·福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes!

1214
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,790
有人警告我提防你
I was warned about you.

1215
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,810
我还上过你的网站 真不错 我喜欢
I've been on your website, too. Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

1216
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,330
谁警告你?       某个注意到你的人
Who warned you about me? Just someone out there who's noticed.

1217
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:31,960
谁?
Who?

1218
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,170
谁会注意到我?
Who would notice me?

1219
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,740
你真谦虚 福尔摩斯先生
You're too modest, Mr Holmes.

1220
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,230
我才没有
I'm really not.

1221
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,480
你有个粉丝了
Got yourself a fan.

1222
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,840
给我讲讲
Tell me more.

1223
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,890
只告诉你这些了
That's all you're going to know.

1224
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,150
在这辈子
In THIS lifetime.

1225
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,740
他这是干啥 他跑什么?
Why did he do that? Why did he have to leave?

1226
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,960
你比我了解他
You know him better than I do.

1227
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:03,050
我认识他5年了 不 我不了解他
I've known him for five years - and no, I don't.

1228
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,340
那你为什么忍受他?
So why do you put up with him?

1229
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,930
我是死马当活马医啊
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

1230
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,340
也因为夏洛克·福尔摩斯是个伟人
And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man -

1231
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,800
我想有一天 如果我们大家走运
and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky,

1232
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:19,600
他可能还会成为好人
he might even be a good one.

1233
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,010
我们在哪?
Where are we?

1234
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:46,560
你熟悉伦敦的大街小巷 你知道这是哪
You know every street in London. You know exactly where we are.

1235
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,450
罗兰克尔专科学校
Roland-Kerr Further Education College.

1236
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:52,000
为什么来这儿?       门开着
Why here? It's open.

1237
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,700
清洁工在打扫
Cleaners are in.

1238
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,865
开出租有个特点
One thing about being a cabbie -

1239
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,510
随时知道哪有僻静处适合谋杀
you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.

1240
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:01,120
真不明白我的同行们怎么不试试
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.

1241
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,790
受害人就跟你走进去? 为什么?
And you just walk your victims in? How?

1242
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,060
真没劲
Oh... Dull.

1243
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,020
别担心 好戏在后头
Don't worry. It gets better.

1244
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,610
你不能拿枪逼人自行了断的
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.

1245
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:15,070
我没有
I don't.

1246
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,000
比那要好多了
It's much better than that.

1247
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,020
对你不需要 因为你会跟着我的
Don't need this with you. Cos you'll follow me.

1248
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,650
你觉得怎样?
Well, what do you think?

1249
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,610
你说了算
It's up to you.

1250
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,980
毕竟你要在这送命了
You're the one who's going to die here.

1251
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,350
我不会的      他们都这么说
No, I'm not. That's what they all say.

1252
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,630
我们聊聊吧
Shall we talk?

1253
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,980
这不会有点冒险吗?
Bit risky, wasn't it?

1254
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,150
在一群警察眼皮底下把我带走
Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen.

1255
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:50,850
他们没那么傻
They're not that stupid.

1256
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,510
赫德森夫人也会记得你
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

1257
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,890
你管这叫风险? 嘁
You call that a risk? Nah...

1258
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,540
这才叫风险
THIS is a risk.

1259
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,880
我最爱这部分
Oh, I like this bit.

1260
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,770
因为你还不明白 是吗?
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

1261
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,380
马上就明白了
But you're about to.

1262
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,440
只要我拿出这个...
I just have to do this...

1263
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,290
这你可没料到吧?
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1264
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,720
这个保证你喜欢
Oh, you're going to love this.

1265
01:10:27,755 --> 01:10:28,935
喜欢什么?
Love what?

1266
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,380
夏洛克·福尔摩斯 看看你
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

1267
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:38,520
真的是你 你那个网站 你的粉丝给我讲过
Here in the flesh. That website of yours, your fan told me about it.

1268
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,110
我的粉丝?
My fan?

1269
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,630
你确实厉害
You are brilliant.

1270
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,900
你是不世出的天才
You are a proper genius.

1271
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,350
"演绎法研究" 我说 这...
The Science of Deduction. Now, that...

1272
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,570
才叫思考
is proper thinking.

1273
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,460
你我私下说说 为什么人们都不会思考?
Between you and me sitting here, why can't people think?

1274
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,420
你也快被逼疯了吧?
Don't it make you mad?

1275
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,190
他们怎么就不会思考呢?
Why can't people just think?

1276
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,480
哦 明白了 原来你也是不世出的天才
Oh, I see... So you're a proper genius too.

1277
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,220
看上去不像 对吧?
Don't look it, do I?

1278
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,500
开出租的小老头
Funny little man driving a cab.

1279
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,030
可你马上就会醒悟了
But you'll know better in a minute.

1280
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,520
这有可能是你今生知道的最后一件事了
Chances are it'll be the last thing you EVER know.

1281
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,240
好吧 两个瓶子 解释
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1282
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,840
一个好瓶子 一个坏瓶子
There's a good bottle and a bad bottle.

1283
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,890
吃了好瓶子里的药 你就活
You take the pill from the good bottle, you live.

1284
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,150
吃了坏瓶子里的药 你就死
You take the pill from the bad bottle... you die.

1285
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,780
两个瓶子是一样的吧      分毫不差
Both bottles are of course identical. In every way.

1286
01:11:38,815 --> 01:11:40,030
但你能分辨
And you know which is which.

1287
01:11:40,065 --> 01:11:40,900
我当然能
Of course I know.

1288
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:41,705
可我不知道
But I don't.

1289
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:45,395
你知道就不好玩了 你来选择
Wouldn't be a game if you knew. You're the one who chooses.

1290
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,050
我凭什么? 没理由 我能赢得什么?
Why should I? I've got nothing to go on. What's in it for me?

1291
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,470
我还没告诉你最好的事呢
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1292
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,500
不管你选哪瓶
Whatever bottle YOU choose,

1293
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,670
我都拿另一瓶的药
I take the pill from the other one.

1294
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,540
然后我们同时...
And then together...

1295
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,370
把药吃下
we take our medicine.

1296
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,260
我不会作弊 由你选择
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1297
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,240
我就吃你剩下的药
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1298
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,180
这你可没料到吧 福尔摩斯先生?
Didn't expect that, did you, Mr Holmes?

1299
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,435
这就是你对他们做的
This is what you did to the rest of them -

1300
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,220
给他们选择?       现在我给你
you gave them a choice? And now I'm giving you one.

1301
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,100
不必着急
You take your time.

1302
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,060
理清思绪
Get yourself together.

1303
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,645
拿出你最好的策略
I want your best game.

1304
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,825
这不是策略 这是50:50的概率
It's not a game, it's a 50:50 chance.

1305
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,970
我玩了四局了 我还活着
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1306
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,160
这不是概率 福尔摩斯先生 这是下棋
It's not chance, Mr Holmes, it's chess.

1307
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,990
这是一局棋
It's a game of chess,

1308
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,040
只有一步 只有一方能活
with one move... and one survivor.

1309
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,820
而这 这...
And this - this...

1310
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,970
就是唯一一步
is the move.

1311
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
我刚给你的是好瓶子还是坏瓶子?
Did I just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle?

1312
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,750
随你选一个
You can choose either one.

1313
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,730
不 找雷斯垂德探长 我有话跟他说
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade - I need to speak to him.

1314
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:11,430
非常重要 十万火急
It's important. It's an emergency.

1315
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,440
这里左转 谢谢 左转
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1316
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,120
准备好了吗 福尔摩斯先生?
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1317
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,595
开始玩吗?
Ready to play?

1318
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:31,085
玩什么? 这是50:50的概率
Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1319
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,730
你赌的不是数字 是我
You're not playing the numbers, you're playing ME.

1320
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,250
我刚给你的是好药还是坏药?
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?

1321
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,810
这是诈术吗
Is it a bluff,

1322
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,940
还是反诈
or a double bluff?

1323
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,245
还是三重反诈?       仍然只是概率
Or a triple bluff? It's still just chance.

1324
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,030
一连四个人? 这不是概率
Four people, in a row? It's not chance.

1325
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:49,200
运气      这是天才
Luck. It's genius!

1326
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,790
我知道人们的想法
I know how people think.

1327
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,360
我知道人们以为我怎么想
I know how people think I think.

1328
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,990
我脑子里仿佛有张地图
I can see it all like a map inside my head.

1329
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,960
人人都那么蠢 甚至你
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1330
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,910
或者神就是眷顾我
Or maybe God just loves me.

1331
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,770
不管哪样 你开出租都算糟蹋了
Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie.

1332
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,460
所以
So...

1333
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,370
你拿命赌了四次 杀了几个路人 为什么?
You risked your life four times just to kill strangers? Why?

1334
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,125
游戏开始了
Time to play.

1335
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,500
哦 我正在玩呢
Oh, I am playing.

1336
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,820
轮到我了
This is my turn.

1337
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,390
你左耳后沾着剃须泡沫
There's shaving foam behind your left ear.

1338
01:14:35,425 --> 01:14:36,780
没人提醒你
Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1339
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,035
从痕迹来看不止一次
Traces of where it's happened before,

1340
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,010
显然你是独居 没人提醒你
so obviously you live on your own - there's no-one to tell you.

1341
01:14:41,045 --> 01:14:42,635
可你有孩子的照片
But there's a photograph of children.

1342
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,140
孩子母亲被切掉了
Children's mother's been cut out of the picture.

1343
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:46,220
如果她死了 她还会在的
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1344
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,895
照片很旧 但框很新
The photograph's old, but the frame's new.

1345
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,580
你想念孩子 但不能去看他们
You think of your children, but you don't get to see them.

1346
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,600
疏离的父亲
Estranged father.

1347
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,600
她带走了孩子
She took the kids,

1348
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,030
可你还爱他们 还为此痛苦着
but you still love them and it still hurts.

1349
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,800
啊 可不止这些
Ah, but there's more.

1350
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,505
你的衣服 刚刚洗过
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1351
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,620
但你身上每件衣物至少...穿了三年了?
but everything you're wearing is at least... three years old?

1352
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,430
保持仪表 却无长远规划
Keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead.

1353
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:16,340
现在又沉迷于自毁式谋杀 这是为什么?
And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about?

1354
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,610
三年前 他们是那时告诉你的?
Three years ago. Is that when they told you?

1355
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:25,660
告诉我什么?
Told me what?

1356
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:26,875
（濒死）
DYING

1357
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,290
说你死到临头了      你也是
That you're a dead man walking. So are you.

1358
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,110
不过你时间不多了
You don't have long, though.

1359
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,620
我说的对吗?
Am I right?

1360
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,810
动脉瘤 就在这儿
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1361
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,630
每一口气都可能是最后一息
Any breath could be my last.

1362
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:45,200
因为你要死了 你就杀了四个人
And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people.

1363
01:15:45,235 --> 01:15:47,800
我活赢了四个人
I've outlived four people.

1364
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,240
对动脉瘤患者 这是最开心的事了
That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism.

1365
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:56,585
不 不 还有别的原因
No... No, there's something else.

1366
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,630
你不是因为愤懑杀了四个人
You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter.

1367
01:15:58,665 --> 01:16:00,790
愤懑是种麻醉剂
Bitterness is a paralytic.

1368
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,980
更危险的动机是爱
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1369
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,110
不知为什么 这是为了你的孩子
Somehow, this is about your children.

1370
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,590
你确实厉害 是吗?       可为什么呢?
You ARE good, in't ya? But how?

1371
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,840
我死了 我的孩子们拿不到什么
When I die they won't get much, my kids.

1372
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,705
开出租不挣钱
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1373
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,630
连环杀人也是      这你可失算了
Or serial killing. You'd be surprised.

1374
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,780
说来听听
Surprise me.

1375
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,060
我有个赞助人
I have a sponsor.

1376
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,665
你有什么?
You have a what?

1377
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,900
我每取一条命 孩子们就会拿到钱
For every life I take, money goes to my kids.

1378
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,280
我杀的越多 他们过得越好
The more I kill... the better off they'll be.

1379
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,480
你看 比你想的要划算
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1380
01:16:44,515 --> 01:16:46,747
谁会赞助连环杀手?
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1381
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,980
谁会迷恋夏洛克·福尔摩斯?
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1382
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,220
不是只有你能欣赏精彩的谋杀
You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder.

1383
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,520
世上还有你的同类 只不过你是孤家寡人
There's others out there just like you, except u're just a man.

1384
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,120
而他们远远不止于此
And they're so much more than that.

1385
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,110
你是说...
What do you mean...

1386
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,030
不止一个人?
more than a man?

1387
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,990
一个组织? 什么?
An organisation...? What?

1388
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,220
有一个名字 从没有人提起
There's a name, that no-one says.

1389
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,100
我也不会说
And I'm not going to say it either.

1390
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,840
闲话聊够了
Now, enough chatter.

1391
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,460
该做选择了
Time to choose.

1392
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,910
夏洛克
Sherlock?!

1393
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,320
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1394
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,340
要是我都不选呢? 我可以直接走掉
What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here.

1395
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,420
要么你赌50:50的概率
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1396
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,220
要么我一枪爆你头
or I can shoot you in the head.

1397
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,960
真有意思
Funnily enough,

1398
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,480
从没人选这个
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1399
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,630
我选择枪 谢谢
I'll have the gun, please.

1400
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,060
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1401
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,970
确定 枪
Definitely. The gun.

1402
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,860
你不想给朋友打个电话?
You don't want to phone a friend

1403
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,270
枪
The gun.

1404
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,250
枪的真假我一看便知
I know a real gun when I see one.

1405
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,850
他们都看不出      显然
None of the others did. Clearly.

1406
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,710
好吧 这游戏很有趣
Well, this has been very interesting.

1407
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,020
期待在法庭上再会
I look forward to the court case.

1408
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,250
走之前问一句 你想出来了吗?
Just before you go, did you figure it out?

1409
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,040
哪个是好瓶子?
Which one's the good bottle?

1410
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:39,190
当然 小菜一碟
OF Course. Child's play.

1411
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,950
好吧 哪一个?
Well, which one, then?

1412
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:43,745
你会选哪一个?
Which one would you have picked?

1413
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:46,450
让我知道我会不会赢你
Just so I know whether I could have beaten you.

1414
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,490
来吧
Come on!

1415
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,670
把游戏玩完
Play the game.

1416
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,300
有意思
Interesting.

1417
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,630
你看怎样?
So what do you think?

1418
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,340
一起吃?
Shall we?

1419
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,340
真的 你觉得呢?
Really... What do you think?

1420
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,980
你能赢我吗?
Can you beat me?

1421
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,700
你是不是聪明到
Are you clever enough...

1422
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,120
能赌自己的命?
.. to bet your life?

1423
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,560
夏洛克
SHERLOCK!

1424
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,740
我打赌你常常无聊 对吧?
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1425
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,760
我知道你会的
I know you do.

1426
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:02,560
你这样的人 这么聪明
A man like you. So clever.

1427
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,030
但你证明不了 那么再聪明又有什么用?
But what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it?

1428
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,460
仍然是瘾君子
Still the addict.

1429
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,890
可这个...这才是你真正的瘾
But this... this is what you're really addicted to.

1430
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,540
你会做一切
You'll do anything...

1431
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,560
不惜一切代价 来摆脱无聊
.. anything at all, to stop being bored.

1432
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,380
你现在不无聊了 对吧?
You're not bored now, are ya?

1433
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,330
这不是很好吗?
Isn't it good?

1434
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,670
我说的对吗?
Was I right?

1435
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,410
我说中了 不是吗?
I was, wasn't I?

1436
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,470
我选对了吗?
Did I get it right?!

1437
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,070
好吧 告诉我
OK... Tell me this.

1438
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:00,970
你的赞助人 是谁?
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1439
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:03,170
给你讲我的人 我的粉丝
The one who told you about me, my fan.

1440
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,780
给我个名字
I want a name.

1441
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,370
不
No...

1442
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,310
你快死了 但要折磨你还来得及
You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you.

1443
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,740
给我一个名字
Give me... a name.

1444
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,900
名字 快
A name! Now.

1445
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,910
名字
The name!

1446
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,310
莫里亚蒂
MORIARTY!

1447
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:49,010
为什么给我毯子? 他们老给我披毯子
Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me.

1448
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:51,280
安抚受刺激人士的      我没受刺激呀
Yeah, it's for shock. I'm not in shock.

1449
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,960
嗯 可有些人需要拍照
Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs.

1450
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,125
开枪的人呢 没痕迹?
So, the shooter. No sign?

1451
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,795
趁我们没到逃走了
Cleared off before we got here.

1452
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,060
不过那种人有仇家也挺正常
But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.

1453
01:22:01,095 --> 01:22:03,450
可能有人跟踪他来 不过...
One of them could have been following him, but...

1454
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:05,570
我们毫无线索
we've got nothing to go on.

1455
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,180
哦 我可不觉得
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1456
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,220
好吧 说来听听
OK. Give me.

1457
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,060
墙里挖出的子弹是手枪的
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun.

1458
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,515
隔这么远一枪毙命
A kill shot over that distance,

1459
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,245
我们要找的是个神枪手
that's a crack shot,WE ARE LOOKING FOR.

1460
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,970
不止枪法好 他是个战士
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1461
01:22:19,005 --> 01:22:20,697
手丝毫没有抖
His hands couldn't have shaken at all

1462
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,355
可见他熟悉暴力
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1463
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,090
但直到我命悬一线才开枪
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger though,

1464
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:26,370
可见道德感极强
so strong moral principle.

1465
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:27,615
你要找的人
You're looking for a man

1466
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,240
大概服过兵役 而且...
probably with a history of military service, and...

1467
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,140
沉着果敢 坚韧如钢...
nerves of steel...

1468
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:39,820
算了 我说 别理我了
Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.

1469
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,335
什么?      别听我说的
Sorry? Ignore all of that.

1470
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:44,240
那是...受刺激说胡话
It's just the er... the shock talking.

1471
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:44,715
你去哪?
Where are you going?

1472
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,720
我得去谈...房租
I just need to... talk about the rent.

1473
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:48,655
我还有话问你      又怎么啦?
I've still got questions. What now?

1474
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,440
我受刺激了 看 都披毯子了
I'm in shock - look, I've got a blanket.

1475
01:22:50,475 --> 01:22:51,235
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1476
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:56,190
而且我刚给你抓住个连环杀手...多少算吧
And, I just caught you a serial killer... More or less.

1477
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:01,870
好吧 明天再找你 你走吧
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow, off you go.

1478
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,460
多诺万警官... 解释了事情经过
Erm - Sergeant Donovan has... just been explaining everything.

1479
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,930
那两颗药丸...
The two pills...

1480
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,390
真阴毒对吧? 真阴毒
Dreadful business, isn't it? Dreadful.

1481
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,650
好枪法
Good shot.

1482
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,120
对对 肯定很难 还隔着窗户
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through that window.

1483
01:23:24,155 --> 01:23:25,110
嗯 你最清楚了
Well, you'd know.

1484
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,770
得把你手上的火药灼伤弄掉
Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers.

1485
01:23:28,805 --> 01:23:30,210
应该不会判你刑
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this,

1486
01:23:30,245 --> 01:23:32,440
不过我们还是别上法庭的好
but let's avoid the court case.

1487
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,825
你没事吧      对 我当然没事
Are you all right? Yes, of course I'm all right.

1488
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,930
你刚杀了一个人      对...
Well, you have just killed a man. Yes...

1489
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,980
是真的 对吧?
That's true, isn't it?

1490
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,300
可他也不是什么好人
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1491
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,425
对 他可真不是好人
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?

1492
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,190
什么破司机啊
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

1493
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,635
就是 他根本不会开车
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1494
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,170
你该瞧瞧他开过来绕的路
You should have seen the route he took us to get here.

1495
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:59,705
我们不能笑 这是杀人现场啊 快别说啦
Stop it! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1496
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,380
喂 你可是凶手啊      小声点
Well, you're the one who shot him. Keep your voice down.

1497
01:24:02,415 --> 01:24:05,020
抱歉 我有点...亢奋 抱歉
Sorry, it's just erm... nerves, I think. Sorry.

1498
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,630
你真打算吃那颗药了 对吧?
You were going to take that damn pill, weren't you?

1499
01:24:08,665 --> 01:24:09,950
我才没有呢
Course I wasn't.

1500
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,600
我是拖延时间 就知道你会来
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1501
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:14,980
你哪知道啊
No, you didn't.

1502
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,990
这就是你找刺激的方式 对吗
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it -

1503
01:24:17,025 --> 01:24:18,400
赌上性命证明你聪明
you risk your life to prove you're clever.

1504
01:24:18,435 --> 01:24:19,842
我为什么呀?
Why would I do that?

1505
01:24:19,877 --> 01:24:21,250
因为你是个傻瓜
Because you're an idiot.

1506
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:25,710
饭去?       饿死了
Dinner? Starving.

1507
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:28,600
贝克街有家中餐馆不错 开到凌晨2点
End of Baker Street there's a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1508
01:24:28,635 --> 01:24:31,250
看中餐馆好坏 要看门把手底部1/3
You can tell a good Chinese by the bottom third of the door handle.

1509
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,880
夏洛克 就是他 我跟你说的那人
Sherlock... That's him, that's the man I was talking to you about.

1510
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:37,000
我非常清楚他是谁
I know exactly who that is.

1511
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,140
好呀 又一个案子破了
So... Another case cracked.

1512
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,600
真是造福大众啊
How very public-spirited.

1513
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,420
不过这从来就不是你的动机 对吧?
Though that's never really your motivation, is it?

1514
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,165
你来这干什么?
What are you doing here?

1515
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,265
照例 我来关心你的
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1516
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,510
对 我听说你的"关心"了
Yes, I've been hearing about your "concern".

1517
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,385
还是这么别扭
Always so aggressive.

1518
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,720
你就没想过我和你是一个阵营的吗?
Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?

1519
01:24:56,755 --> 01:24:58,635
真奇怪 没有
Oddly enough - no.

1520
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,540
我们的共同点可比你愿意相信的多
We have more in common than you'd like to believe.

1521
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,335
我们俩这种意气之争实在太幼稚了
This petty feud between us is simply childish.

1522
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:08,750
总是殃及无辜 你也知道这惹妈妈生气
People will suffer. And you know how it always upset Mummy.

1523
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,180
我惹妈妈生气?
I upset her?

1524
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:12,470
我?
Me?

1525
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,670
惹她的可不是我 麦克罗夫特
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1526
01:25:15,705 --> 01:25:17,270
喂 喂 等一下
No. No, wait...

1527
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,885
妈妈? 谁是妈妈?
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1528
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,270
母亲 我们的母亲
Mother. Our mother.

1529
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,890
这是我哥哥 麦克罗夫特
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1530
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:25,060
你又增重啦?
Putting on weight again?

1531
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,840
不好意思 是减了
Losing it, in fact.

1532
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:28,145
他是你哥哥?
He's your brother?

1533
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,700
他当然是我哥哥
Course he's my brother.

1534
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,920
那他不是...      不是什么?
So he's not... Not what?

1535
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,770
我不知道 地下阴谋家?
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

1536
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,030
差不多吧      老天爷
Close enough. For goodness' sake.

1537
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,750
我只是英国政府里小小的一员
I occupy a minor position in the British government.

1538
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:43,860
他就是英国政府
He IS the British government,

1539
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,600
在他不忙着当英国情报局的时候
when he's not too busy being the British secret service

1540
01:25:45,635 --> 01:25:48,310
或者不跑去客串美国中情局的时候
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1541
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,080
晚上好 麦克罗夫特
Good evening, Mycroft.

1542
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,340
在我到家前请尽量别发动战争
Try not to start a war before I get home,

1543
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:54,100
你知道交通会变成什么样
you know what it does for the traffic.

1544
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:59,150
所以 你说你关心他的时候
So, when you say you're concerned about him -

1545
01:25:59,185 --> 01:26:00,580
你还真是关心他?
you actually are concerned?

1546
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:02,010
对 当然
Yes, of course.

1547
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,190
我说 这真的是小孩子赌气?
I mean, it actually is a childish feud?

1548
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,470
他一贯这么气鼓鼓的
He's always been so resentful.

1549
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:10,140
能想象我们家圣诞晚宴什么样吧
You can imagine the Christmas dinners.

1550
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,240
嗯...
Yeah...

1551
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:12,890
不 天啊 不能
No... God, no.

1552
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,630
我还是...
I'd better erm...

1553
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:17,870
又见面了
Hello again.

1554
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,960
你好      我们今天傍晚见过
Hello. We met earlier on this evening.

1555
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,120
哦      好吧 晚安
Oh! OK. Goodnight.

1556
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:26,960
晚安 华生医生
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

1557
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,065
吃点心去      嗯
So, dim sum. Mmm!

1558
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,320
我总能猜到幸运饼里的签语      吹吧你
I can always predict the fortune cookies. No, you can't.

1559
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,560
几乎能 话说你还是中过枪吧
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

1560
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,005
什么?       在阿富汗 确实受过伤
Sorry? In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound.

1561
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,390
哦 对 肩膀      肩膀 我就知道
Oh. Yeah, shoulder. Shoulder! I thought so.

1562
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:40,915
才怪      左边吧
No, you didn't. The left one.

1563
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,420
算你蒙对了      我从不瞎蒙
Lucky guess. I never guess.

1564
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,960
你就是瞎蒙
Yes, you do.

1565
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,900
你兴奋什么呢?       莫里亚蒂
What are you so happy about? Moriarty.

1566
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:47,855
什么莫里亚蒂?
What's Moriarty?

1567
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:50,220
我一点也不知道
I've absolutely no idea.

1568
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,490
长官 走吗?
Sir, shall we go?

1569
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,820
那当兵的 真有意思
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1570
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,160
他也许是我弟的救星...
He could be the making of my brother...

1571
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:01,890
或者让他更加不可救药
or make him worse than ever.

1572
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:06,200
无论如何 还是提升他们的监视等级吧
Either way, we'd better upgrade their surveillance status.

1573
01:27:06,235 --> 01:27:08,085
启动第三级监视
Grade three active.

1574
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,600
抱歉 长官 谁的监视等级?
Sorry, sir - whose status?

1575
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,790
夏洛克·福尔摩斯和华生医生
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson

1576
