295
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,513
你的女人没有母乳喂养她们吗
Your wife is not breastfeeding?

296
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,182
我 我只是有点搞不明白
I-I-I di-- I don't-- I just don't get it.

297
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,351
我的意思是 艾米只是咬了她几次而已 又能怎样呢
I mean, Amy bites her a couple of times and what?

298
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:09,686
她就不再想喂她了
She just quits the gig?

299
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,521
想像你正在游泳
Imagine you are swimming.

300

小鲨鱼不知从那冒出来
And baby shark comes out of nowhere,

用它们尖尖的牙齿戳你的卵蛋

宝宝咬乳头就是这种感觉
This is what it feels like when they bite nipple.

303

就像他们宣战了一样
Like they have declared war.

304
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:24,284
也可以说 如果你手里有把锤子
Like, if you have a hammer in your hand,

305
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:27,087
你就想把这小东西的脑浆锤出来

就是这种感觉
This is what it feels like.

307

糟糕 我应该给小维道歉

就算是这样 也没理由不喂母乳呀
But still, it's no reason to quit.

我老公对照顾宝宝没兴趣
My husband has no interest in baby.

312

Two babies, no help?

Really?

318
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,546
利亚姆 你把冰淇淋弄得到处都是

321
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,636
根本不是什么事儿
It wasn't even a thing.

322
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,889

贱人
Scumbag.

他们就是些长了一身肥肉的混蛋
They were just fat assholes.

329

菲奥娜 我经营一个餐馆
I run a restaurant, Fiona.

不 只是你要再进一次监狱吗
No, it's just you-- you could have gone

333
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,301
就因为三块钱 -你在说什么
to jail for what, three bucks? - What are you talking about?

334
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,969
虽然你取下了监控器
So you take off your monitor,

335
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:09,272
但你还在观察期 却当街吵架
you're still on probation. Fighting in the street?

336
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:10,724
为什么要去去瞎搅合
Why are you stirring shit?

337
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:12,642
我只是去要小费
I went out there to ask about my tip.

338
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:15,645
是你突然变得像个疯狗一样
You're the one who turned into a rabid dog.

339
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:17,481
我可没说那不性感
Not that I didn't find that sexy,

340
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,316
但我不会撒谎的 但是 你知道的
I'm not going to lie, but, you know,

没饿死之前 快离开那
before one of those fat assholes starves.

345
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,834
我认为查克只是轻微的智力迟钝
I think Chuckie's mildly retarded.

346
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,336
得有人告诉萨米
Someone should probably tell Sammi.

弗兰克 你猜不到发生了什么 
Frank, you'll never guess what happened.

我们可以去任何地方 我们可以到处去玩
We could go anywhere. We could travel anywhere,

00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,689
买了一个还不错的公寓 突然间 它向南
right near downtown. And then suddenly, it's moved

426
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:48,775
移动了四十个街区 接着又移动了八十个街区
40 blocks south. And then 80 blocks.

427
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:51,361
-什么时候会是终点  -好吧 也许 
- Where does it end? - Well, maybe it ends

428
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:54,164
会以我们两个坐在房车里游览这个国家为终点
with you and me in an RV seeing the country.

429
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,332
这就像他们对待犹太人那样
This is just like with the Jews.

430
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,201
十年以来 他们一直声称 这样的事情绝对不会发生
Ten years from now, they'll claim it "Never happened,"

431
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,121
但它还是发生了 他们想让能付得起税的人
but it is happening. They want to move people in

432
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:05,008
搬进来 所以他们要赶我们走
who can pay taxes. So they push us out.

433
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:07,460
最终 我们只能流落街头
And eventually, we end up in a camp somewhere

434
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,846
-永远处于主流文明的边缘  -哦
- at the edge of civilization. - Oh.

435
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:13,967
一个建立在垃圾填埋场和有毒废弃物处理厂之上的流动城市
A tent city built on old landfills and toxic waste sites.

436
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:17,353
接着我们会染上天花
And then they start passing out the smallpox blankets.

437
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:18,722
哦 弗兰克 我是说
Oh, Frank, I mean--

438
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,857
也许就是那对女同性恋
Maybe that's the lesbians

439
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,358
-她们可能会出更多的钱  -好吧
- with more money. - Okay.

440
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:24,277
也许是来和女同性恋竞争的人
Or maybe it's competing lesbians.

441
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:25,628
-等等 你等一下  -不不 不 弗兰克
- Wait, would you wait? - No, no, no, Frank.

442
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,898
你就不能等一下吗
Would you wait a second?

443
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,533
你好
Oh, hello.

444
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,036
你好 我 我叫韦德 谢尔顿
Hello. I-I-- My name is Wade Shelton.

445
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:34,738
我是来找弗兰克 加拉格的
I'm looking for Frank Gallagher.

446
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,657
他移植了我儿子的肝脏
He was the recipient of my son's liver.

447
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,909
-哦 快进来  -谢谢
- Oh, oh, come in. - Thank you.

448
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,245
-进来吧  -你不能再把肝脏要回去了
- Come in. - You can't have it back.

449
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,247
哦 您别介意
Oh, don't mind him.

450
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,633
那些药物的劲还没过去 他还有些晕呢
That medical marijuana makes him a little loopy.

451
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,169
你好 我是弗兰克的女儿 萨米
Hi, I'm Frank's daughter, Sammi.

452
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:50,637
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hi.

453
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:52,639
有什么能帮到您的 谢尔顿先生
How can we help you, Mr. Shelton?

454
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,591
我 我本不想来打扰你们的 但是我和我的妻子
Oh, I-I-I don't want to bother you, but my wife and I

455
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:56,092
我们想在今天下午
were going to have a little supper this afternoon

456
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,594
招待一下我们儿子的器官接受者
for all our son's organ recipients,

457
00:20:57,596 --> 00:21:01,397
-一个小小的庆祝  -多好的主意
- a little celebration. - What a wonderful idea.

458
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,683
谢谢 我的本意是
Thank you. Yeah, my way of...

459
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:06,019
想和我儿子过最后一个父亲节

00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,271
很抱歉这么晚才通知您
And I'm so sorry for the late notice.

461
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,273
我真的很抱歉 但是我真的找了您很久
I-I really am, but well, we had a little trouble

462
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:12,442
我知道这有点奇怪
tracking you down. I know this may seem odd,

463
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:15,245
但向您这样的器官接受者 是我们对儿子仅存的念想
but you organ recipients, you're all that we have left

464
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
所以能否请您 你们两个

啊呀 疼 别碰我
Ow, ow, ow, stop it.

没人碰你
No one's touching you.

476
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,817
够了
Enough.

477
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,236
该你们照顾利亚姆了 别让他淹死了
Your turn to hang with Liam. Don't let him drown.

478
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:05,879
嗨

你迷路了吗
Are you lost?

482
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,016
嘿

483
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,152

00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,523
二 三
Two, three.

想你的孩子了 是吗
Miss your kid, huh?

491
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:50,039
好像我的全身都在燃烧
Like a burn all over my body.

492
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:54,043
上菜啦
Order's up.

493

波士顿奶油和和爪哇红茶

-又像是宿醉的一天  -你能记住所有

495
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:04,437
你最爱顾客们的常用订单吗
of all of your favorite customers?

496
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,189
只记住了你们几个未来摇滚之星的
Just the future rock stars.

497
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:08,057
呦 你今天没带电子脚铐
Oh, you got no ankle monitor.

498
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,809
是啊 终于自由了
Yeah, free at last.

499
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:13,229
这样的话你今晚就没有什么借口再错过我们的演出了吧
Oh, so you have no excuse to miss our show tonight.

500
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,064
-哥们 我们是来这里吃饭的  -嗯？
- Dude, we eat here. - So?

501
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,199
所以在这儿就别表现得像只狗似的行吗
So don't act like a dog in here.

502
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:17,400
请随便无视他
Feel free to ignore him.

503
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:19,202
他存在感可挺强的
He's kinda hard to ignore.

504
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,871
-哥们 我们真是来这里吃饭的  -可我没办法克制啊
- Dude, we eat here. - 'Cause I-I can't help myself.

505
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,707
你知道 我认为 认为她可能成为我的洋子
You know, I think-- I think she might be my Yoko.

506
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:26,042
所以你这是要把我列在你的观众名单上吗
So you're going to put me on a list?

507
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:29,545
是啊 来看看怎样
Yeah. Check it out, hmm.

508
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:30,997
对了 你也可以带上你男人
Oh, you can bring your man too.

509
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,583
-挺酷炫的嘛  -他不是我男人
- That's cool. - He's not my man.

510
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,219
老板而已
Just my boss.

511
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,420
所以你这是笃信
So you do believe

512
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:38,888
放任他们大声喊叫这招管用
in letting them cry it out?

513
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:41,591
笃信 不 我认为那是虐待儿童
Believe? No, I think it's child abuse.

514
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,259
但我认为有时候只是看你怎么称呼它
But sometimes I think it's, how you call it?

515
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:45,428
无可避免之灾祸 像是用热蜡除逼毛一样
"Necessary evil." Like waxing pussy.

516
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,063
对 我非常同意你说的
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

517
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,516
尤其面对这两个熊孩子 有时候就像  草泥马
Especially with two. Sometimes it's like, fuck!

518
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:52,936
是的 那场面让人脑补无能
Yeah, I cannot imagine having two.

519
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,104
现在说也没用了 你马上就能体会到有俩孩子的滋味了
What are you talking about? You're about to have two.

520
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:57,824
不 这只是代孕 我把自己的子宫像青年招待所一样出租了出去
No, a surrogate. I rent uterus like youth hostel.

521
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,075
这酸爽 是啊说起来
That's cool. Yeah, my mom-in-law

522
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,610
我丈母娘为了我们也做了同样的事
did something like that for us.

523
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:04,163
只不过她要养小孩 这点我无法接受
Except she kept the baby, which is kinda wrong.

524
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,782
-你可别重蹈覆辙  -不会 我只是为了钱
- Don't do that. - No, I get money.

525
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:08,084
一半开始 一半分娩
Half to start, half to deliver.

526
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,370
我将要分娩
I will deliver.

527
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:12,588
你知道 和你闲逛 谈论这些婴儿话题 
You know, this is cool. Hanging out with you,

528
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,290
这让我感觉倍儿爽
talking about all this baby stuff.

529
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,509
首先 来 宝贝 
You know, at first-- Come here, honey.

530
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:18,461
跟你说真的
To be honest with you,

531
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:21,130
我一直以为你和那些提供手淫的婊子一样
I always thought you were just some handjob whore.

532
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:22,632
没事 其实我之前也一直以为
Oh, it's okay. I thought you were

533
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:24,300
你是在酒吧当个酒保没什么文化的男妓呢
illiterate bartender pimp.

534
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,602
呵呵 嗷嗷嗷嗷 我的头发
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow.

535
00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:28,304
我觉得 你需要理发了
You know, you need haircut.

536
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,473
我也这么觉得 可是小维喜欢长发
Yeah, I know. But V likes it long.

537
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:32,058
进来吧
Come in.

538
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,978
你好呀小黛 知道斯维特拉娜么
Hey Debs. Do you know Svetlana?

539
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,397
当然 她是我哥哥的爱人的替代妈妈
Of course, she's my brother's lover's baby mama.

540
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,065
没错 你来干啥
Right. What do you want?

541
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,651
游泳池里有只死老鼠 你能帮我处理了么
There's a rat in the pool. Can you fish it out?

542
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,153
在余下的夏日里 我对公共泳池感到绝望了
I am done with the public pool for the rest of the summer.

543
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,072
当然没问题 你能帮我照看一会儿艾米和吉玛么
Sure, no problem. But can you watch Amy and Gemma

544
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:49,709
干脆游一次泳好了
for a while? A swim sounds nice.

545
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,499
为什么你对公共泳池感到绝望
Why you done with public pool?

546
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:57,667
难不成有人在里面拉屎吗
Someone shit in it?

547
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,052
不是
No.

548
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:02,005
那是有人惹到你了吗
Someone shit on you?

549
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:04,924
稍稍有一点吧
Sort of.

550
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,844
你能教我如何起作用吗
Can you teach me how it all works?

551
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,178
什么起什么作用
How what works?

552
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,813
如何让男人们对我如饥似渴
How you make guys want you,

553
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,982
他们什么时候会那样做 那时候我又该做些什么
and when they do, what do you actually do?

554
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:15,184
我的意思是 我虽然看过黄片 但我没怎么看懂
I mean, I've seen porn, but I'm not sure I understand

555
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:17,687
那些技术性细节 你是这方面的专家
all the technicalities. And you're a professional,

556
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:20,606
所以我觉得你应该是为我解疑的最佳人选
so I figure you're the best person to ask.

557
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:22,909
也请不要以觉得我是个智障或者孩子的口气来职责我
And please don't accuse me of being retarded or a child,

558
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,663
因为我我已经准备好了
because I'm neither.

559
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:31,834
我们可以去看凯伦 还有乔迪
We could see Karen. And Jody.

560
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,203
我们可以去看总统山
We could see Mount Rushmore.

561
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:38,091
我们可以去新墨西哥
We could go see where the-- where the aliens landed

562
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:40,043
看外星人着陆的地方
in New Mexico.

563
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:43,713
额 或者 或者我们去看火人节
Or-- or-- or we could see The Burning Man.

564
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:47,633
火人节 弗兰克 最重要的是 弗兰克
The Burning Man, Frank. And mostly, Frank,

565
00:25:47,685 --> 00:25:51,604
这样我们就能摆脱萨米
we could get away from Sammi.

566
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:55,191
求你了 弗兰克 真求你了 不要在这方面和我争执了好吗
Please, Frank, please. Please don't fight me on this.

567
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:58,778
她挖掘了我内在的某种机能
Because she just brings something out in me.

他生性勇敢 死得也勇敢
He died bravely, the way he lived.

713
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:38,737
他与一个入室窃贼殊死搏斗
He was fighting off a home invader.

714
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:41,440
真希望我曾经教过他要逃跑
I really wish that I'd taught him to run

715
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:43,742

我是弗兰克的女儿 萨米
I'm Frank's daughter, Sammi,

730
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:26,785
这是他的孙儿 查克

731
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:29,238
如果我们来迟了我很抱歉
I am so sorry if we're late.

732
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
查克要非去拉屎 真烦
Chuckie had to go number two real bad,

733
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:35,461
所以我们耽搁了一些时间
so, we lost a little time.

734
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,913
我妈妈心都碎了
My mother's heartbroken.

735

我爸他 又开始喝酒了
My father, he started drinking again.

736
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:44,169
然后是我哥 他根本不听劝
And my brother, he won't listen to reason.

737
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:47,973
他为什么选择了当基佬 而不要家庭
Why would he choose faggotry over his family?

738
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:50,092
为什么
Why?

739
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:52,428
这是种毁灭之罪 曼迪
It's a sin that destroys, Mandy.

740
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,515
你要把这种罪孽与你的生活彻底切断

741
00:34:56,567 --> 00:35:00,269
我有差不多三十天没吸了
I'm just under 30 days clean.

742
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:05,107
但我仍然每天都很想吸
And I still think about using every day.

743
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,778
因为它是永恒的诱惑
Because it's a constant temptation.

744
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,281
就像在对我叫喊
Like a yearning.

745
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:16,619
我感受到它在肌肤脾胃中的流动
I feel it in my stomach and my skin.

746
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,694
不 不 不 算了吧
No, no, no. Forget it.

747
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:43,312
放屁吧你
Bullshit, man!

748
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:44,813
-那不是我的主意 -操你祖宗 我不管
- It was not my idea. - Fuck that, I don't care.

749
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,749
上吧 这是唯一的办法了
Come on. It's the only way to do it.

750
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,317
-总得有人做 -没门
- Somebody's got to do it. - No way.

751
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,902
-肯定有别的法子 -谁要去做
- There's another way. - Who's doing it?

752
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:52,404
-我不干 -我来吧
- Not me. - I'll do it.

753
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:54,289
不 你会用力过猛然后杀了那个狗娘养的
No, you'll go overboard and kill a son of a bitch,

754
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,708
-你自己心里清楚 -好吧
- and you know it. - All right.

755
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:57,376
那你来 这是你的主意
You do it. It's your idea.

756
00:35:57,411 --> 00:35:58,994
这正是为什么我不用亲自去做
That's exactly why I don't have to do it.

757
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:01,380
-因为这是我的主意 -听着 听着
- It's my idea. - Listen, listen--

758
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,082
-我可以把他那妈个巴子的头盖骨敲碎
- I'll crush his fucking skull,

759
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:06,669
但是不 我不干这票 太操蛋了
but no, I'm not playing this. It's too fucked up.

760
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:08,637
操 伊恩说得对 那个狗娘养的
Fuck that, Ian's right. The son of a bitch

761
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:11,223
确实该死
deserves to die.

762
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,844
让我来吧 我要为国而战
I'll do it. I'll do it for my country.

763
00:36:15,846 --> 00:36:18,063
为军而战 为你们所有人而战
For the army. For all of you.

764
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,231

为了你的国家
For your country.

766

操他妈的 他人呢 你应该给他下药的
Where the fuck is he? You were supposed to drug him.

767
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:28,107
没必要 他已经上路了
Didn't have to. He's on his way.

768
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,832
好吧 让我看看你的脸
Okay. Show me your face now.

769
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:41,336
-我的脸 -你诱惑的那一面
- My face? - Your seductions face.

770
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,512
你没有母亲吗
You have no mother?

771
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:54,883
-嗯 算不上有 -好吧
- Uh, not really. - Okay.

772
00:36:57,521 --> 00:36:59,688
噢 这是干嘛用的
Ooh, what's that for?

773
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:04,610
我妈对我做过的 我现在要对你来做
So I could do for you what my mother did for me.

774
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,062
我的儿子曾经是
My son was--

775
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,531
现在也是 我生活的中心
My son is the center of my life.

776
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:12,868
在这个令人痛苦的父亲节
It just-- it means so much to us to have you here

777
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,403
你们能来这儿对我们而言太有意义了
on this very painful Father's Day.

778
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,991
十八年来我第一次没跟我儿子一起过 所以
My first in 18 years without my boy, so--

779
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:20,743
真的好巧啊
That is such a coincidence.

780
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:27,416
这也是我过的第一个有父亲在的父亲节
Because this is my first Father's Day ever with a dad.

你 你不应该喝酒
You-- you are not supposed to drink

786
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,599
你做了肝移植手术
when you have a donor liver.

787
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:46,018
正好相反 我做了大量调查研究
On the contrary, I've done extensive research,

788
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,772
如果我按照正常的节奏生活
and this liver will last me close to a decade

789
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:53,909
这个肝能让我活上快十年
if I pace myself correctly.

790
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:55,611
对 管他的 有人有烟吗
Well, fuck it. Anybody got a smoke?

791
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:57,913

快把你的舌头收进去
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

797
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:11,627
这他妈是在干啥
What is this shit?

798
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,178
五分钟前你还是个乖宝宝呢
Five minutes ago you were a baby.

799
00:38:13,214 --> 00:38:14,429

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,684
- 我就当这是承认了 - 菲奥娜会疯掉的
- But, this means yes. - You know, Fiona's gonna flip.

802
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,136
我不再是个孩子了 请接受这点
I'm not a baby anymore, Kev. Deal.

803
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:22,855
我不能 你能把那玩意儿放下吗
I can't would you put that down?

804
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,306
而且为啥这上面套了只安全套
Why is there a condom on it?

805
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:26,642
哦 你就知道说别人是吧
Oh, and what about you, huh?

806
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:29,311
你老婆怕麻烦 所以不给孩子们母乳喂养
Your wife no like pain, so she takes breasts away from babies.

807
00:38:29,363 --> 00:38:33,315
你也怕麻烦 所以解决方法是把你的头发剪掉
You don't like pain, so we take hair away from babies.

808
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:35,234
得了吧 你家里到底谁在做主呢
Come on, who wears testicles in family?

809

是你 还是你老婆
You or wife? Huh?

要喝点儿酒祛祛痛苦吗

你和肖恩到底有没有在交往啊
You and Sean, you're a thing?

821

-你要不要去 -我不行啊

00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:22,197

你连陪我去看场乐队演出都不行吗
You can't come see a band with me?

835

和才加入互助会的人交往 不过
supposed to date newcomers or whatever, but...

840
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:27,596
我并不能算是互助会的新人 因为我压根
I'm not really a newcomer 'cause I'm not really

841
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,731

a drug addict, so...

不 我 我会伤害我自己的 瞧 你之所以去互助会
No, I-- I'd be damaging me. See, you go to these meetings

844
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,106
是因为法官要求你这么做 这很好
because the judge ordered you too, and it's fun,

845
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,408
你还可以学到东西
and you learn a little something.

846
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,444
但对我来说 这些互助会 呃
But for me, those meetings, uh,

847
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:44,863
你知道的 拯救了我的人生

好的 我懂 我懂

我不会再在互助会上与你调情了
I'll stop flirting in the meetings.

851
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,174
不仅仅是在互助会上 你知道吗 这就是场灾难
It's not just the meetings, you know, it's chaos.

852
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,594
-你到哪里 哪里就是场灾难 -但我已经在改善了
- Just chaos follows you around. - But I'm doing better.

853
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,430
你自己取下了监控器
You took your monitor off yourself.

854
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,131
-所以呢 -你应该等等的
- So?  - So you should have waited

855
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:04,466
-等警官来帮你取 -不过就是个监控器
- for the PO and you know it. - That's a technicality.

856
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:06,018
怎么 你要因此而教育我吗
You're going to judge me for that?

857
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:07,386
不 我并不想教育你
No, I'm not going to judge you for that,

858
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:10,105
我反而希望你这么做
I'm going to want you for that.

859
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,809
我认为你用螺丝刀取下监控器
I find it charming as fuck

860
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:15,811
这件事真是太他妈棒了
that you took a screwdriver to your monitor,

861
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:17,896
而且你午饭前因为打架而造成嘴角流血 这对我来说
and I find it sexy as hell that you had a bloody lip

862
00:41:17,948 --> 00:41:20,148
-也是要命一般的性感 -你在逗我玩儿吗
- before lunch today. - Are you making fun of me?

863
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,986
不 我只是在说你是个混乱制造机 菲奥娜
No, it's just you're a chaos junkie, Fiona.

864
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:26,154
而我更是混乱混乱机 我爱死混乱了
And I'm a junkie junkie, so I love chaos,

865
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:29,074
但一旦我真的混乱起来 一切都会变糟
and when I get into chaos, bad shit follows.

866
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,376
- 而像你这样的女人 -我这样的女人
- And women like you-- - Women like me?

867
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:36,164
是啊 如此火辣 性感
Yeah. Wo-- Hot, sexy,

868
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,666
难以拒绝
irresistible,

869
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:39,167
有趣
fun,

870
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:41,003
喜欢制造麻烦
troublemaking,

871
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:42,888
不乱不休
chaos causing,

872
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:46,058
你这样的女人
women like you...

873
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,517
就是我在沉迷于海洛因之前的毒药
were my drug of choice long before I got into smack.

874
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:57,686
其实挺有趣的
It's funny, in fact.

875
00:42:00,357 --> 00:42:03,658
正是有个像你一样的女人让我吸食了第一口
It was a woman just like you shot me up the first time.

876
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:05,660
-我绝不会让你这么做的 -是的我知道
- I would never do that. - No, I know.

877
00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:07,863
但你会让我再次堕落的 菲奥娜
But you're a slippery slope for me, Fiona.

878
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:09,581
就因为今早上那个人没有给你小费这件事
I coulda beat that guy to death this morning

879
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,783
我可以把他打成半死
'cause he didn't tip you.

880
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:14,703
这当然不是你的错 完全不是
And it's not your fault. That is not on you.

881
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:17,289
是我自己的错
That's on me.

882
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:20,375
但是我 我有个儿子
But I-I have a son.

883
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,712
不论我有多么多么想要变坏 或者是
And I won't risk my relationship with my son

884
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:26,548
多么想和你一起做疯狂的事
no matter how badly I...

885
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,885
我都不能 决不能那我 和我儿子
want to do very, very bad things

886
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:34,723
之前的关系来冒险
both to and with you.

887
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:39,394
我不是场灾难
I'm not just chaos.

888
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:42,364
我已经改善了 我在改善了
I'm better. I've changed.

889
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:46,568
我觉得我真的会对你很好的
I think I could be really good for you.

890
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,074
我希望你继续参加这些互助会
I hope you keep coming to these meetings

891
00:42:52,126 --> 00:42:55,077
因为我觉得它们真的能帮助别人
'cause I think they help everyone.

892
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:57,579
但我请求你
But I'm asking you--

893
00:42:57,581 --> 00:43:00,799
我真的请求你 菲奥娜
I'm really asking you, Fiona.

894
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:05,170
下次请不要坐我旁边了
Just sit somewhere else when you do.

895
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:21,570
嘿
Hey.

896
00:43:21,605 --> 00:43:24,606
哦天啊 你乳房上面那个是艾米吗
Oh, my God. Is that Amy on your tit?

897
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:26,608
但她真的很喜欢我乳房啊
Who can tell them apart?

898
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,443
苦了你了 宝贝 凯文
Come here, baby. Kevin!

899
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:33,281

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,202
你的头发去哪儿了 这他妈什么鬼
What happened to your head? Wh-- what the fuck?

902
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:39,788
你完全不知道这样有多清爽
You have no idea how good this feels.

903
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,456
以后每个夏天我们都该把头发剪掉
We should shave our head every fucking summer.

904
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,625
啥 我 等等
What? I-- Wait.

905
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:46,094
好吧 首先
Okay. First of all,

906
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,763
为什么我的女儿在一个妓女的乳房上
why was there a hooker's tit in my baby's mouth?

907
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:51,349
好了好了 这个妓女可是我们认识的斯维特拉娜
All right, with the hooker. It's Svetlana.

908
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,018
我们的配方奶都喝光了 我总得想办法吧
And we ran out of formula, so we had to improvise.

909
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:54,436
你可以给我打电话呀 我可以买回来呀
You coulda called me. I would've brought you

910
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,054
或者也可以叫她出去
some formula. Or maybe she coulda went out

911
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:58,723
-买回来呀 -上帝没有创造配方奶
- and got some. - God didn't make formula,

912
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:00,809
维罗妮卡 上帝创造乳房是有原因的
Veronica. God made boobs for a reason.

913
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,979
嘿 发生什么事了 哦 我操 小凯

Know what? I think it's time for baby's nap.

919
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:18,326
是的 抱歉 那么再见吧
Okay, excuse me. Okay, bye-bye.

920
00:44:18,378 --> 00:44:20,579
你头发到底怎么回事 如果是因为有虱子
What happened to your hair? If it was lice again,

921
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:22,497
-我可以给你洗掉的 -不不 是因为太热了
- I could have washed it. - No, no, it was hot.

922
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:25,000
而且孩子们总是拉扯它们
And the kids were pulling on it.

923
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:29,337
可我喜欢你的长发 那 那他妈是我的长发 凯
I loved that hair. That-- that was my hair, Kev.

924
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:33,225
你 你怎么能这么做
I-- How could you do this?

925
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,926
他怎么能这么做
How could he do this?

926
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:38,346
小维 不过是头发而已 会长出来的
V, it's just hair. It'll grow back.

927
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:43,018
你不仅让一个妓女来母乳喂养我们的孩子 你还把头发剪了
You fed our baby hooker's milk and you shaved your head.

928
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,103
好了 行了 我们走吧 行吗 我们还是出发吧
Okay, okay, let's go, okay. We're just going to go.

929
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:46,738
我们去热舞 走吧 去酒吧嗨起来
Let's go dance. Come on, let's go to the bar.

930
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:49,858
你他妈都变成啥样了
Who the fuck are you?

931
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,194
这他妈只是个头型而已嘛
It's just a fucking haircut.

932
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:55,247
是啊你就继续这样认为吧 好了 我们走
Keep telling yourself that. Come on, let's go.

933
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:57,832
回见 小凯
See you, Kev.

934
00:44:57,868 --> 00:45:02,287
曼迪 你真是个美好的女孩
Mandy, you sweet, sweet girl.

935
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,339
但这样做会是罪过的
It's still a sin of the flesh.

936
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:07,709
但是上帝希望我能为你吹箫
But God wants my mouth on you.

937
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,795
他希望让你感受这份爱意
He wants you to feel his love through me.

938
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:14,049
闭上眼 牧师
Look away, Pastor.

939
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,052
我不想让你看见我做这种事
I don't want you to see me sinning.

940
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:19,221
我不想让你把我看低
I don't want you to think less of me.

941
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:23,391
但是曼迪 上帝赐予了你如此美貌
But God granted you such beauty, Mandy.

942
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:25,860
如果你不看的话
But if you don't watch,

943
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:28,396
我就可以把这看作是祈祷
then I can pretend I'm praying.

944
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:44,663
太棒了
Yes.

945
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:51,586
-射得真快啊 -什 这是什么意思
- Really fast. - What-- what is this?

946
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:57,175
-这张不错 -你们在做什么
- That's a good one. - What are you doing?

947
00:45:57,227 --> 00:45:59,594
哦 发推特和脸书呢
Oh, I'm Tweeting. Facebook too.

948

发了
And done.

949
00:46:01,098 --> 00:46:03,431
所以你要怎么对媒体解释呢 牧师
So what are you going to tell the press, Pastor?

950
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:05,016
说你以为为你口交的是一个
That you thought you were getting blown

951
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:07,269
-小女生吗 -哦
- by a teenage girl? - Oh.

952
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,988
-或是上帝本人呢 -哦我的天啊
- Or by God himself? - Oh, my God.

953
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:12,440
不过是个头型罢了 为什么每个人都反应这么大
It's just a haircut. Why is everyone freaking out?

954
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:15,243
不仅仅是头型 你 你看起来就像
It's not just a haircut. It's you-- you look like--

00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:19,247
-真的吗  -天啊
- You think? - That is not

958
00:46:19,283 --> 00:46:20,699
-这不是在赞美你 黛比  -这可是卡尔说的
- a compliment, Debbie. - From Carl?

959
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:22,284
-那就是赞美 -妓女很棒
- Totally is. - Hookers are hot.

960
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:23,702
-你听 -黛比
- See? - Debbie.

961
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:25,337
你是个聪明的女孩 你都在干些什么
You're a smart girl. What are you doing

962
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,422
-和妓女一起玩儿  -我怎么知道
- hanging out with whores? - I don't know.

963
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:30,342
你不也挺聪明的吗 那为什么还因为吸毒
You're a smart girl. Why are you on probation

964
00:46:30,377 --> 00:46:32,961
而坐过牢
for drugs?

965
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:50,195
你那两个朋友还没与你说话吗
Your friends still aren't talking to you?

966
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,696
什么朋友
What friends?

967
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:53,315
其实呢 你的发型
You know, your haircut

968
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:55,734
看上去确实挺不错的
actually looks pretty cute.

969
00:46:55,786 --> 00:46:57,235
但你必须把你的妆都给卸掉
But you're gonna have to take that makeup down

970
00:46:57,287 --> 00:46:58,453
至少得卸一半
by at least half.

971
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:00,655
好吧
Fine.

972
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:03,658
你现在打算干什么呢
What are you doing right now?

973
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,462
你想要和我一起去看乐队表演吗
You want to come and see a band with me?

974
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:08,496
好啊
Yeah.

975
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:19,758
你这澡洗得挺长的嘛
It was a long shower.

976
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,476
你是手淫去了吧
Oh, you pussied up.

977
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:25,180
这个嘛 与迈阿密的女友打了个性爱电话罢了
Yeah, well, might have been some phone sex with Miami.

978
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:29,401
你们这群人在那家前救护中心废墟上面修些什么呢
What are you guys building on top of the old nursing home?

979
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:31,853
我不修东西 我只是搬运
I don't build. I'm just demo.

980
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:33,271
我来告诉你那儿会修成什么
I'll tell you what it is.

981
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:36,024
我来告诉你们所有人
I'll tell you all what it is.

982
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,525
那儿要修一个星巴克
It's a Starbucks.

983
00:47:37,577 --> 00:47:40,362
或者其它什么手工饮料店
Or some sort of artisanal juicery.

984
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,197
要不就是什么食品店
Or a whole fucking foods.

985
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,832
别说了 弗兰克 好吗
Just drop it, Frank, all right?

986
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:45,750
我的朋友们 我这是在说他们要把这片区域高档化呢
I'm talking about gentrification, my friends.

987
00:47:45,786 --> 00:47:47,535
-高什么档 -我是在说
- Genital what? - I'm talking about

988
00:47:47,537 --> 00:47:49,788
从破败处逢生 我曾经见识过
the beginning of the end. I have seen this before

989
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,456
64年时的富尔顿街
on Fulton Street in '64.

990
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:53,208
还有68年时的卡比街
On Kirby Street in '68.

991
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,210
房地产经纪人用比市场价高的价格
Realtors started buying up property at better

992
00:47:55,212 --> 00:47:57,379
买下那些地 然后几个月时间内
than market value, and within a few months,

993
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,632
那些街区就焕然一新成为上流街区了
the whole neighborhood was over run with the gentry,

994
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:04,135
然后我们就会被赶走 如今 这些城市上流人员
and we were forced out. Today, the urban gentry

995
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:06,521
就是那些有钱的拉拉们 他们敲响你家的门
is monied lesbians. They knock on your door.

996
00:48:06,556 --> 00:48:08,473
提供你两倍于你家房产的价格
They offer you twice what your home is worth,

997
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:11,776
她们之所以这么做事因为她们知道行情内幕
and they do it 'cause they know something you don't.

998
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:13,061
他还真是说得头头是道
He like this at home?

999
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:14,562
怎么 你觉得我会让她们住进来吗
You think I'd let'em live in my home?

1000
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:20,068
笑吧 笑吧 一年后你们就笑不出来了
Laugh, laugh. You won't be laughing in a year.

1001
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,737
当你们负担不起这里的消费的时候 你们就笑不出来了
When you won't be able to afford to live here.

1002
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,406
她们搬进来 她们就会掌管这里
They move in, they take over.

1003
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:26,574
她们会将那些无家可归者赶出公园
They kick the homeless out of the park

1004
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:29,077
就好像那些无家可归者无权住在公园里一样
as if they don't have a God given right to sleep there.

1005
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,246
我们就像史前的恐龙 朋友们
We are dinosaurs, my friend.

1006
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:35,633
某颗巨大无比的彗星即将毁灭我们的家园
And a big, fat comet is headed for our sweet slice of earth.

1007
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:38,970
而那颗彗星 就是那家星巴克
And that comet is a Starbucks.

1008
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:43,758
他没要我出示身份证
Oh, he didn't card me.

1009
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,760
-我一定看上去很性感 -你确实如此
- I must look hot. - You do.

1010
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:48,930
我告诉过你的 你并不要打扮得像个妓女
And I told you, you don't need those whore shorts.

1011
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:50,315
来吧 嗨起来
Come on, let's dance.

1012
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:39,814
我尝试过了 萨米 我尝试过与你做朋友
I tried, Sammi. I've tried to be your friend.

1013
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:42,233
因为你是弗兰克的女儿
Because you're Frank's daughter,

1014
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:43,985
而弗兰克是我的丈夫
and Frank's my husband.

1015
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:47,822
但我今天认识到 我是你的继母
But I realized today, I'm your step-mother.

1016
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:50,825
所以为了能成为一个好继母
And so to be a good step-mother to you

1017
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:55,380
就必须做到一个母亲的责任 而不是像朋友那样
is to be a parent to you rather than a friend.

1018
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:58,383
所以 作为一个母亲 我有责任告诉你
So, as a parent, it's my responsibility

1019
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:02,053
为什么人们都不喜欢你
to tell you that the reason people don't like you,

1020
00:50:02,088 --> 00:50:05,673
为什么你父亲也不想待在你身边
and that your father doesn't want to be around you,

1021
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:11,646
是因为你真的 太贫穷 太懒惰了
is because you're very, very needy.

1022
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:14,015
我只是觉得你应该知道这一点
I just think you should know that,

1023
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:16,150
但你可以努力改善
and then you can work on it.

1024
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:20,021
你贫穷 懒惰 烦人
You're needy and annoying.

1025
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:26,828
还很骚 也不是个好母亲
And slutty, and a bad mother.

1026
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:30,782
我觉得这应该是查克的
I think this belongs to Chuckie.

1027
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,793
混蛋
Asshole.

1028
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:27,088
哦 糟糕 快走 黛比 快走
Aw, shit. Come on, Debs, let's go!

1029
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,097
-哦天啊 -你想以后再这么嗨
- Oh, my God. - You want to dress like that

1030
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:38,182
在酒吧里狂舞的话 你就得拥有快速逃跑的技能
and hang in bars, you gotta learn to run faster.

1031
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,768
刚才太疯狂了 我简直不敢相信你这么做了
That was insane, I can't believe you just did that.

1032
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:33,821
我的个操
Holy shit.

1033
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:37,375
他是怎么知道的
How'd he know?

1034
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,236
发生什么了
What's going on?

1035
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,548
告诉过了你们了
Told you.

1036
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:53,841
啦啦啦啦
Arr-ar-ar-aroooo!
