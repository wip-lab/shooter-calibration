第五季 第一集

11
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,190
我看到你的书了
I found your book.

12
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,470
如果我向别人坦白这一点
If I ever show it to anyone,

13
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,770
我将永远也走不进这个圈子
it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.

14
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,250
我肯定作品一旦发表  作者就会现身
I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward.

15
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,000
总会有一个人喜欢
There's a certain someone that might actually like

16
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,160
你描写她的方式  我说的不是瑟琳娜
the way she's painted, and I'm not talking about serena.

17
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,970
布莱尔  我们对外隐瞒我们的友谊
Blair, we kept us a secret

18
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,880
是因为我们害怕那感情已经超越了友谊
'cause we were afraid there was something more.

19
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,720
丹和我心灵相通
Dan and I have a real connection.

20
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,370
但那些都是路易王子来之前的事
That is, until a prince came along.

21
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,620
但我们的结合意味着我要和家族做对
Being together means going against my family,

22
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,150
如果我要表明立场
and if I'm going to take a stand,

23
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,840
我需要先确定你的感觉和我一样
I need to know for certain that you feel as I do.

24
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,990
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

25
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,500
你是查莉表妹吧
You are cousin Charlie?

26
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,100
等等  你没有信托基金吗
Well, wait. What about your trust fund?

27
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,100
为什么还没拿到
Why haven't you gotten it yet?

28
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,820
我不得不说这是个非常精明的计划
I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.

29
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,960
谢谢你  艾薇  你表现得很好
Thank you, Ivy. You played your part perfectly.

30
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,620
我们拥有的是伟大的爱
What we have is a great love.

31
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,200
不管我们之间争吵有多激烈
No matter what we do and how much we fight,

32
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,650
都只会拉近我们的距离
It'll always pull us in.

33
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,780
我要去和路易说分手了
I should find Louis and tell him it's over.

34
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,430
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

35
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,940
我要告诉你
When I need to tell you is--

36
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,900
她想告诉你的是  我祝福你们
What she's trying to say is, you have my blessing.

37
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,530
这是你获得幸福的好机会
This is your chance at happiness.

38
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,270
你值得拥有自己的童话
You deserve your fairy tale.

39
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,600
离开你
It's taking all the power I have

40
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,640
用尽了我所有的力气
to walk away from you.

41
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,040
但我必须放手让你走
But I need to let you go.

42
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,970
我需要独处
Being alone is just what I need.

43
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,790
没有男生  没有酒吧  只需要一瓶防晒霜
No boys, no bars. Just a bottle of sun block

44
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,660
和一些能在海边阅读的书
and a dozen of the best beach reads.

45
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,070
你要把《美丽与毁灭》改编成电影吗
Are you turning "The beautiful and damned" Into a movie?

46
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,940
我有主意了  我们已经有了美丽的和毁灭的
I got an idea. We got the beautiful and the damned.

47
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,790
现在这不是你的任务了
So this is not your assignment now.

48
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,410
我一直知道
I always know it's serious

49
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,970
连你都无法缓解的痛苦一定很严重
when even you know you can't dull the pain.

50
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,540
转下地球仪  选个地方
Just spin the globe and pick a point.

51
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,480
单身汉不需要对任何人负责
Bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.

52
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,750
怎么了
what is it?

53
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,110
天哪  这光线衬得你像天鹅一样美
God, you're such a swan in this light.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
停  完美  可以拷贝了
Cut! Perfect! Print.

55
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,520
我只想说一件事  你们表演得很棒
Okay, one thing I wanted to say. That was great.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,010
放松下来  尽量享受那过程
Loosen up. Enjoy it a little bit.

57
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,880
不要因为打着白领结
Just 'cause you're in white tie

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
就放不开  演不出放荡和酣醉的状态
doesn't mean you can't be dirty and drunk.

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,810
那时候的人就是这幅德行
That's how these people were back then.

60
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,510
懂我的意思吧  他们及时行乐
You know what I'm saying? They were having a good time.

61
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,740
所以别太僵硬  试着沉醉其中
So don't make it stiff. You know, enjoy it a little bit.

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,430
《纽约时报》打电话来
Uh, the "New York Times" called and wants a quote

63
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,630
他们想把这部电影时间设定在
on the decision to set the movie

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,390
1929年华尔街的股灾时期
on the days of the crash of '29.

65
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,770
但是我告诉过那个人
But I told that guy I don't wanna do that

66
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,880
除非我收到苏·左科尼的邮件才可以
unless I first get the e-mail from Sue Zucconi.

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
-好  -瑟琳娜  你好
- Okay. - Hi. Hey, serena. How are you?

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,620
你好  戴维  见到你很高兴
Good. How are you, David? Good to see you.

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,540
谢谢
Thanks.

70
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,600
没关系  我自己拿就好  你很忙
Oh, no, no. It's okay. I got it. You're busy.

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,270
你出来了  谁负责接制片办公室的电话
But then who would answer the phones in the production office?

72
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,810
我把电话呼叫转移到我手机上了
I had the calls forwarded to my cell.

73
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,700
如果你有空的话
Well, if you're hands-free,

74
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,160
最好去订正一下修正稿
all the better to collate the revisions

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
和制片组的草案
and the production team's drafts.

76
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,780
马歇尔  你不是说过
Marshall, remember when you said

77
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,470
在拍摄结束前  我可以来参观片场吗
that I could observe filming one day before the shoot was over?

78
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,160
拍摄要到下周才结束
Shoot's not over till next week.

79
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,570
瑟琳娜
Serena?

80
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,610
谢谢
Thank you.

81
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,200
路易王子和布莱尔小姐
将于2011年11月26日完婚
恭请光临

82
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,620
爸爸  你在这里干嘛
Dad! What are you doing here?

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
我以为你还在伦敦
I thought you'd still be in London,

84
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,550
你是来帮珍妮准备去圣马丁大学的事嘛
helping Jenny set up at Saint Martins.

85
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,600
我不知道萨拉·伯顿[设计师]是谁
Oh, she and Eric kicked me out

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,220
她和艾瑞克就把我赶出来了
when I didn't know who Sarah Burton was,

87
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,190
所以我就提前来这里
So I came back here early,

88
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,700
跟你待一段时间
and thought I'd spend some time with you.

89
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,680
很高兴你能来
Well, happy to have you.

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,750
我顺路去了茜茜那里  看到了这个
Yeah. I popped by Cece's. This was waiting.

91
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,300
也许这个很重要  是纽约那边寄来的
Maybe it's important. It's from the city.

92
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,870
这是布莱尔的婚礼请柬
It's, uh, Blair's "Save the date""

93
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,830
你不太开心啊  你们还是朋友吧
You're not happy. You guys are still friends, right?

94
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,260
是朋友
Yeah. Friends.

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
不知道她有没有邀请恰克
Wonder if she invited Chuck.

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,540
只要他在的地方能收到联邦快递
If he's anywhere that Fedex can reach...

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,900
你好  我们不认识吧
Hi. I don't believe we've met.

98
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,200
我是内特·阿齐布尔德
I'm Nate Archibald.

99
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,660
你们是
And, uh, you are?

100
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,950
等着我的美女
Waiting for me.

101
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,720
休息得如何
How was your nap?

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,420
挺好的  你不在
Great. You were gone.

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,250
恰克·拜斯收
内特尼尔·阿齐布尔德收

104
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,770
我才能睡好
It's the only time I can sleep.

105
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,300
为什么不找个人帮你改善改善睡眠
Why didn't you take someone with you for a change?

106
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,330
有我的信件吗
Anything for me?

107
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,440
没有
Nope.

108
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,830
如果你听到了一些疯狂的声音
Well, if you hear anything crazy,

109
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,200
那证明我在做很正点的事
it means I'm doing something right.

110
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,640
回家的感觉如何
How does it feel to be home?

111
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,340
从皇宫住回公寓
Oh, it's gonna be tough reacclimating,

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,780
重新适应环境有点难
after living in a palace, how will a penthouse do?

113
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,970
但也许我们应该把婚礼计划丢到一边
But maybe we should skip the wedding planning

114
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,860
拉上窗帘  在床上享受这一天
and pull the blinds and just spend the day in bed?

115
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,530
我们整个夏天都是那么过的
We did that all summer.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,450
我们不能再让父母等下去了
But we can't put off our parents any longer.

117
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,870
一件礼物能让你踏出闺房吗
Would a present help motivate you downstairs?

118
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,810
你怎么知道我就缺根这样的项链
How did you know just what I was missing? Oh!

119
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,290
我应该戴着它去听
Shall I wear it to your uncle's speech

120
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,740
你叔叔明天在联合国大会上的演讲吗
at the general assembly tomorrow?

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,760
不幸的是  除非你正式成为皇室成员
Unfortunately, you will not be allowed inside

122
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,760
否则是不能入场的
until you are an official member of the royal family.

123
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,330
你真的很幸运不用去听
Consider yourself lucky.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,930
艾伯特的演讲比安眠药还能催眠
Albert's speeches are stronger than Ambien.

125
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,200
我是觉得自己好幸运
I do consider myself lucky.

126
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,940
能生活在这样的童话世界里
I'm living a fairy tale.

127
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,140
但童话里的女主角都要克服艰难险阻
But no heroine gets her happy ending

128
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,200
才能得到幸福圆满的结局
without overcoming some obstacles,

129
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,290
这次的婚礼也不例外
and this wedding will be no exception.

130
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,760
一个全员大会加一个宗教仪式
A civil service and a religious ceremony?

131
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,990
这种事真是闻所未闻
Who has ever heard of such a thing?!

132
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,190
我们客人要坐在那里的时间
Our guests will be sitting

133
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,280
会比看场泰伦斯·马力克演的电影还长
longer than a Terrence Malick movie.

134
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,280
泰伦斯·马力克  美国电影导演

135
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,560
我是你坚强的后盾
I'm your rock.

136
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,370
一切有我在呢
You can count on me.

137
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,660
你们怎么来了这里
How did you guys end up here?

138
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,430
这是谁的船
And--and whose boat is this?

139
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,230
这是爱兰歌娜·范思哲的船
This is Allegra Versace's.

140
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,230
爱兰歌娜·范思哲  服装设计师范思哲的女儿

141
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,170
恰克在泰国清迈玩扑克比赛时赢得了它
Chuck won it in a poker game in Chiang Mai.

142
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,800
爱兰歌娜他也赢到手了  这是题外话了
He won Allegra, too, but, uh, that's another story.

143
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,630
那他现在没事了吗
Wow. So--so he's okay then?

144
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,280
你自己问他吧
Ask him yourself.

145
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,390
瑟琳娜
Serena.

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,900
你每次这么笑
Usually when you smile like this,

147
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,230
就像一只可怕的柴郡猫
you look like a creepy Cheshire cat,

148
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,910
不过你确实是开朗了不少
but this one is real.

149
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,370
你的秘决是什么  如果合法  我想学几招
What is your secret? And if it's legal, I want some.

150
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,790
这不是有形的  是种思想境界  一个词
It's not a substance. It's a state of mind. A word.

151
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,070
我来猜猜  一个下流的词
Well, let me guess-- a dirty word.

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,590
"是的"[一语双关]
"Yes""

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,580
真是个下流的词吗
Yes, it's a dirty word?

154
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,150
那个词是"是的"  可以用在各种情况下
The word is "Yes." I say it at anything.

155
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,940
机会出现了  我就抓住它
If an opportunity presents itself, I take it.

156
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,100
无论是什么我都会去尝试  包括幸福
There's nothing I won't try once, even happiness.

157
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,610
他很会鼓舞人心
Mm, he's very inspiring.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,710
我这一夏天都说他应该搞个教育宣传片
I've been saying all summer he should run an infomercial.

159
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,660
你是嘲讽  但若有人给我机会  我会说
You mock, but if someone gave me the opportunity, I'd say--

160
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,500
"好的"  是的  我明白
Yes. Yeah, I think I get it.

161
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,680
我觉得你没明白
I don't think you do.

162
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,300
你一夏天都
See, you've been working all summer

163
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,110
在做小助理的工作
in your little assistant's job,

164
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,560
推着小推车  端咖啡  整理东西
Driving a cart, getting coffee, sorting things.

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,470
就没有你更想做的事情吗
Isn't there something more you want out of it?

166
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,990
实际上  我崇拜的制片人简
Actually, the producer, Jane, who I really admire,

167
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,740
问了我关于一个场景的想法
asked me my thoughts on a scene.

168
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,710
我真的很兴奋  能写些建议方案
And I was really excited to write something up,

169
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,170
但是我的负责人  马歇尔
but then Marshall, who's technically my supervisor,

170
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,870
听到这个风声后
got wind of it and, uh...

171
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,660
对我的建议不感兴趣
He wasn't a huge fan of the idea.

172
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,780
什么  所以你没做吗
What, so you never did it?

173
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,790
没做  我向马歇尔妥协了
Well, no, I placated Marshall,

174
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,750
所以现在简大概觉得我只会夸夸其谈
so now Jane probably thinks I'm a flake.

175
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,230
还有机会的
There's still time.

176
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,470
你没有说"好的"  去跟她说"好的"
Go say the "Yes" you never said.

177
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,800
你知道吗  你说的没错
You know what? You--you are actually right.

178
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,980
即使你是在天马行空
And even if you are completely delusional,

179
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,810
还是显得你很在行  我明天就去找简
if it makes you look this good, I will find Jane tomorrow,

180
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,400
让马歇尔靠边站吧
Marshall be damned.

181
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,320
谁想跟我一起去
Who wants to go with me

182
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,200
确保我一定能做到
to make sure I actually go through with it?

183
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
我知道你们会说什么
I know what you're gonna say.

184
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
丹尼尔
Daniel.

185
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,050
我昨天还想起来你了呢  老伙计
Hey. I was thinking about you just yesterday, old boy.

186
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,020
我读了下期要发行的
Read an advanced copy

187
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,710
《名利场》里的一篇新小说样本
of a story that "Vanity Fair's" running in their next issue.

188
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,440
让我想起了你的工作
Reminded me of your work,

189
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,010
只是  你的文笔更出色
only... better.

190
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,720
谁写的
Who wrote it?

191
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,910
这是个问题  没人知道
That's the thing. No one knows.

192
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,470
完全是匿名的  大家都在谈论此事
Totally anonymous. And everyone's talking about it.

193
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,840
故事讲的什么内容
What's the story about?

194
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,500
关于沃顿商学院的事  还有很多沃尔夫的事
Ah, it's a little Wharton and a lot Wolfe.

195
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,510
陷阱曼哈顿上流社会伤风败俗的丑事
The modern mores and misdoings of upper crust Manhattan.

196
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,380
我想到了你  因为
I thought of you because

197
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,990
主角的名字竟然是狄伦·亨特
the protagonist's name was Dylan Hunter, of all things.

198
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,110
小说人物的原型就是...
The initials being what they are...

199
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
抱歉  耶利米  我得  我得走了
I'm sorry, Jeremiah. I gotta--I gotta run.

200
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,520
根据你的需求清单  布莱尔
I see from your list of demands, Blair...

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,470
需求清单
Demands?

202
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,070
你想要牡丹作为新娘手捧花
That you would like to have peonies in your bridal bouquet.

203
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,310
那是我最喜欢的花
They're my favorite flower.

204
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,590
它们非常漂亮  但是
And they are very beautiful, but...

205
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,200
在我们国家  新娘的手捧花是康乃馨
In our country, a bride always walks with carnations.

206
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,880
那就把它退给最近的花商并拿回退款吧
Hmm. To the nearest florist and demands a refund.

207
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,910
我要捧着牡丹花
I'll be holding peonies.

208
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,850
是吧  路易
Aren't I, Louis?

209
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,670
路易
Louis?

210
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,540
你美如天仙
With you looking so beautiful,

211
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,450
谁会在意你手里捧的是什么花
who will even notice the flowers?

212
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,940
《时尚巴黎》想为他们十一月期刊
Oh, "Vogue paris" would like to have a photo

213
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,000
拍张你穿婚纱的照片
of you in your wedding dress for their November issue.

214
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,680
很显然  这是一件很重大的盛事
Obviously, this is a very big deal as--

215
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
因为登上《时尚巴黎》杂志
as "Vogue paris" is perhaps

216
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,000
也许是世上最棒的事了
the best thing to happen to the world ever.

217
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,320
我知道这件事情很突然
Well, I know this is very short notice,

218
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,540
但别担心
but not to worry,

219
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,070
因为我的婚纱已经在用飞机送过来了
because my dress is already on the plane here.

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
你的婚纱
Your dress?

221
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,160
每个皇室女人都穿着这件婚纱结婚
Everybody has been married in this dress,

222
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,540
它从我的曾祖母开始传承下来
from my great-grandmother on down.

223
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,820
路易  我已经在食物  鲜花
Louis, I've already lost

224
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
还有洗礼盆上认输了
on the food, the flowers, and the font.

225
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,140
你知道婚纱由自己选对我有多重要
You know how important choosing my dress is for me.

226
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,890
但这是王室专属婚纱
But this is a dress for a royal.

227
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,940
你会喜欢妈妈的婚纱  我保证
You'll love mama's dress. I-I promise.

228
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,650
我迫不及待想看你穿上它的样子
I can't wait to see you in it.

229
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,190
来点冷普洛赛克[白葡萄酒]来缓解伤痛吗
How about some cold prosecco to kill the pain?

230
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,310
最新消息
This just in.

有人在第五大道的垃圾箱内的新发现
outside a well-known fifth avenue prewar,

233
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,280
很明显某个我们爱戴的知名人士怀孕了
it appears someone we know and love is in the family way.

234
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,620
你们虔诚的八卦天后
So this is your humble gossip girl

235
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,840
现在要发出一则孕妇通缉启事

236
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,500
下一位丑闻对象会是哪位未婚先孕的少女呢
Who could the mother of our next scandal be?

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,700
怎么了  多洛塔
What's wrong, Dorota?

238
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,140
没事  没怎么
Nothing. Uh, nothing at all.

239
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,150
删除信息

240
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,540
普罗赛克
Prosecco?

241
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,620
我觉得我该把我的精力放在下一轮上
I think I need all my wits for the next round.

243
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,620
不用了
Oh, no, it's okay.

244
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,560
我这个夏天一开始就戒酒了
I gave up drinking at the beginning of summer.

245
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,520
这是洛杉矶的生活方式
You know, L.A. lifestyle.

246
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,190
继续吧  你们俩该喝一杯
Come on. You guys need one.

247
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,260
干杯
Cheers.

248
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,760
至少这个秘密马上就要不攻自现了
At least this secret is bound to show itself soon.

249
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,150
第一次会面就是个悲剧
The first meeting was a disaster, S.

250
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,030
他对索菲唯命是从
He conceded to Sophie on everything.

251
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,460
事情完全在我控制之外
Oh, it was so out of control,

252
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,020
他就像个意大利人一样
you would've thought he was Italian.

253
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,880
在母亲和未婚妻中间找到平衡点
Well, finding a balance between your mother and your fiancee

254
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,660
是很难的
has gotta be tough.

255
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,400
我敢肯定他在尽可能地维持和平关系
I'm sure he's just trying to keep the peace the best he can.

256
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,570
别那么理性  你不能只考虑一方面啊
Stop being so rational and trying to see both sides.

257
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,600
我还没说到最糟糕的地方呢
I haven't even told you the worst part yet.

258
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,360
他们想让我穿索菲的婚纱
They want me to wear Sophie's dress.

259
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,810
不仅仅是在婚礼那天
Not just on the day,

260
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,910
拍《时尚巴黎》时也要穿
but in "Vogue Paris", too.

261
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,330
他们把我当成慈善组织施舍的对象
Hand-me-downs are for charity and second children,

262
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,520
而不是婚礼当天的新娘
not for the bride on her wedding day.

263
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,680
路易知道我有多不开心
Louis knows how upset I am.

264
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,300
他答应会和索菲谈  但我不知他是否真的会
He said he'd talk to Sophie, but... I don't know.

265
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,550
B  首先  能上《时尚巴黎》非常棒
B., first of all, "Vogue paris"--that's amazing!

266
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,550
无论你穿什么都会很漂亮的
And you're gonna look beautiful in whatever you wear,

267
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,390
你该穿上索菲的婚纱
which should be Sophie's gown.

268
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,460
那样的话  她将看到你在照片上高贵的一面
That way, she has a gorgeous photo of you

269
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,040
和她想像的一样
looking exactly how she wants,

270
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,490
那样你就有更大胜算
and that way you have more leverage

271
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,140
在婚礼那天穿自己的婚纱了
to wear your own dress on the real day.

272
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,380
看  这就是为什么我希望你在我身边
See, this is why I wish you were here.

273
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,530
你那边还没忙完吗
Aren't you done out there?

274
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,520
洛杉矶只是去做休憩时的停靠站
Los Angeles is a plastic surgery layover,

275
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,930
不是久居的地方
not somewhere you live.

276
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,100
瑟琳娜  你的客人刚刚进来
Serena, your guests just came through the gate.

277
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,590
好的谢谢  我马上过去
Okay, thank you. I'll be right there.

278
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,540
B  我也爱你也很想你
B., I love you and I miss you, too.

279
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,410
好吧  明天同一时间
All right. Tomorrow, same time?

280
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,190
我们今天聊了我  明天说说你的事吧
Today we did me, so we can do you?

281
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,060
没问题  我把你排在日程表里了
Of course. You're on my schedule.

282
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,530
快听听  好专业啊
Aw. Listen to you, all professional.

283
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,840
再见
Bye.

284
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,580
布莱尔小姐  你最近有看《八卦天后》吗
Miss Blair, have you seen "Gossip girl" Lately?

285
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,630
没看
No.

286
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,240
我们应该讨论下有一件事
We need to discuss something...

287
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,460
一件会影响到我们俩未来的事情
something affecting both our futures.

288
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,440
唯一会影响到我们俩未来的就是
The only thing affecting our futures

289
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,720
你收拾桌子的速度还不够快
is your inability to clear a table fast enough.

290
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,230
看来路易跟索菲谈过了
It appears that Louis has spoken to Sophie.

291
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,450
我要打扮漂亮些去接受皇室的致歉
I need to look my best for my first royal apology.

292
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,510
-给你  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

293
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,480
能帮我跟简说下我想跟她谈谈吗
And do you mind telling Jane that I need to talk to her?

294
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,390
我知道她们在吃午饭
I know they're on lunch.

295
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,140
没问题
Sure.

296
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,360
我不记得有允许你的朋友来探班
I don't remember approving a set visit for your friends.

297
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,470
你一定就是马歇尔
You must be Marshall.

298
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,350
您是哪位
And who are you?

299
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,860
他是恰克·拜斯
He's Chuck Bass.

300
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,720
特技演员准备好跳了
Hey, so the stuntman's prepped for the fall.

301
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,860
你能让戴维来见下我
Can you, uh, ask David to meet me by the bag

302
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,910
谈谈替身的问题吗
to talk to the double?

303
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,270
特技是什么
What's the stunt?

304
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
我可以带你去看看
I could show you.

305
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,090
你们知道我会说什么
You know what I have to say.

306
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,170
那就去吧
Then go.

307
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,310
我要去找戴维了  我会跟简说你来过
I have to find David. I'll tell Jane you stopped by.

308
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,600
去工作吧
Get back to work.

309
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,950
虽然我们不在纽约
Well, the zip codes may be different,

310
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,000
但讨厌鬼在哪里都有
but douche bags are the same no matter where you go.

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,440
现在他走了  去找简吧
But now he's gone. Go find Jane.

312
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,700
你想做什么呢
Okay, what are you gonna do?

313
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,000
S  这位是我的中午试镜演员吗
Hey, S. Is this my noon audition?

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,350
-没错  -等等
- Yes. - Wait.

315
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,910
你在开玩笑吗  你是在开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me? You're kidding me.

316
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,170
你会做得很棒的
You're gonna be great.

317
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,140
是的  我扛得住
Yeah, I'll totally hold.

318
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,270
谢谢  埃普莉
Thanks, Epperly.

319
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,890
我不懂  为什么瓦内萨要偷你的小说呢
I don't get it. Why would Vanessa steal your story?

320
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,330
为了教训我
Oh, to teach me a lesson.

321
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,330
希望她没偷
Let's just, uh, hope I'm wrong,

322
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,450
但是
which...

323
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,740
她确实偷了
I'm not.

324
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,340
加百莉亚给你回话了吗
Did Gabriela ever call you back?

325
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
你觉得珍妮可能会有瓦内萨的消息吗
You think maybe Jenny's heard from Vanessa?

326
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,910
她为什么会找珍妮呢
Why would she call Jenny?

327
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,300
对  对  我在听
Yeah, yeah, I'm--I'm here.

328
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,450
好吧
Okay.

329
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,930
谢谢
Thank you.

330
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,110
埃普莉在《名利场》的朋友
Epperly's friend at "Vanity Fair"

331
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,870
说他只知道格雷顿·卡特读了那小说
says all he knows is Graydon Carter read the story

332
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,050
然后决定出版
and decided to run it.

333
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,320
那很好呀  对吧
Oh, that's pretty cool, right?

334
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,180
《名利场》要出版你的作品了
I mean, "Vanity fair"'s gonna publish your writing?

335
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,980
他们这么做不是因为我的作品
If only they were doing it because of my writing.

336
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,200
这么做是因为他们认为那小说写的是一位名流
I mean, they--they think it's about a celebrity.

337
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,880
真的吗  怎么说
Really? Why?

338
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,740
因为小说人物有点像的名流是
Oh, because it's about a celebrity, kind of.

339
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,730
布莱尔·霍道夫  未来的摩洛哥王妃
Uh, Blair Waldorf, future princess of Monaco.

340
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,430
我是今年春天时写的  在她跟我
I wrote it in the spring, after she and I...

341
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,970
怎么
What?

342
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,570
你要去哪
Where you going?

343
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,790
去找唯一一个
To find the one person

344
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,770
能帮我阻止这一切发生的人
what can help me stop this before it's too late.

345
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,510
好吧  我接受
It's okay. I accept.

346
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,360
接受什么
Accept what?

347
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,570
你的道歉
Your apology.

348
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,220
你没跟你妈妈说
You didn't talk to your mother.

349
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,120
我真的很难拒绝她的要求
It's just so hard to say no to her.

350
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,530
如果现在不能顺从她的话
I worry she'll make things more difficult later

351
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,370
我担心她之后会弄出更多麻烦
if she doesn't get her way right now.

352
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,210
我只是在缓和她对于我们未来的威胁
I'm trying to ease her into our future.

353
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,100
未来就是现在了
The future is here.

354
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,340
我们再过三个月就结婚了
We're gonna be married in three months.

355
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,220
我必须得确定我们站在同一条战线上
I need to know that we're in this together,

356
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,550
我不是一个人孤军奋战
and I'm not just standing here alone.

357
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,980
当然不是  我就在这
You're not. I'm right here.

358
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,530
不是说说就罢了
Those are just words.

359
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,130
我需要你用行动证明
I need proof.

360
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,530
我明白
You're right.

361
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,910
礼服的事儿明天再说
The dress discussion can wait until tomorrow.

362
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,690
今晚我要让我妈知道  你最重要
But tonight, I show my mother that you come first.

363
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,080
6点钟准备好
Be ready at 6:00.

364
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,640
准备做什么
Ready for what?

365
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,170
我要带你一同前往联合国大会
You will be on my arm at the general assembly gala.

366
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,830
不是规定我去不了吗
I thought there was a rule.

367
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,390
今晚我要打破那个规定
It's about to be broken.

368
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,790
你觉得如何
What do you say?

369
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,970
这里不对  这两面墙应该是白色的
This isn't right. These two walls need to be white.

370
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,500
瑟琳娜  你来找马歇尔吗
Serena. Are you looking for Marshall?

371
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,990
不  我是来找你的
No. You, actually.

372
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,900
你不会是来跟我解释
I hope it's to tell me

373
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,290
我们第一次会议后  你没有跟进的原因吧
why you didn't follow up after our first meeting.

374
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,790
我不是给你吓跑了吧
I didn't scare you away, did I?

375
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,720
不不不  完全不是
No. No, no, no. Not at all.

376
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,450
我只是不想伤马歇尔的感情
I just didn't want to step on Marshall's toes.

377
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,600
可戴维雇用你就是为了跟进他们的工作
Why not? Keeping on them is what David hired you to do.

378
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,780
如果不是因为你
If it weren't for you,

379
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,400
他根本不会看那本书
he wouldn't have even read the book.

380
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,130
正是因为他做出书和剧本的细致对比
And it was his thoughtful comparison of the book to the script

381
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,510
才让各部门步调一致
that's helped keep all of the departments focused.

382
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,720
但是那个对比在第一周我就做过了
But I-I did that the first week.

383
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,810
如果我早知道他也在做  我就...
If I would've known he was doing it, too, I...

384
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,180
我不是想给别人添麻烦
I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble.

385
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,270
请不要
Please don't...

386
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,530
没什么麻烦
No one's in trouble.

387
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,200
揭示那些被该被知会的事没什么不好
A little reminder that things don't go unnoticed never hurts.

388
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,890
谁会觉得有责任感不好呢
What would you say to a little more responsibility,

389
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,760
看你的表现了
See how you do with it?

390
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,270
我只能说
I'd say...

391
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,590
没问题
Yes.

392
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,070
简刚打来电话  让我今天休息
Jane just called, gave me the rest of the day off.

393
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,280
她说我做事做得太慢
Said I was taking too long to finish her task list

394
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,810
让我把剩下的工作交给你
and that I should leave the rest to you.

395
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,170
跟我听说的一样  这些事情对瑟琳娜来说
Looks like things really do come easy to Serena Van der Woodsen,

396
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,450
简直是易如反掌
just like I heard.

397
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,610
但如果你把我的工作做得比我更好
But if you think you can do my job better than I can,

398
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,980
那你就试试看吧
here's the test.

399
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,340
明日任务
"Pull tomorrow's sides,

400
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,700
更新通讯录 带狗狗去美容院
"update phone sheet, take dogs to groomer,

401
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,390
写尤金尼德斯的报道
write coverage of Eugenides."

402
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,000
也不是什么艰巨的任务  多长时间之内完成
This isn't so bad. How long did she give you to do this?

403
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,080
明天
Till tomorrow.

404
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,320
好的  派对之前我就能搞定
Okay, well, I'll have it done by the party later.

405
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,010
我并不希望在派对上看到你
Well, I hope I don't see you there.

406
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,610
我会去的  等等  你看到我的朋友们了吗
Oh, you will. Wait. Have you seen my friends?

407
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,160
从那里跳下来
Hey, get down from there!

408
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,350
你们  你们
Guys. Guys. G--

409
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,050
你麻烦大了
You're about to be in a lot of trouble,

410
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,490
我怎么觉得你满不在乎啊
but I get the feeling you don't care.

411
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,340
你今晚有空吗
You free tonight?

412
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,250
我现在有空
I am now.

413
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,610
对了  我忘记问你  试镜怎么样
Oh! I forgot to ask you. How was the audition?

414
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,740
当我告诉他们  我不是演员之后
Well, after I told them I wasn't an actor,

415
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,690
他们说  真是太遗憾了  你太适合
They said, "That's too bad, because you'd be perfect

416
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,680
演一个东海岸政治家族的孩子
as a kid from an east coast political family

417
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
那种总是被家族操控
who's constantly manipulated

418
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,670
同时还努力地让身边的朋友都开心的人
while trying to keep everyone around him happy."

419
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,870
他们就是这样跟我说的
They told me that.

420
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,740
你应该说  "是的"  我说真的
You should've said, "Yes!" I mean it.

421
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,000
如果是上奥普拉脱口秀的话  她会更清楚的
If there was still in Oprah, she would've been all over that.

422
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,270
我喜欢盖尔[同为脱口秀主持人]
Oh, I like Gayle.

423
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,750
我也是
Me, too.

424
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,680
还有  谢谢你让我用你的卡
So by the way, thank you for letting me use your card.

425
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
如果不是你来了
If you hadn't been here,

426
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,920
我都不知道我怎么完成这个任务
I don't know how I would've gotten this task done--

427
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,510
而马歇尔恰恰不想让我顺利完成
which I'm sure was Marshall's intention.

428
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,790
我越来越喜欢加州的法则
Hey, gotta love California's laws.

429
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,420
还有
Oh, by the way,

430
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,150
帕瑞克·罗伯茨是有青光眼还是什么病
does Patrick Roberts have glaucoma or something?

431
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,910
比如  有点紧张抽搐症之类的
Like a--like a little nervous twitch?

432
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,730
谁知道呢  任务单上的最后一项
Who knows? It was the last thing on the list.

433
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,780
准备好帕瑞克的大麻
"Get Patrick his medicinal weed."

434
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,210
我不知道他会喜欢哪种
I wonder which one he'll want--

435
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,330
"蓝莓头手"
Blueberry headband,

436
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,740
"少林龙" 还是"周五寿司"
Dragon of shaolin, or sushi Friday?

437
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,000
"头手"不错
Headband's pretty good...

438
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,400
这是我听说来的
From what I've heard from people telling me that it's good.

439
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,400
没什么意思  我只是好奇你怎么会需要那个
No, no judgment. I'm just curious why you need it.

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,180
坐在游艇里巡航没什么可紧张的吧
It's not like cruising around on a yacht is stressful.

441
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,530
不是紧张  但是成天无所事事
Uh, no, I know that, okay? But doing nothing

442
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,030
给了我足够的思考时间
has given me a lot of time to think, you know?

443
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,910
也许是旧事的影响
And maybe the last couple years are starting to take their toll on me,

444
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,430
我的家庭  茱丽叶
between my family, Juliet...

445
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
瑞娜  还有你
Raina, you.

446
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,310
有时候  我真希望可以改头换面重新做人
I mean, sometimes I wish I could just reinvent myself, you know?

447
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,400
那你真的来对地方了
Well, you've come to the right place.

448
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,770
在好莱坞的每个人都重新做人了
Everyone in Hollywood reinvents themselves.

449
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,760
比如说我
I mean, look at me.

450
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,040
离家短短三千英里
I have gone from "It" Girl to working girl

451
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,240
我就从物质女变成工作女
in just 3,000 miles.

452
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,960
真是让我大吃一惊
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

453
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,360
听着  如果你厌倦了做自己
Look, if you're sick of being you,

454
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,930
就换个角色
be someone else for a while.

455
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,500
那你说我该去哪里换个角色呢
Yeah, and just where do you suppose that I do that?

456
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,170
今晚的派对就是一个很好的机会
At the party we earned our way into tonight.

457
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,750
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

458
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,140
天啊  你看起来真可爱
My, don't you look lovely!

459
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,080
布莱尔小姐要去联合国
Miss Blair go to U.N.

460
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,480
和路易还有王妃一起
With Louis and the princess?

461
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,240
我觉得不太合适
I-I-I thought it wasn't proper.

462
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,140
本来就是  布莱尔小姐是在试探王子
It isn't. Miss Blair testing prince.

463
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,020
路易跟我说  他今晚会跟他妈妈摊牌
Louis told me he would stand up to his mother tonight.

464
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,560
如果他做到了  那一切就按计划行事
So if he does, everything can continue the way it's meant to.

465
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,390
如果他做不到  那就让他们娘俩
And if he doesn't, he and his mother will have

466
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,550
11月举办一场没有新娘的美好婚礼吧
a lovely wedding in November without a bride.

467
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,170
或者她可以直接取代我的位置
Or she could just take my place,

468
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,950
她似乎对此求之不得
which seems to be what she wants.

469
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,740
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

470
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,060
亲爱的  是不是婚礼给你的压力太大了
Darling, is the stress of the wedding getting to you?

471
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,560
刻意考验一个爱你的好男人通常没有好结果
Testing a good man who loves you never ends well.

472
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,820
妈妈  我没有任何压力
Nothing is getting to me, mother.

473
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,460
我是霍道夫家的女人
I am a Waldorf woman.

474
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,320
我需要掌握话语权
I need to know I still have a voice

475
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,970
同时保证我的话不会被忽视
and that voice is heard.

476
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,580
我现在要下楼等路易了
Now I'm gonna go wait for Louis downstairs.

477
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,760
我发誓
I swear,

478
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,280
有时候  我真不知道她这脾气哪来的
sometimes I don't know where she gets it from.

479
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,340
路易
Louis.

480
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,930
丹
Dan.

481
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,730
我真的需要你的帮助
Hey. Uh, listen, I-I really need your help.

482
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,960
我写的一个故事
I wrote a story

483
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,760
就要在一本杂志的下一期发表了
that this magazine is publishing in their next issue,

484
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,810
但其实我根本不想它发表
and I really don't want them to.

485
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,120
可我没办法阻止他们
I have no idea how to stop it,

486
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,140
但我想
but I-I figured, you know,

487
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,910
如果你用你的皇室身份给他们施压
if you put your royal weight behind it,

488
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,140
这事大概一个小时就能解决
it could be dead in an hour.

489
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,430
对不起  我还有个宴会  马上要迟到了
I'm sorry. I have an event I'm late for.

490
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,130
-布莱尔  -布莱尔就是这故事的主角
- Blair is-- - Blair is the one the story's about.

491
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,940
我向你保证  一旦这个故事见了天日
I swear to you, if this story ever sees the light of day,

492
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,430
你一定会很不开心的
you are not gonna be happy.

493
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,580
准备好出发了吗
You ready to go?

494
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,090
你短信上不是说  要带一个朋友来吗
I thought your text said you were bringing a friend.

495
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,600
玛丽卢和帕特里克·罗伯茨一起走了
Oh, Marilu got a ride with Patrick Roberts.

496
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,430
她跟他寸步不离
She goes wherever he goes anyway.

497
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,810
为什么  他们在一起了吗
Why? Are they together?

498
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,900
不是  她是保险公司派来的行为监督人
No, she's his minder from the bond company.

499
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,110
他必须时刻保持清醒  否则电影就泡汤了
He has to stay sober, or the film gets shut down.

500
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,510
幸运的是  你跟我不需要
Luckily, you and I don't.

501
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,460
你不用戴那个头盔了  我开了卡车过来
But you won't be needing that helmet. I brought my truck.

502
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,950
在穆赫兰道骑车相当危险
Riding Mulholland can be pretty dangerous,

503
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,670
而且派对就在那里举行
and that's where the party is.

504
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,070
那我把这个放进去
Well, I'll throw this inside.

505
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,820
查尔斯·拜斯先生亲启

506
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,790
石头棍棒也许只会让你伤筋断骨
Stick and stones may just break bones,

507
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,110
但言语带来的伤痕却永远无法愈合
but the wounds from words never heal...

508
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,260
尤其是那些我们希望从没看见过的言语
Especially when they're words we hoped we'd never read.

509
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,830
转念一想
On second thought,

510
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,310
我可以小心点骑
I'm sure I could ride carefully.

511
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,610
不会有那么危险  是吧
Nothing's that dangerous, right?

512
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,230
给你
Here you go.

513
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,390
你不可能
Oh, you can't possibly--

514
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,520
都搞定  可她就是做到了
have finished? She did.

515
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,930
所有事
Everything?

516
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,380
严格来说  还差一件事
Well, technically, there's still one thing left.

517
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,840
你看见帕特里克了吗
Have you see Patrick?

518
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,680
他在外面泳池边
Yeah, outside by the pool.

519
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,290
你的机会来了
This is your chance.

520
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,480
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

521
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,830
别装蒜了  你横跨整个美国
Come on. You're at a party

522
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,920
来参加一个不属于你生活圈子的派对
all the way across the country from your real life,

523
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,770
这里根本没人认识你
where no one knows your name.

524
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,690
你想扮成谁
Who do you wanna be?

525
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,680
不要  我不认为这样有用
No. No, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. All right?

526
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,250
天啊  你是那个  你是电影里那个谁吗
Oh, my God. Are you that guy-- that guy from that movie?

527
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,150
没错
Uh... yes.

528
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,220
我爱死他了  能给我们签个名吗
I love that guy. Can we have your autograph?

529
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,170
没问题
Yeah.

530
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,140
-你住在洛杉矶吗  -是的
- Do you live in L.A.? - Yes.

531
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,100
-车道上停的迈巴赫是你的吗  -是的
- Is that your Maybach in the driveway? - Yeah.

532
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,370
-这是你的房子吗  -是的
- This is your house? - Yes.

533
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,060
带我参观一下怎么样
How about a tour?

534
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,440
好的  当然没问题
Yes. Absolutely.

535
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,130
这是私人之旅
Uh, this is a private tour.

536
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,270
我的神啊
My, my.

537
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,990
这不是纽约一姐吗
If it isn't New York's finest.

538
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,830
难得见你出来一次
Nice to see you out and about for once.

539
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,550
帕特里克  谢谢  出来感觉很好
Thanks, Patrick. It's good to be out.

540
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,530
嘿  我有东西要给你
Hey, I, um, have something for you.

541
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,400
你要干什么
What are you doing?

542
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,670
制片人让我送来的
Production sent me for it.

543
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,410
太棒了
Well, that is awesome.

544
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,000
玛丽卢说这个没事吗
Marilu said it was cool?

545
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,540
我想是吧
Well, I-I guess.

546
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,250
玩的开心吗
Have fun?

547
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
马上就开心了
I will now.

548
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,780
路易来电

549
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,660
真不敢相信  我居然接了这个电话
I can't even believe I'm answering this call.

550
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,060
布莱尔  对不起  突然有事
I'm so sorry, Blair. Something's come up

551
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,970
让我耽搁了
that's taking me longer than anticipated.

552
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,930
现在看来我可能去不了大会了
Now it looks like I won't make it to the gala at all.

553
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,980
你就这样搪塞我吗
You're going with "vague" on this one?

554
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,460
"突然有事"
"Something's come up"?

555
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,860
你怎么不干脆承认
Why don't you just admit that

556
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,630
你跟你妈一起去了联合国总部
you're already in the U.N. with your mother

557
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,340
别撒谎行吗
instead of lying?

558
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,650
我没有  我也想告诉你我在哪
I'm not. I wish I could tell you where I am,

559
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,100
但我承诺过要保密
but I made a promise.

560
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,060
大家都清楚你的承诺有多金贵
And we know how you honor the promises you make,

561
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,930
只有对我不是
as long as they're not to me.

562
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,150
跟你妈道喜吧  她赢了
Tell your mother congratulations. She won.

563
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,820
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

564
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,640
给吉米打电话  让他帮我叫辆出租
Call down to Jimmy and tell him to get me a cab.

565
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,970
你要去哪
Where are you going?

566
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,830
-你喜欢收藏吗  -是的
- Do you collect? - Yes.

567
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,660
这是赫尔穆特·纽顿的作品  对吗
A Helmut Newton, right?

568
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,390
对  是的
Yes.

569
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,260
那幅是劳伦·赫顿的吗
Is that Lauren Hutton?

570
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,110
是的
Yes.

571
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,000
还是丽莎·泰勒的
Or is it Lisa Taylor?

572
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,480
是的  你怎么知道的
Yes. How'd you know?

573
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,130
因为我眼尖儿
Mm, I have a good eye...

574
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,550
品位还高
and good taste.

575
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,500
这是主卧吗
Is this the master bedroom?

576
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,260
我们来搞破坏吧
Let's destroy it.

577
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,560
配乐进行的如何了
How is the score going?

578
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,140
主旋律基本快完成了
Uh, well, we've almost finished the key theme.

579
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,740
我们还在听伦纳德·科恩的配乐
And we've been listening to that Leonard Cohen score

580
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,110
想从他给《花村》的配乐中获取灵感
that he did for "Mccabe & Mrs. Miller" for inspiration.

581
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,530
不好意思  我得离开一下
I'm sorry. Would you two excuse me just for a minute?

582
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,400
有什么事吗
Is everything okay?

583
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,100
马歇尔刚刚告诉我
Marshall just informed me

584
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,510
他发现帕特里克身上有大麻
that he found Patrick with some pot,

585
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,730
幸运的是  马歇尔已经在
which luckily he was able to confiscate

586
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,350
他铸成大错之前截下了大麻
before disaster struck.

587
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,110
铸成大错
Disaster?

588
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,060
玛丽卢是保险公司的
Marilu's from the insurance company.

589
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,590
帕特里克必须保持清醒
The movie only keeps its completion bond

590
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,150
制片方才能得到"完工保证"[保险公司出具]
if Patrick stays sober.

591
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,370
如果她发现  他再次嗑药的话
If she found out he broke his sobriety,

592
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,970
她就会叫停电影拍摄
she'd have to shut the movie down.

593
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
我真不知道  他是怎么拿到那些东西的
I can't imagine how he got his hands on it.

594
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,000
我去找帕特里克  相信他能给我们答案
Well, I'm gonna go get Patrick. He'll tell us.

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,410
他肯定会为他差点酿成的大祸疯掉的
He is scared out of mind at what he almost did.

596
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,730
抱歉
Excuse me.

597
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,110
谢天谢地  我正...
Oh, thank god. I was...

598
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,100
布莱尔
Blair?

599
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,300
你过来有什么事吗  路易有没有
Hey, what are you doing here? Did Louis, uh...

600
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,310
我不知道还有什么地方可以去
Uh, I didn't know where else to go.

601
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,140
我本来不想来这
I wasn't gonna come here.

602
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,100
整个夏天  我都没和你联系
I hadn't talked to you all summer, and...

603
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,270
可你是我认识的人里  唯一一个还在纽约的
you're the only person I know in New York right now,

604
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,490
而我现在  真的很需要一个朋友
and I really need a friend,

605
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,790
如果你还是的话
if you're still...

606
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,850
我当然还是你的朋友  发生什么事了
Of course I am. What's going on?

607
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,280
我要取消我的订婚
I am about to call off my engagement.

608
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,370
我不能和一个
I can't marry someone

609
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,280
在他妈妈面前都不能维护我的人结婚
who doesn't stand up for me, not even to his own mother.

610
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,160
当我告诉他  我们结束了的时候
And... when I tell him it's over,

611
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,400
我需要逃离片刻  让自己清醒一下
I'll need to get away, to clear my head.

612
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,070
你之前是在汉普顿吗
You were in the Hamptons?

613
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,570
在阿默甘西特  茜茜那里
Uh, Amagansett. Cece's house.

614
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,930
那现在没人吧
Is it empty?

615
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,710
带我过去
Take me there.

616
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,550
好
Okay.

617
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,640
我们  我们可以开我爸的车去
Uh, we can, uh, we can take my dad's car.

618
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,340
到了那  你再和路易联系
You'll call Louis from there.

619
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,200
无论你需要什么
I'll be there with you,

620
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,090
我都在你身边陪着你
for whatever you need.

621
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,120
通常来说  寻找新路径是为了
Often, all it takes to find a new path

622
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,690
让局面突然扭转  看看你到底得到了什么
is to make a sharp turn and see what you find.

623
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,200
从这开始你得小心点
You gotta take it easy up here.

624
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,260
有些歌里都写到  在洛杉矶的道路上翻车
People write songs about wiping out on our L.A. roadways.

625
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,730
我一点都不怕
I'm not scared.

626
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,100
你应该害怕
Well, you should be.

627
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,790
我什么都不怕
I'm not scared of anything.

628
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,130
小心点
But beware.

629
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,490
有些时候你所面对的  可是死路一条
Sometimes what you're faced with is a dead end.

630
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,350
老天哪  你没事吧
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

631
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,060
我好得很  你看我流血没
I'm perfect. You see any blood anywhere?

632
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,780
但我需要一杯苏格兰威士忌
I could use a glass of Scotch, however.

633
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,180
我们是走回去  还是我开你的车载你回去呢
Should we walk or should I drive you on yours?

634
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,610
好吧  我知道  我一点都不了解你
Okay, I know I don't know you at all,

635
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,640
但是我希望  我接下来的话你能听进去
and you probably could give a damn about what I have to say.

636
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,620
大多数人来我这里
Most of the people in my business are in it

637
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,100
是因为  他们热衷于寻求刺激
because they're thrill-seekers or adrenaline junkies.

638
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,740
但还有其他一些人
But for some of them,

639
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,560
有着更阴暗的原因
there's something darker going on.

640
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,920
我觉得你需要帮助
I think you need help.

641
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,110
我说了我好得很
I said I'm fine.

642
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,510
好吧  可能是  但是
Well, that may be, but...

643
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,970
这次约会结束了
this date is over.

644
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,810
祝你好运 恰克
Good luck, Chuck.

645
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,800
谢谢
Thank you.

646
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,800
我的好朋友说的是对的
My best friend was right.

647
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
说"是的"让一切都好多了
Saying "Yes" makes everything better.

648
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,680
根据我最近的经验  我非常赞同
Well, based on my own recent experience, I've have to agree.

649
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,220
现在你得走了
Now it's time for you to leave.

650
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,800
如果你希望我走  那没问题
Well, if that's how you want to be about it, okay.

651
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,610
但是  这是我家
But it is my house.

652
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,660
你不认为  你是该走的那个吗
Don't you think you should be the one to go?

653
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,410
事实上  这是我家
Actually, this is my house.

654
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,650
现在可以告诉你了  这不是主卧
And just so you know, this isn't the master bedroom.

655
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,910
这是客房  最小的一间客房
It's a guest room-- the smallest one.

656
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,970
很高兴见到你  你叫
Nice to meet you, by the way, um...

657
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,510
内特
Nate.

658
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,890
很棒的名字
Mm. That's a great name.

659
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,870
你叫什么呢
Uh, and you are?

660
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,970
谈话结束
Done now.

661
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,070
你怎么能这样对我
How could you do this to me?

662
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,860
你以为我不知道  你打的是什么主意吗
You think I didn't know what you were up to?

663
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,830
你是想告诉我  规规矩矩地完成简布置的任务
Try to tell me that doing everything on Jane's list

664
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,310
并不能让我崭露头角
wasn't just to show me up.

665
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,280
所以你就多加了件事儿  好让我被解雇
So you decided to add a few tasks that could get me fired,

666
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,240
既然这让电影停拍也在所不惜吗
not to mention shut down the movie?

667
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,370
我根本没有料到  你真的做到了
I didn't think you could actually come through.

668
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,620
我以为你会告诉简  你没法完成
I thought you'd have to tell Jane you couldn't finish.

669
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,290
我比你更需要这份工作  好吧
I need this job more than you do, okay?

670
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,920
我得自己养活自己
I pay for my life.

671
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,640
我要付助学贷款  房租  汽车租用费
I have student loans, rent, a car lease.

672
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,110
我不能被炒
I can't afford to get fired.

673
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,070
那我就可以吗
And I can?

674
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,730
你是瑟琳娜·范德·伍德森
You're Serena van der Woodsen.

675
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,020
你在这走一圈
You do one lap around this party,

676
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,730
就会有十份工作到手
you'll get ten job offers.

677
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,860
你没花什么力气  就得到了这份工作
You weren't even looking when you found this one.

678
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,990
两周后  当你回到学校的时候
In two weeks, when you're at college,

679
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,870
你会把这份工作看得
will you even look back at this as anything more

680
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,990
比你暑假做的其他事更重要吗
than that thing you did that summer?

681
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,040
但这是我的事业
This is my career.

682
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,830
我还没找到他  等我找到他
I haven't found him yet, but when I do...

683
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,240
玛丽卢  等一下
Marilu, wait.

684
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,340
怎么了
What's going on?

685
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,260
是我把东西给帕特里克的
I'm the one that gave Patrick the pot.

686
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,430
他会接受是因为我说这是制片方允许的
And he only took it because I told him production okayed it.

687
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,810
有人耍了我
Someone played a joke on me,

688
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,860
但如果不是我急于证明自己的价值
and if I wasn't so intent on proving my worth,

689
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,060
我也不会这么容易上当
I-I wouldn't have fallen for it, but...

690
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,820
但是  我却做了
I did.

691
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,830
对不起
I'm sorry.

692
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,950
告诉简  明早我会把办公桌收拾出来
You can tell Jane I'll clear out my desk in the morning.

693
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,610
我没搞明白  路易  你在跟踪我吗
I don't understand, Louis. Are you following me now?

694
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,960
不  布莱尔
No, Blair.

695
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,990
其实
Actually...

696
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
你在这儿更好
It's fine if you are,

697
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,330
我可以当面直说了
because I can do this in person then.

698
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,280
路易不是为了你而来的
No, Louis is not here... for you.

699
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,270
不是吗
He's not?

700
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,530
到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

701
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,690
他今天晚上爽约
Louis didn't meet you tonight

702
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,940
是为了帮我
because he was helping me.

703
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,220
帮你干嘛
Helping you what?

704
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,310
去年春天  我写了篇关于你的文章
Last spring, I-I-I wrote a story about you,

705
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,480
由于各种原因
and due to a series of unfortunate events,

706
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,210
这篇文章要出版了
that story is going to be published.

707
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,040
是本来要出版
Was... going to be.

708
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,900
是这样
Was.

709
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,250
我请路易帮忙
Uh, I asked, and Louis kindly obliged to...

710
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,560
阻止文章出版
help me kill it before it came out

711
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,230
如此一来就不会让你难堪  他也做到了
so it wouldn't embarrass you, and that's exactly what he did.

712
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,670
他是你的真命天子
He really is your prince.

713
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
可能你觉得他太听妈妈的话
It may not have been standing up to his mother,

714
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,230
但他确实在保护你不受伤害
but it was protecting you against the world.

715
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,130
希望你明白
You gotta understand,

716
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,320
我真没想到会有人读那篇文章
I didn't ever think anyone would read it.

717
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,090
刚才你差点让我放弃了一切
You let me almost walk away from everything tonight.

718
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,750
其实你一直很清楚路易的行踪
And all the while, you knew exactly where Louis was,

719
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,700
知道他为我做的一切
exactly what he was doing for me.

720
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,160
你怎么能这样
How could you let that happen?

721
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,670
为什么你...
Why would you?

722
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,690
你到底什么居心
What possible reason could you have?

723
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,850
孤独男孩意识到  如果没遇到合适的人
Lonely boy learning three words, eight letters

724
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,800
那三个字千万不要说出口
don't come out right when no one wants to hear them.

725
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,310
路易  我们走吧
Come on, Louis. Let's go.

726
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,800
我不想待在这儿
I'm done here.

727
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,180
开心吗
Hey, are you happy?

728
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,730
我们想好要干嘛
We decided what we wanted,

729
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,510
就不顾一切奔过来了  但你看看现在...
went after it like you said, and look what happened.

730
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,490
没错  瑟琳娜
Yes, look. Serena,

731
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,730
你毫不犹豫地承担了责任
You accepted responsibility without hesitation

732
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,020
这也是你破天荒头一次吧
for maybe the first time in your life.

733
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,130
内特  改变自己的过程很有趣
And, Nate, you had more fun not being you

734
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,290
比过去一板一眼过日子好得多
than you've ever had actually being you,

735
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,000
现在你也明白了自己现在需要改变
which means you now know you need to change.

736
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,610
是我的错觉吗  还是他的话真有道理了呢
Is it just me, or is what he's saying actually making sense?

737
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,240
可能我们还没睡醒呢
Maybe we're not awake yet.

738
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,570
我们已经长大了
We're growing up.

739
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,260
得为自己负责
We need to start being responsible for ourselves

740
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,280
而不是总为他人负责
instead of always being responsible for others.

741
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,860
怎么  你都知道了吗
What, you knew?

742
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,000
内特  你肯定觉得我内心会崩溃
Nate, I know you think I must be dying inside

743
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,420
因为布莱尔要嫁给别人
because Blair is marrying another man.

744
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,090
但我们都已经想开了
But we let each other go.

745
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,780
别再这样了  多为自己想想吧
So stop doing stuff like this and start focusing on yourself.

746
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,430
至于你
And you.

747
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,200
虽然有些事不太顺
Though this part of your journey may have come to an end,

748
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,510
但你看到了另一个世界
it shows you there's a world out there you never knew existed,

749
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,840
虽从不知道其存在 却想融入的世界
one you want to be part of.

750
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,770
你有没有想过出本书
Have you ever thought of writing a book?

751
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,020
像我这样的人不写书  只会被写
People like me don't write books. We're written about.

752
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,630
好吧  我要去整理书桌
Okay, I should go clean out my desk.

753
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,970
我也要出去走走
Yep. I should probably get outta here, too.

754
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,770
昨天晚上把手机落派对上了
I'm pretty sure I left my phone at the party last night,

755
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,460
现在过去拿
and while I'm at it,

756
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,430
还得跟女主人道个歉
I should probably apologize to the hostess.

757
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,520
那就留我这个天才自己在这儿吧
I'll stay here alone with my genius.

758
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,440
来抱抱
Come here. Ah.

759
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,240
-注意保持距离  -别害羞嘛  别害羞
- Too close. Too close. - Don't be shy. Don't be shy. Don't be shy.

760
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,190
怎么了
What?

761
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,130
难道发型很难看吗
No, is it my hair?

762
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,950
有些话我不想当着路易的面说
I didn't want to say anything in front of Louis,

763
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,080
但我在贮藏室
but I found something

764
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,410
发现了这个
hidden in the pantry.

765
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,460
最近你对路易举止奇怪  是因为这个吧
Is this why you have been acting so strange about Louis?

766
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,370
有什么需要跟我说的吗
Is there something you need to tell me?

767
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,350
是我的错
Is me who needs to confess.

768
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,590
我要有第二个宝宝啦
Baby number two on way.

769
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,180
你昨天说的要改变未来的事
This is what you needed to tell me yesterday

770
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,370
就是这个吗
that would affect our future?

771
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,670
对啊  我想先告诉你
Yes. I-I just want to tell you first,

772
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,950
但你不在
but you were away,

773
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,830
我也不能直接短信你说 "嗨 又有了哦"
and it not right to text "Hello, pregnant!"

774
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,740
而且你回来后也没给我说话的机会
And--and then you were back, but you did not let me speak,

775
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,130
就这样  今天被发现了
and so now news comes out this way.

776
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,770
不过好在说出来了
At least news out.

777
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,550
"八卦天后"上都有我的消息  好受宠若惊
And "Gossip girl" talk about me. I feel so special.

778
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,370
恭喜恭喜
Congratulations!

779
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,930
好了好了  上东区的各位
Well, well, well, upper east siders.

780
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,140
我要的答案终于找到了
I got my answer after all,

781
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,380
看来霍道夫家里
and it turns out the only thing expanding

782
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,300
唯一需要的就是帮助
at the Waldorf residence is the help.

783
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,290
这些关于怀孕[双关:也有期待之意]的对话
Yet all this talk about expecting

784
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,410
让我想起了期盼与意料之外
has got me thinking about expectations.

785
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,230
我也没想到能在这儿遇到他
I had no idea I was gonna meet him out here,

786
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,710
我还想着到纽约才能见面呢
I didn't expect to make contact till New York.

787
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,290
但我觉得我会再见到他
But something tells me

788
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,540
而且会比想象中的早
I'm gonna see him again even sooner than I imagined.

789
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,310
看来要早得多
Oh, much sooner.

790
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,730
一会打给你
Call you later.

791
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,220
你来拿这个的吧
You must be here for this.

792
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,460
对  谢谢
Yes. Thank you.

793
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,630
还有  我知道你根本不认识我
And listen, I know you don't know really know me at all,

794
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,940
但我假扮了别人的身份
but I feel like I owe you an apology

795
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,410
得向你陪个不是
for pretending to be someone else.

796
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,550
我这么做  因为我觉得
And I only did it because I'm just now starting to realize

797
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,740
我还没有搞清楚自己到底是谁
that, well, I don't really know who I am.

798
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,340
不管怎么说  对不起
Anyway, I'm sorry,

799
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,950
但是跟你在一起很开心
but I still had a lot of fun with you.

800
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,250
我也是  我接受你的道歉
As did I. And I accept.

801
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,220
说不定我们还能再见面呢
Who knows? Maybe we'll see each other around sometime.

802
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,460
没错
Yeah.

803
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,200
再见
Good-bye.

804
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
回见
Bye.

805
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,210
你想见我吗
You wanted to see me?

806
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,840
是的  一大早我的日程上
Yes. There's a whole load of things

807
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,560
就排满了一堆待办事宜
I need done on my list this morning.

808
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,700
我想您没有听说那件事吧
Oh, I-I guess you didn't hear.

809
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,840
听说了  玛丽卢告诉我了
I heard. Marilu told me.

810
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,380
《美丽与毁灭》一周内就要杀青了
"The beautiful and the damned" wraps in a week,

811
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,510
你愿意继续为我工作吗
but how would you like to keep working for me?

812
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,960
每天  你都是第一个到岗上班
You're the first one in every morning,

813
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,860
最后一个离岗下班的
the last one to leave every night.

814
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,590
我需要像你这样甘于奉献  充满热情的人
I need someone with your dedication and fire.

815
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,210
不过如果下次你发现我给了你什么奇怪的任务
Although you might want to check with me

816
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,080
你最好跟我确认一下
the next time one of my tasks seems a little off-the-wall.

817
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,670
好
Yeah.

818
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,810
意下如何
Well, what do you say?

819
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,080
我非常乐意
I would love to.

820
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,740
你还好吗
Hey. What's going on?

821
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,930
莉莉又和设计师开会去了
Lily has another meeting with the decorator.

822
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,130
她已经重装修好几次了  但感觉都一个样
She's redecorated so many times, it looks exactly the same.

823
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,530
我和安迪·科恩说该为她制作一个节目
I keep telling Andy Cohen he should make a show about her

824
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,600
就叫"纽约真人版软禁"
called "The real house arrests of New York."

825
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,640
那你可以来这儿陪我
Well, you can, uh, hang here with me,

826
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,420
顺便帮我处理这些邮件
help me with this mail.

827
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,440
很好  正好在911十周年
Good, because I have some time

828
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,420
纪念专辑推行前夕  我还是挺有空的
before the 9/11 memorial 10th anniversary album launch.

829
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,810
喔  对了  你写的故事很棒
Oh, and by the way, your story was amazing.

830
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,590
谢谢你与我分享  我只是有点儿疑惑
Thanks for letting me read it. I'm just a little bit confused.

831
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,970
我以为会有一些布莱尔的反面描写
I-I expected something negative about Blair,

832
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,180
但其实  恰好相反
but in fact, it was quite the opposite.

833
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,360
那你又为什么不愿出版呢
Why was it so important that no one read it?

834
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,630
你看结局了吗
Did you make it to the end?

835
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,330
我以为那结局是一种唯美的写法
Well, I assumed that was artistic license.

836
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,810
不过真的...  有发生吗
Did... that actually happen?

837
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,080
无可奉告
Mm. A writer never tells.

838
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,030
你看过一个章节了  我现在只要确保
So now I just have to make sure that

839
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,400
那本书永远不要出版就行了
the book that chapter comes from never sees the light of day.

840
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,530
原来是一整本书呀
There's a whole book?

841
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,630
别激动  我希望瓦内萨
Well, don't get too excited. I'm hoping, uh,

842
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,720
只是泄露了一个章节给杂志社
Vanessa only leaked the one chapter to the magazine,

843
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,160
目前看来他们只有这一章节
since that's all they had.

844
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,480
看这个
Oh, look.

845
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,100
巴塞罗那寄来的航空件
Air mail from Barcelona.

846
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,750
所谓期望
The thing about expectations

847
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,430
就是大多时候  别人早已为你做好安排
is most of the time, someone else sets them for you,

848
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,800
瓦内萨寄给丹的信

849
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,170
面值一万美金的支票

850
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,540
恭喜你出版第一本小说

851
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,930
然而你感觉他们一直在左右观望
Yet you feel like they've been there all along

852
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,280
让你不得不达到他们的期望
and you can't wait to live up to them.

853
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,380
可以走了吗
You ready to go?

854
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,550
我不去了  你猜怎么着
I'm not coming. Guess why.

855
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,890
简给了我一份工作
Jane offered me a job.

856
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,950
你怎么回答的
What did you say?

857
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,110
我说 好的
I said yes!

858
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,470
真的吗  太棒了
Really? That's great.

859
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,480
谢谢
oh, thank you.

860
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,900
多亏有你们两个
I mean, it wouldn't have happened without you two.

861
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,020
来庆祝下吧
How about now?

862
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,250
为你崭新的洛杉矶生活破一次例吧
Your new L.A. Lifestyle ready to make an exception?

863
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,850
我也是这么想  开吧
Well, I think so. Pop it open.

864
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,110
我就知道会这样
Of course that happened.

865
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,140
那边更衣室里有盥洗室
There's--there's a bathroom in the dressing room right there.

866
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

867
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,710
就这么喝吧
Just... come on.

868
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,110
虽然你知道别人对你的期望
But just because you know what's expected of you

869
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,410
但这并不代表你就不能给他们一个意外惊喜
doesn't mean you still can't surprise everyone.

870
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,200
布莱尔
Blair...

871
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,830
你真美
you look beautiful.

872
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,870
当然啦
Of course she does.

873
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,600
妈妈  这不是布莱尔的捧花
Mother, Blair is not carrying those.

874
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,960
我还有一些事情
And there are some other things

875
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,990
要和您商量一下
I need to talk to you about, too.

876
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,100
他们知道了吗
Do they know?

877
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,780
知道什么
Know what?

878
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,020
知道你怀孕多久了
How far along you are.

879
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,380
我猜...  6周了吧
I'd say... six weeks?

880
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,390
他们给过我你的尺寸
They sent me your measurements.

881
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,600
显然你不懂尺寸
Well, you obviously can't read,

882
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,550
或者说他们给你的尺寸是错的
or they were wrong when you got them...

883
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,280
因为我没怀孕
Because I'm not pregnant.

884
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,490
随你怎么说
Lie to me all you want,

885
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,030
但是婚礼那天
but your body will be telling the whole world the truth

886
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,690
你的体型会显露真相的
by the time of your wedding.

887
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,710
纸是包不住火的
Nothing stays hidden for long.

888
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,830
庆祝我们搬家1个月
The one month anniversary of our move.

889
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,640
真是难以置信
It's crazy.

890
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,150
难以置信的是如果不是你叔叔留给你的钱太少
What's crazy is if your uncle hadn't left you

891
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,920
我们也不至于要离开迈阿密
