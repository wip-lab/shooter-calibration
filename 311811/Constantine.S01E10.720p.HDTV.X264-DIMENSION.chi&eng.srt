22
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,910
把灵魂交给我[拉丁语]
Eripe animam,

23
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,930
血液全归于我[拉丁语]
flere sanguine venire

24
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,220
我将...[拉丁语]
ad me, et ponam

25
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,340
赐你安睡[拉丁语]
te in somnum.

26
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,560
睡觉也要打扮得美美的哦  特里西娅
Can't get pretty sleep without looking pretty, Tricia.

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,610
你先等着  一会我也会给你打扮得美美的
Now wait your turn and I'll make you pretty, too.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,870
我在房子周围施放了一个障眼法
I cast a duplicity spell around the perimeter of the property.

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,900
从现在开始  任何寻找磨坊的人
From now on, anyone searching for the mill house

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,990
最终都只会离磨坊
will find themselves on a path leading away

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,450
越来越远
from the mill house.

32
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,070
这个地方现在安全了  泽德
This place is safe now, Zed.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,030
我之前也是那么想的  但他们还是找到了我
That's what I thought before, but they still found me.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,360
他们是谁
And who are they?

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,930
听着  之前你闭口不提你的过去
Look, you kept your cards close about your past

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,680
我都尊重你的意思  但现在不行了
and I chose not to push, but I am pushing now.

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,380
他们自称为圣临十字军
They call themselves the Resurrection Crusade.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,790
他们要你做什么
And what do they want with you?

39
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,670
他们就是疯子
They're fanatics.

40
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,930
全然相信他们首领对于未来的预见
Completely bent on their leader's vision of the future.

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,030
而那个首领
And-and he-- the-the leader?

42
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,440
他认为我是那个未来的关键
He believes I'm crucial to the vision.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,060
这么说你是被一群狂热邪教份子盯上了
So you found yourself in the crosshairs of a delusional cult.

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,620
他们自己可不是这么认为的
In their minds, they're... they're much more.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,960
我必须得躲起来
And I need to disappear.

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,790
这次我非走不可了
And this time I need to stay gone.

47
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,100
如果你真要找地方躲起来
If you need to disappear...

48
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,880
这里再适合不过了
best place to do it is here.

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,050
你的那些保护措施根本不够
All the protections you've used-- they're not enough.

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,980
他不找到我是不会甘休的
He'll never stop searching for me.

51
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,400
你连地狱的恶魔都毫不畏惧
You're yet to flinch in the face of the underworld.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,980
为什么你这么怕他
Why are you so afraid of a man from this one?

53
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,630
因为他是我父亲
Because he's my father.

54
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,210
我才不管他是不是你的父亲
Well, I don't care if he's the heavenly bloody father,

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,820
亲爱的  他得先过了我这关
luv, he ain't getting past me.

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,050
为什么要帮我  你为什么相信我
Why do you want to help me? Why do you believe me?

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,310
我这人向来靠直觉
I survive on instinct.

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,960
我的直觉告诉我你信得过
Mine tells me that you're all right.

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,250
再说了  你怎么着也算是个美人
It doesn't hurt that you're easy on the eyes, as well.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,550
我也希望能这么跟你说
Wish I could say the same.

61
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,320
真是谢了啊
Oh, thanks.

62
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,280

约翰
Hey, John.

64
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,760
地图上又出现了血迹
The scry map-- it's bleeding again.

65
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,000
这回轮到纽约市这大苹果了
Painting the Big Apple red.

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,130
查斯这周要去看女儿
It's Chas's weekend with his daughter.

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,670

He's on his way to Brooklyn right now.

68
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,860

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,520

73
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,530
{\an9}*宝贝  我是你的男人*
*Baby, I'm your man...*

74
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,070
你穿着我喜欢的那件蓝色情趣内衣吗
Hey, you wearing that blue teddy I like?

75
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,750
你觉得我穿上很好看吗
You like the way it looks on me?

76
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,870
不  蕾妮
No, Renee.

77
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,390
我觉得扒掉它更好看
I like the way it looks on the floor.

78
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,680
杰拉尔汀还等着你回家哄她睡觉呢
Geraldine's waiting for you to tuck her in.

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,270
我也等着你呢  你什么时候回家
I'm next in line. When are you coming home?

80
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,770

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,570
我们走吧  亲爱的  没错  就这样
Let's get out of here, luv. All right, that's lovely.

82

Hey, Chas.

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,810
查斯  查斯  我得走了
Chas, Chas, I've got to go.

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,920
我钓到一个妞  你买单好吗
I've got a bird. So pick up the tab, yeah?

85
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,460
上一次还有上上次都是我买的单
I picked up the last tab and the one before that.

86
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,850
那我下两次  下三次都我买好了
Yeah, but I'll get the next, um... two. Three.

87
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,690
-走吧  -等我一会儿
- Go. Go. - Listen, just give me a second.

88

91
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,050
你骗人
You're a liar.

那些烟火把东西烧着了
The pyrotechnics are causing a fire!

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,840
起火了
Fire!

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,220
起火了
Fire!

103
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,610

起火了  快逃啊
Fire! Clear out!

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,820
太多人挡住门口了
There's too many bodies blocking the door!

106
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,290
小心
Look out.

107
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,980
{\an9}*别害怕死神*
*Don't fear the reaper*

108
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,500
当地新闻已经有报道了  看
It's already hit the local news. Look.

109
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,760
布鲁克林大概有十二个人
About a dozen people in Brooklyn

110
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,790
陷入了无法解释的昏迷中
have fallen into unexplained comas.

111
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,860
黑暗崛起的力量日益增强
As the Rising Darkness grows,

112
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,740
它的目标也越来越多
so will its targets.

113
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,370
布鲁克林只是个开始
Brooklyn will be just the beginning.

114
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,210
你不是要简装出发吗  只带点必需品
I thought you were packing light, only the essentials.

115
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,560
这些就是必需品
Which is what it is.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,890
这是阿莱斯特·克劳利的东西
This belonged to Aleister Crowley.

117
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,170
当我不知从何下手的时候
When I haven't a clue where to begin on a case,

118
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,020
它能帮我找到头绪
helps me know where to start.

119
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,400
这是什么
What is this?

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,390
我的手麻了
My-my hand's numb.

121
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,970
查斯最爱的玩意儿
Chas's favorite trick--

122
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,780
阿喀琉斯脚踝的肌腱
sinew from Achilles' heel.

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,270
它对魔法免疫
Impervious to magic.

124
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,870
世上最有韧性的东西
Highest tinsel strength on this world or any other.

125
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,720
我以为阿喀琉斯的脚踝是他的死穴
I thought Achilles' heel was weak.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,860
现在你知道为什么了  走吧
Well, now you know why. Let's go.

127
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,040
她撑不住睡着了
She stayed up as long as she could.

128
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,530
我给她买了这个  我去看看她是不是还醒着
Well, I-I bought this for her. I'm gonna go see if she's awake.

129
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,890
我一个小时前抱她上楼了
I carried her up an hour ago.

130
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,950
至少让我替她掖掖被子吧
You could've at least let me tuck her in.

131
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,550
你抱怨说总见不到女儿
You complain that you never get to see your daughter,

132
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,310
但每个能来探视的周末
but then you're late every weekend,

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,230
你却总是迟到  弗兰西斯
you have custody, Francis.

134
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,640
我请求过你了  别这么叫我  蕾妮
I've nicely asked you not to call me that, Renee.

135
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,250
你为什么又晚了
Why are you late?

136
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,560
宝贝  你还醒着吗
Sweetie, you awake?

137
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,020
蕾妮
Renee!

138
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,320
蕾妮
Renee!

139
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,230
杰拉尔汀  宝贝
Geraldine, baby.

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,150
还是不接电话
Still no answer.

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,610
查斯留言里说了什么
What did Chas say in his message?

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,090
该说的都说了
Everything he had to.

143
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,360
他需要我们
That he needs us here.

144
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,540
伙计  我们尽快赶来了
Came as fast we could, mate.

145
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,530
出了什么事
So, what's the story?

146
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,150
我只放心把她交给你  约翰
You're the only one I'd trust with her, John.

147
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,500
不管发生什么
Well, whatever this is, mate,

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,960
我们都会陪你一起解决
we're in it with you, all right?

149
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,890
所以
So...

150
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,750
能跟我们说说事情经过吗
you want to tell us what happened?

151
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,230
我发现她倒在地上流血不止  就赶紧把她送来医院
I found her on the floor bleeding. We raced here,

152
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,050
我看见还有六个患者也有相同症状
I saw six other patients with the same symptoms.

153
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,160
他们说是昏迷  可这不像我见过的
They're calling it a coma, but this isn't like any coma

154
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,380
任何一种昏迷
I've ever seen.

155
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,930
她是我女儿  我应该
She's my daughter, I should...

156
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,490
-在她身边保护她的  -你也不知道
- should've been here for her. - There's no way

157
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,340
她会遇上这种事  查斯
you could've known she was in trouble, Chas.

158
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
她的嘴唇裂开了
Her lips are chapped.

159
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,520
这是天火焚烧的痕迹
Celestial burn marks.

160
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,120
当灵魂离体的时候就会留下这种痕迹
Left behind when a soul departs.

161
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,730
所以这只是杰拉尔汀的躯体
This is just Geraldine's body?

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,430
至少还活着  是个好事
Alive and breathing, which is the good news.

163
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,500
那坏事是什么
And the bad?

164
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,610
这个...
Well...

165
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,240
如果她的灵魂被用于黑暗用途  那么
if her soul is being used for a dark purpose, then

166
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,020
她没多少时间可活了  最多一两天吧
she doesn't have long-- a day or two at most.

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,850
-怎么才能把灵魂和肉体分离  -分不了
- How can you separate a soul from a body? - You don't.

168
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,540
这是黑魔法的最高境界
It's the, uh, Holy Grail of black magic.

169
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,880
许多凡人试过  但无一成功
Many a mortal have tried and failed.

170
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,200
我要你不惜一切代价救回她  约翰
Promise me you'll do whatever it takes to get her back, John.

171
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,340
那你得先保证  你要完全照我说的做
You promise me that you'll do everything I tell you.

172
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,160
谢谢
Thank you.

173
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,840
客气  大兄弟
All right, big man.

174
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
我有个老朋友  以前曾是灵媒
I have an old friend who used to be a medium.

175
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,020
他可以联系到杰拉尔汀
He can contact Geraldine.

176
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,090
但愿她能告诉我们她在哪
Hopefully she can tell us where she is.

177
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,630
不过我需要一件  她的个人物品
I just need, uh, one of her personal belongings.

178
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,320
没事的  宝贝
It's okay, sweetheart.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
我会好好保管它的
She's in good hands.

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,370
行吧
Yeah.

181
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,260
他在这干什么
What's he doing here?

182
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,630
约翰是来帮忙的
John's here for support.

183
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,790
你好  蕾妮
Hello, Renee.

184
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
我是泽德
I'm Zed.

185
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,100
给你个建议
Piece of advice?

186
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,540
不管他出了门往哪走  你最好跟他分道扬镳
Whichever way he goes out that door, you go the other.

187
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,280
我们在外面等
We'll be right outside.

188
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,740
跟我说实话
Tell me the truth.

189
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,340
他来干什么
Why is he here?

190
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,800
他会想尽办法救回杰拉尔汀
'Cause he'll do whatever it takes to save Geraldine.

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,070
就像纽卡斯尔那次一样吗
What, like he saved that girl in Newcastle?

192
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,220
我不知道你为什么这么盲目地跟着他
I don't know why you follow him around so blindly,

193
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,790
但别让他碰我们的女儿
but keep him away from our daughter.

194
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,750
爸爸
Daddy.

195
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,550
查斯
Chas?

196
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,020
我的天  查斯  你
Oh, my God, Chas, you're...

197
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,420
我还以为我再也见不到你了
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

198
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,500
我就在这呢  爸爸
But I've been right here, Daddy.

199
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,380
他们把你从火场救出来的时候
God, they told us that you were dead

200
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,280
就告诉我们你没救了
when they pulled you out of that fire.

201
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,730
我当时在救一个女孩
I was helping a girl escape.

202
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,730
我是该活不成的
I should be dead.

203
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,840
但你活下来了
Oh, you're alive now.

204
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,910
这就够了
That's all that matters.

205
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,680
{\an8}军品专卖

206
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,020
那个灵媒就住这
This is the medium's place?

207
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,920
你的朋友还真是三教九流啊  约翰
You got friends in low places, John.

208
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,900
进去吧
Come on.

209
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,020
赶牛棒
Cattle prod?

210
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,930
怎么了  我一直想买一个
What? I've always wanted one.

211
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,980
不是吧
Really?

212
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,420
哪有灵媒卖军品的
What kind of medium works at an Army surplus store?

213
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,450
有妄想症的就会
A paranoid one.

214
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,950
你好啊  菲内尔
Hello, Fennel.

215
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
我说什么来着
Told you.

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,610
-滚出我的店  -我还以为你们是朋友
- Get your ass out of my store. - I thought you were friends.

217
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,510
显然有人把友谊给忘了
Apparently, one of us has forgotten.

218
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,930
有个女孩的灵魂被偷了
A girl's soul has been stolen.

219
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
我们需要你来联系她
We need you to help us contact her.

220
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,770
你身边站着的是个骗子和小偷
You walked in here with a liar and a thief.

221
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,980
不管你说什么
You can ask all you want,

222
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,080
我都绝不会帮助约翰·康斯坦丁的
I'll never help John Constantine.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,960
你不帮不行
We're not asking.

224
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,940
看来好东西都藏在这呢
Take it this is where the good stuff's kept.

225
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,680
你做得好  我就欠你一个大人情
You do this right, I'll be in your debt,

226
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,380
我的人情可不是说着玩的
and that's no small fee.

227
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,720
我可以给你接点干净水
I can get you some clean water.

228
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,270
这是约旦河水
It's from the River Jordan.

229
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,470
能使交流过程更顺畅
Acts like a lubricant for communication.

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,010
我一给你信号  你就把布娃娃给我
I give you the signal, you give me the doll.

231
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,410
都听你的  哥们
It's your show, mate.

232
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,970
[咒语]

233
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,240
[咒语]

234
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,840
[咒语]

235
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,480
[咒语]

236
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
[咒语]

237
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,610
[咒语]

238
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,700
[咒语]

239
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,630
她来了
She's with us now.

240
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,490
别打断联系
Don't break the connection.

241
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,710
杰拉尔汀  我会救你回来的
Geraldine, I'm gonna get you back.

242
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,140
坚持住  宝贝
You just hold on, baby.

243
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,770
爸爸  这是怎么回事
Daddy, what's happening?

244
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,070
我是约翰叔叔  亲爱的
It's your Uncle John, luv.

245
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,400
你身边有别人吗
Is there anyone with you?

246
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,100
没有  就我一个人  我很害怕
No, I'm alone. I'm scared.

247
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,880
没事的  宝贝  你看看周围
It's all right, sweetheart. Now, I need you to look around.

248
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,490
告诉我你看到了什么
Tell me what you see.

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,810
我看到...我看到...
I see... I see...

250
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,850
谁胆敢跟我偷走的灵魂说话
Who dares speak to one of my stolen souls?

251
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,160
她去哪了  怎么回事
Where'd she go?! What's happening?!

252
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,520
有人控制了菲内尔
Someone's taken control of Fennel,

253
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,760
很明显不是杰拉尔汀
and it certainly isn't Geraldine.

254
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,800
是你吗  约翰·康斯坦丁
Oh, is that you, John Constantine?

255
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,430
好久不见
It's been a long time.

256
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,940
自报家门
Identify yourself.

257
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,270
像真男人一样面对我
Face me like a real man,

258
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,630
而不是躲在别人身体里跟个木偶似的
not with your hand up another's ass like a bloody puppet.

259
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,660
这事你管不了的
It's more than you can do.

260
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,600
很抱歉我没时间浪费在你这种人身上
I'm sorry I don't have time to waste on your likes.

261
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,710
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you are.

262
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,440
我警告过你了  康斯坦丁
You've been warned, Constantine.

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,180
为你们的主人[拉丁语]
Et stabit de domino

264
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,930
站出来  所有人[拉丁语]
vestro, aliquis.

265
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,520
为你们的主人站出来[拉丁语]
Et stabit de domino vestro.

266
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
听我号令[拉丁语]
Audite vocem meam.

267
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,850
我们的降神被另一个法师强行控制了
Our seance was hijacked by another mage.

268
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,100
他用了一个强大的咒语
He used a powerful spell,

269
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,520
把菲内尔烧成灰烬了
turned Fennel into a bloody crisp.

270
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,270
他说出了你的名字  他认识你
He said your name. He knew you.

271
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,610
是的  我们都知道  这不是什么好事
Yes, admittedly, not a good thing,

272
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,190
但他确实说了好久不见
but he did say it had been a long time.

273
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,540
我们这完全是在浪费时间
And all we've done is waste ours.

274
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,620
你对我承诺过的
You made me a promise.

275
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,560
我也准备信守这个承诺  查斯
It's a promise that I aim to keep, Chas.

276
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,350
我们距找出
We're one step closer

277
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,920
劫走你女儿的人又近了一步
to finding the man that's holding your daughter hostage.

278
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,040
只有五本书上记载了这个咒语
Only five books contain this spell,

279
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,690
而这些书都被一位爱尔兰高王分散在世界各地
each scattered across the globe by an Irish High King.

280
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,750
如果我们能找到距离最近的那本书...
Now, if we can find the location of the nearest book...

281
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,900
就能找到杰拉尔汀
We find Geraldine.

282
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,800
正是
Exactly.

283
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,250
让我摸摸咒语
Let me hold the spell.

284
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,830
你在哪
Where are you?

285
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,920
废弃的火车厂  或是...
Dusty rail yard or...

286
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,750
实验室
laboratory.

287
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,550
我也说不好
Um, I'm not sure.

288
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,200
我看到有大锅
I see cauldrons

289
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,460
很多书  还有火车
and books and a train car.

290
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,780
找找标识  标语
Look for a sign, a placard,

291
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,110
任何能让给你信息的东西
anything that can give you a name.

292
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,120
哈斯金斯火车厂
"Haskins Railroad Yard."

293
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,630
你看到杰拉尔汀了吗
Do you see Geraldine?

294
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,080
没有
No.

295
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,950
看起来就我一个人
It looks like I'm all alone.

296
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
过来  让我看看
Here. Let me look at that.

297
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,860
看来那人法力高强  这是我不想见到的
Someone out there has more power than I care to chance upon.

298
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,270
告诉我发生了什么
Tell me what happened.

299
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,640
有一阵打旋的蒸汽
There was a swirling vapor

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,510
从我身边飘过  我一转身
that drifted past me. When I turned around,

301
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,080
一个穿斗篷的男人
there was a man in a cloak,

302
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,220
拿着刀冲向了我
and he lunged at me with a knife.

303
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,200
坩埚和书籍  斗篷和匕首
Cauldrons and books, cloaks and daggers.

304
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,860
可能是炼金术士  或者疯掉的魔法师
Could be some sort of alchemist or a mage gone mad.

305
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,070
他长什么样  描述给我听
What did he look like? Describe him to me.

306
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,700
冷静  查斯  让她喘口气
Easy, Chas. Just let her breathe.

307
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,160
别让我冷静
Don't tell me easy.

308
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,050
我想知道夺走我女儿的男人长什么样子
I want to know what the man who has my daughter looks like.

309
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,970
我们去见见他吧  怎样
Let's go and see for ourselves, shall we?

310
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,050
你是说哈斯金斯火车厂吗
Haskins Railroad Yard, you say?

311
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,760
-是的  -那好吧
- Yeah. - All right, then.

312
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,260
我们去看看
Let's check it out.

313
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,910
电话簿上写的就是这地址
According to the phone book, this is the address.

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,300
我打电话给交通局了
I called the Transit Authority.

315
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,090
他们说哈斯金斯火车厂几年前就关了
They said Haskins Railroad Yard was shut down years ago.

316
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,980
又是死胡同  这简直是在浪费时间
More dead ends, more wasted time.

317
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,590
我听说百分之九十的真相都源于直觉
I've heard it said that nine- tenths of reality is perception,

318
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,910
而在我看来  是百分之一百二十
and in my trade, it's eleven-tenths.

319
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,910
你瞧
Ah, you see?

320
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,850
假如一位法师
If a mage

321
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,840
不能完全改变你对真实的感知
can't completely change your idea of what's real,

322
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,560
那么...他的把戏就不起作用了
well, then... the trick don't work.

323
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,530
那东西哪去了
Where'd it go?

324
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,720
世间五行元素  吾虔诚召唤汝
Five elements of the earth, I respect and invoke thee.

325
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,260
源于六方  皆汇于此
From the six directions, converge here.

326
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,200
揭示真相  显露真身
Lift all concealments, reveal thy truth.

327
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,770
这是隐形的
It was invisible.

328
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,610
是用了障眼法  还是初级的那种
By way of a cloaking spell, and an elementary one at that.

329
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,940
无论住在这里的是谁
But whatever taking up residence here

330
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,920
绝对不是什么好人
certainly harbors a dark side.

331
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,840
他们还没见识到我的黑暗面
They haven't met mine.

332
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,330
我预感到了你要来
I had a feeling you'd come.

333
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,650
我甚至暗地里希望你会来
I think I even hoped you would.

334
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,850
你对那个女孩的灵魂做了什么
What have you done with the girl's soul?

335
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,780
你得说得更具体一些
You'll have to be more specific.

336
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,320
我的听力大不如前了
My hearing isn't what it used to be.

337
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,670
泽德
Zed,

338
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,150
来见见菲力克斯·浮士德
Meet Felix Faust,

339
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,460
他给当代最厉害的黑魔法师
lifetime apprentice and second fiddle

340
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,830
当了一辈子的学徒和副手
to the greatest black magicians of his generation.

341
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,240
的确是副手  康斯坦丁
Second fiddle indeed, Constantine.

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,540
魔法师不过是照本宣科  我却是创造者
The mages played the melody, but I wrote the concerto.

343
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,230
他们不过是站在我的肩膀上取得成就的
They built their legends on my shoulders.

344
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,940
去别处宣传你这论调吧  菲力克斯
Spin your tune someplace else, Felix,

345
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,440
领我去见你的主子
and point me to your master.

346
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,890
这是我一人所为  没别人
This is my doing, no one else's.

347
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,590
我一辈子都在服侍别人
I spent a lifetime serving others.

348
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,010
如今我只为自己
Now I serve only myself.

349
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,390
他说的是实话  约翰
He's telling the truth, John.

350
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,180
他不过是一位垂垂老矣的法师
He's a geriatric spell caster,

351
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,200
追逐着遥不可及的辉煌成就
chasing a prime that never was.

352
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,020
我以一己之力发现了将灵魂与身体分离的方法
I alone discovered how to separate soul from body,

353
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,500
而那些灵魂给予了我更多的力量
and those souls have given me more power

354
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,900
这是当代任何魔法师都做不到的
than any magician of the modern age.

355
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,940
其中一个灵魂是我女儿的
One of those souls belongs to my daughter.

356
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,560
-我要夺回来  -不行
- I'm taking it back! - No!

357
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,280
住手  浮士德
That's enough, Faust!

358
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,650
我说了  住手
I said, that's enough!

359
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,700
你告诉我...
You tell me...

360
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,560
你想要什么
what do you want?

361
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,250
我想要你来侍奉我
I want you to serve me.

362
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,080
一个名叫魇魔的凶残恶魔
A malignant demon named Karabasan is

363
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,610
正在猎食我的猎物
preying on my victims,

364
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,570
吸取属于我的力量
siphoning powers that belong to me.

365
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,220
既然有你供我指使  我就没必要以身试险了
I see no reason to endanger myself when I have you at my beckoning.

366
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,080
把那寄生虫赶回地狱
Cast the parasite to hell,

367
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,860
我就放了那女孩
and I'll free the girl.

368
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,600
他在撒谎吗  约翰
Is he lying, John?

369
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,010
天资卓越  有诚信的法师
One talented and honorable mage

370
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,180
是绝不会对自己的同类撒谎的
would never lie to another.

371
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,970
以大法师德狄之名
In the name of Dedi of Djed-Sneferu.

372
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,880
誓言永存
He who endures.

373
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,680
那个肮脏的恶魔在哪里
Where is the demonic bottom-feeder dwelling?

374
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,770
在红钩区的一处废弃仓库里
In an abandoned warehouse in Red Hook.

375
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,380
为了他女儿  我建议你们...
And for the sake of his daughter, I suggest

376
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,980
在他来找你之前...
you find him...

377
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,030
你先找到他
before he finds you.

378
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,420
我们为什么要走
Why are we leaving?

379
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,810
只要魔法师一死  他的咒语就会失效
If a magician dies, his spells are broken.

380
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,860
我们杀了他吧
Let's kill him.

381
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,100
你感受过拥有那些灵魂的他有多强大了
You felt what he can do with those souls in his pocket.

382
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,080
在我们找出他的弱点之前  得先照他的规则来玩
We play his game until we can find an advantage.

383
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,290
你什么时候开始害怕菲力克斯·浮士德了
Since when do you run from Felix Faust?

384
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,090
上次见到他时  你在地狱厨房跟他玩扑克
The last time we saw him, you were taking his gin money

385
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,040
还把他的酒钱都赢光了
in a Hell's Kitchen poker game.

386
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,220
可他现在比我更强了
Now he's bloody stronger than me.

387
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,310
这都是黑暗崛起导致的
That's the problem with the Rising Darkness.

388
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,660
甚至像浮士德这样的废物
Even a relic like Faust

389
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,120
也能在一夜之间变得充满威胁
can become lethal overnight.

390
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,900
我们会想尽办法救她出来的  查斯
We'll keep doing all we can, Chas.

391
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,490
我们现在做的还不够
What we're doing isn't enough.

392
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,850
她的时间不多了
She doesn't have much time.

393
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,940
你答应过我的  约翰
You promised me, John.

394
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,720
你也答应过我你什么都会听我的
And you promised me you'd do exactly as I said.

395
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,670
当你攻击浮士德时
You know, when you attacked Faust,

396
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,110
你该庆幸他没有动手抹杀杰拉尔汀的灵魂
you're lucky that he didn't snuff out Geraldine's soul in spite.

397
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,220
那个老头终于得到了这么多年来
That old man finally has the power

398
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,520
他梦寐以求的力量
that he's always yearned for.

399
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
这人狠毒狡诈  还暴躁偏激
He's vicious and impulsive,

400
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,070
杀死他的唯一办法
and the only way to kill him

401
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,440
就是打破他的防御
is to get inside his defenses.

402
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,800
在此之前  我们得照他说的做以等待时机
And until we do that, we bide our time and we do as he says.

403
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,350
现在去医院吧
Now, go to the hospital.

404
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,950
陪着蕾妮
Be with Renee.

405
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,600
你不能赶查斯走
You can't ask Chas to leave now.

406
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,830
不能吗
Oh, can't I?

407
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,610
我们已经害得一个人送命了
We already left behind one dead body,

408
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,420
他本不该死的
didn't deserve what he got.

409
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,830
我们需要头脑清醒的人
We need clear heads.

410
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,580
不是你走  就是我走
You go or I go.

411
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,250
我了解他比对我自己都更了解
I know that man better than I know myself.

412
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,150
他就是个火药桶
He's a bloody powder keg.

413
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,240
他要爆发的时候我们最好离远点
We don't want to be anywhere near him when he blows.

414
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,680
魇魔可不是个好对付的
Karabasan's a nasty bugger.

415
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,300
专对熟睡的受害者下手  麻痹他们的身体
Preys on sleeping victims, paralyzing their bodies

416
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,350
吃掉他们的内脏  夺走他们的生命
as it dines on their innards and sucks their life away.

417
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,320
菲力克斯那些昏迷的受害者们
Felix's coma victims

418
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,200
就是他送上门的大餐
are a meal ready to eat.

419
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,420
我们帮浮士德驱逐了魇魔
Won't banishing Karabasan

420
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,960
不是只会让他更强大吗
only make Faust stronger?

421
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,840
短期内是的
For the short term, yes,

422
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,910
但这能保住杰拉尔汀的性命
but it keeps Geraldine alive,

423
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,530
给我们争取到想出应对计划的时间
gives us a chance to figure out a plan.

424
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,940
我们得让那个恶魔被困在魔法阵里足够长时间
We need the scourge held in the circle long enough

425
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,670
这样我才能将它赶回地狱
so I can order it to hell.

426
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,780
当魇魔进入这里  我们立刻退到魔法阵外
When Karabasan enters, we'll retreat behind this circle line.

427
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,390
只要它一走进来
When he steps inside...

428
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,100
它唯一的去处就是地狱
the only place he's going is down.

429
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,010
我们不能在这里和它玩捉迷藏了
We can't play hide-and-seek with it in here.

430
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,650
这地方就是个迷宫
It's a bloody labyrinth.

431
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,900
那我们让它来找我们
Then we'll make it come to us.

432
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,780
{\an8}47名酒吧火灾遇难者名单公布

433
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,490
我看过了
I saw that.

434
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,270
真是个悲剧
Bloody tragedy.

435
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,210
我们两个真不知道走了什么运
Horseshoes up our asses, you and I.

436
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,990
走得还真是及时
How lucky were we to leave when we did?

437
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,360
我没走
I didn't leave.

438
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,380
那地方被烧毁的时候我在里面
I was there when that building burned down.

439
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,120
这上面说从废墟中找到了47名遇难者
Says there that 47 victims were pulled from the rubble.

440
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,210
那我告诉你  其实是48名
And I'm telling you there were 48.

441
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,700
我身上的烧伤  创伤  骨折
I had burns, injuries, broken bones.

442
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,930
全都痊愈了
All healed.

443
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,390
一夜之间
Overnight.

444
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,240
一定有什么地方不对  约翰
Something isn't right, John.

445
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,960
竟然真的成功了
It bloody worked.

446
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,240
什么成功了
What bloody worked?

447
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,520
我在酒吧时在你身上施的保护咒
The protection spell I cast on you at the bar.

448
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,390
你那是醉了在说胡话  才不是魔法
You were drunk and mumbling. That wasn't magic.

449
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,590
那是鬼扯
That was... pathetic.

450
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,700
你不懂  那咒语是个神话
No, you don't understand. That spell is a myth.

451
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,090
一个传说
A legend.

452
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,460
由大法师梅林为亚瑟王所创并亲自施放
Merlin created it and cast it at the behest of King Arthur.

453
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,180
任何受到咒语保护的圆桌骑士
If any Knight of the Round Table under that spell

454
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,950
如果与低阶骑士一同战死的话
was killed in the company of lesser knights,

455
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,590
他会吸收身边所有人的生命
he would absorb all the lives of those around him.

456
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,920
你想说什么
So what are you saying?

457
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,860
那咒语不仅救了你一命
That the spell not only saved your life,

458
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,300
还让你获得了火灾里其他死者的命
but you gained all the lives of those lost in the fire as well.

459
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,330
你是说我死不了
You're saying I can't die?

460
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,150
不  恰恰相反  你还是会死
No, on the contrary, you most certainly can die.

461
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,970
准确地说  是四十七次
47 times, to be precise.

462
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,200
你确定要这么做吗
You're sure you want to do this?

463
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,690
没错
Yeah.

464
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,050
我们终要与他一战  为何不在我们的地盘打
We either fight him on his ground or ours.

465
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,950
再说了  冒着生命危险的可不止我一个
Besides, I'm not the only one who's risking my life here.

466
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,220
查斯为我牺牲了很多
Chas has risked much more for me.

467
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,200
让我的挚友失望  会毁了我
Failing my best friend, that would ruin me.

468
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,640
但是你这里失败了  咱俩都完了
But failing you, that ruins us both.

469
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,420
那就别搞砸了
Then don't screw up.

470
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,900
咒语会立刻让你入睡
The spell will put you to sleep straightaway.

471
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,350
魇魔会感觉到
Karabasan will feel it.

472
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,750
当他进入圈中
When he enters the circle,

473
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,130
我就解除咒语  你滚出陷阱
I'll break the spell, you roll out of the trap,

474
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,540
然后我就点火
and I'll light it.

475
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,280
你最好说话算话
You better.

476
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,540
立刻沉睡吧[拉丁语]
Molles somnos, somno iam.

477
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,840
快啊
Come on.

478
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,740
现在  醒醒吧[拉丁语]
Nunc igitur consurge consurg.

479
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,270
做个好梦吧  你这丑陋的怪物
Sweet dreams, you ugly bastard.

480
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
都让开  别挡道
Clear the way. Coming through, people.

481
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,090
借过
Coming through.

482
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,290
情况越来越糟了  约翰
It's getting worse, John.

483
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,270
说点我不知道的行吗
Tell me something I don't know.

484
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,680
搞定了  查斯
It's done, Chas.

485
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
我们回去找浮士德
We're heading back to Faust.

486
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
可能需要你的帮助
We could use you as backup.

487
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,050
走吧
Let's do it.

488
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,020
等等  浮士德
Wait, Faust?

489
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,920
就是夺走我女儿灵魂的那人  对吗
That's the man that has my daughter's soul, isn't it?

490
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,040
我和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

491
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,010
这不是个好主意
Not a good idea.

492
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,540
听他的话吧  蕾妮  求你了
Listen to him, Renee. please.

493
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,530
他的话我听了很多年了
I have listened to him. for years.

494
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,880
全是约翰·康斯坦丁的丰功伟绩
Tall tales of John Constantine.

495
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,510
我一直听他的  直到最终害我们离婚收场
I listened to him until it tore us apart.

496
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,110
我要和你一起去
I'm coming with you.

497
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,620
能管管她吗  查斯
Deal with this, will you, Chas?

498
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,000
这是我的家庭  我的
This is my family. Mine.

499
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,670
我去外边等
I'll be outside.

500
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:21,960
你说得没错  是你的
You're right. it is.

501
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,970
但知道吗  当你女儿醒来的时候
But you know what? you-you got to be here

502
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,260
需要你在她身旁陪着她
for when your daughter wakes up.

503
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,860
好吗  我在这里陪你
Okay? I'll stay here with you.

504
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,410
求你了
Please.

505
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,170
带她回来
Bring her back.

506
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,980
她是我的一切
She's all I have.

507
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,740
我让你那魔鬼歇了
I put your sleep demon to bed.

508
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,390
现在该履行你的承诺了
A deal is a deal.

509
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,600
把女孩的灵魂交出来  浮士德
Let's have the girl's soul, Faust.

510
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,070
是的  我感觉到力量回来了
Yes, I felt the power return.

511
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,010
但是咱们的约定是将魔鬼赶回地狱
But our deal was to banish the beast to hell--

512
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,390
你却将它彻底毁灭了
you destroyed it by energy dispersion.

513
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,510
我们说好的  用恶魔换我女儿的灵魂
The deal was that demon for my daughter's soul.

514
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,330
我要改一下约定条款
I'm changing the terms of our agreement.

515
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,210
-约翰  -别
- John... - No.

516
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,410
这么多人的生命在你手中流逝
All those people wasting away by your hand as life passes them by.

517
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,620
你可不想死后落得这么个名声吧  菲力克斯
That is not the legacy you want, Felix.

518
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,100
你又懂什么
And what would you know of legacy?

519
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,310
自负  肮脏  乳臭未干的小子
A boastful, smutty, infantile boy.

520
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,930
靠着巧合和傲慢就学会了魔法
You create magic by accident and insolence,

521
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,500
而那些呕心沥血苦心钻研的人却得不到一点回报
while the truly devoted sweat and toil with no reward.

522
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,750
你永远不可能学会我的魔法  康斯坦丁
You'll never know my magic, Constantine.

523
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,000
但你会尝到我吃过的苦头
You will know my pain.

524
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,620
新的条件是什么  浮士德
What's the new price, Faust?

525
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,040
我们已经照你说的做了
We already paid his price.

526
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,320
再做一次  不然就跟你的女儿永别吧
And you'll pay it again or say good-bye to your daughter forever.

527
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,620
我们人就在这  挟持我女儿的人也在这  动手吧
We are here. The man who has my daughter is here. We act now.

528
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,750
你想要我怎么做
And what would you have me do?

529
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,470
使个伎俩  骗骗他  施个咒
A trick. A con. Cast a spell.

530
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,360
这些你都玩多少次了  随便什么都行
Pull something out of your ass like you always do.

531
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,580
睁开眼睛好好看看行吗
Open your eyes, will you?

532
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,640
如今浮士德占上风
Faust is still holding all the cards here.

533
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,490
我们不能总是被他牵制
We can't do this forever.

534
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,090
我女儿等不了这么久
My daughter does not have forever.

535
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,590
她的选择不多了
And she doesn't have many chances left,

536
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,550
但如今最有希望的仍然是我
but her best one still lies with me.

537
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,840
她已经信过你一次了
You've had your chance.

538
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,690
我把女儿的生命托付给你  你却失败了
And with my daughter's life at stake, you failed.

539
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,240
我见识过其他人在你失败后的下场
I've watched other people suffer the consequences of your action,

540
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,420
但这次是我的家人
but this is my family.

541
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,770
所以现在我说了算  不是你
So I'm gonna do things my way, not yours.

542
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,410
是吗  那你打算怎么办
Yeah? And how would you plan to do that?

543
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,600
我家人为你受的罪够多了
My family's suffered enough because of you.

544
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,760
生日快乐  亲爱的
Happy birthday, sweetie.

545
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,630
我买了你最喜欢的蛋糕  薄荷巧克力味的
I got you your favorite, mint chocolate chip.

546
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,400
对不起  我来晚了
I'm sorry I was late.

547
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,530
你不是来晚了
You weren't late.

548
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,130
你是错过了
You missed it.

549
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,870
我知道这听起来很疯狂
I-I know this sounds crazy,

550
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,580
但我必须得帮约翰干掉猴王
but I had to help John to slay the monkey king.

551
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,530
那怪物几乎把一家几口人活剥了
It tried to eviscerate an entire family.

552
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,610
我救了那孩子的命  却牺牲了我自己孩子的幸福
I saved the kids' lives, but I had to sacrifice my own's.

553
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,670
保护别人的家庭  这真的
Caring for another family, it's...

554
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,190
令人敬佩  查斯
Admirable, Chas.

555
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,480
但我们自己的家呢
But what about ours?

556
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,200
这占据了你的生活   也影响了我们的家庭
This is consuming your life, and it is poisoning ours.

557
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,370
47条人命没了  转到了我的身上
47 lives cut short and the balance left on mine.

558
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,170
我有责任让他们死得其所
It is my duty to make them count.

559
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,710
你唯一有责任的是我们
The only duty that you have is to us.

560
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,190
我理应有一个像样的丈夫
I deserve a husband.

561
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,150
你的女儿理应有一个像样的父亲
Your daughter deserves a father.

562
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,730
你需要好好关心一下你自己的家人  
You need to start caring about your own family.

563
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,890
在你还有一个家的时候
While you still have one.

564
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,870
想找个更好的搭档吗
Looking for better company?

565
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,100
我知道给草包卖命是什么滋味
I know what it is to toil beneath lesser men.

566
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,730
你是来拍更佳搭档的马屁吗
Have you come to curry favor with a better one?

567
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,630
我可以拿32条灵魂跟你换我女儿的灵魂
I can give you 32 souls in exchange for my daughter's.

568
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,390
有意思  但你跟我一样是凡人
Intriguing. However, you're mortal like me,

569
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,770
我们只有一条灵魂
with only one soul to offer.

570
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,220
她的名字叫杰拉尔汀
Her name is Geraldine,

571
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,390
我以她的性命担保
And I'm telling you, on her life,

572
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,260
我这身体里还有其它32条灵魂
I'm carrying 32 souls inside this chassis.

573
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,170
我只看到...
The only thing I see...

574
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,100
一个绝望的可怜虫不惜说谎来拯救他的女儿
is a desperate, pathetic man lying to save his daughter.

575
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,930
现在  我要取走你的灵魂
Now I'm going to take your soul.

576
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,990
别这么着急
Not so fast.

577
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,410
我确实骗了你一件事
There's one thing I lied about.

578
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,390
经过这之后  我只能给你31条灵魂了
After this, I'll only have 31 souls left to offer.

579
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,030
布鲁克林的昏迷事件数量仍在增加
The number of coma cases is still spreading in Brooklyn,

580
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,690
迫使白思豪市长宣布
prompting mayor Bill de Blasio to declare New york

581
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,700
纽约进入公共卫生紧急状态
a public health emergency.

582
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,030
更多详情我们将在11点继续为您报道
More details coming up on our next report at 11:00.

583
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,970
医生说她的身体快不行了了
Her doctor said her body's shutting down.

584
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,930
事发的时候我就在家
I was home when it happened.

585
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,210
却没能保护她
I didn't protect her.

586
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,830
这事你也无能为力
There's nothing you could've done.

587
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,380
我知道你和查斯的关系并不是很好
I know everything isn't roses between you and Chas,

588
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,610
但如果他在这  他也会这么说的
But if he were here, he'd say the same.

589
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,210
当然了
Of course.

590
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,540
查斯这人简直体贴过了头
Chas is considerate to a fault.

591
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,290
尽管我和查斯关系不好  但还好我们有她
Things aren't roses between Chas and me, but we always had her.

592
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,380
她知道你在她身边
She knows you're here with her.

593
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,500
我生来...  就有通灵的能力
I'm a... a born psychic.

594
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,730
我能感受到一部分的她也在这里
I can feel part of her here with us.

595
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,590
等等  你是说你能跟她交流
Wait, can you communicate with her?

596
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,590
如果我能跟杰拉尔汀说上话
If i could just talk to Geraldine,

597
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,370
让她知道我在她身边就好了
if I could just let her know that I'm here.

598
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,460
她一定很害怕
She must be so scared.

599
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,420
我试试吧
I'll give it a shot.

600
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,660
好吧  你可以的
Okay. Okay.

601
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,600
你能做到的
Okay.

602
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,000
妈妈
Mommy?

603
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,330
是你吗
Is that you?

604
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,640
杰拉尔汀  我在这呢  宝贝
Geraldine. Geraldine. Geraldine, I'm right here, baby.

605
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,460
泽德  泽德  快醒醒
Zed. Zed! Zed, snap out... snap out of it.

606
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,910
快叫医生过来  泽德
We need a doctor in here! Zed!

607
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,370
让开点  没事的
Make way, make way. It's okay.

608
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,070
放松  没事的
Easy, now, easy.

609
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,610
能听到我吗
Can you hear me?

610
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,720
我们是来帮你的  告诉我发生什么事了
We're here to help. Tell me what's going on.

611
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,410
{\an8}杰拉尔汀
哈斯金斯火车厂
橡园大道14030号  纽约

612
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,570
赶紧让辛医生过来  快
Get Dr. Shin in here, stat.

613
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,620
你确实是个言出必行的人
A man of your word, indeed.

614
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,820
我倒希望那是真的
I wish that were true.

615
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,790
如果你愿意将31条灵魂交给我  再加上你自己的
If you willingly commit 31 souls to me, including your own,

616
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,920
我就同意释放你女儿的灵魂
I agree to free your daughter's soul

617
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,740
让她回到自己的躯体中
and return it forthwith to her body,

618
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,740
并确保她有生之年不再骚扰她
where it shall remain safely until her natural death.

619
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,600
成交
Done.

620
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,570
法师之间才用得到血誓
The blood oath is for mages.

621
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,920
那我们就握个手吧
I'll settle for a handshake.

622
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,360
查斯
Chas!

623
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,640
别这么做
Don't do it.

624
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,210
如果你把那些灵魂连同自己的都交出去  你会死的
If you surrender those souls and yours, you will die.

625
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,400
不要啊
No!

626
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,380
我要改变约定条款
I'm changing the terms of our agreement.

627
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,670
你做了什么
What have you done?

628
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,540
今天我们一起死去
We both die today

629
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,970
但只有一个人能复活
and only one of us is coming back.

630
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,340
躲远点  约翰
Clear out, John!

631
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,450
你要这么做也行  伙计
Happy to do it your way, mate.

632
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,600
查斯
Chas!

633
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,400
-蕾妮  -你要做什么
- Renee? - What are you doing?

634
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,950
-救回我们的女儿  快跑  -趴下
- Saving our daughter. Run! - Get down!

635
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,880
我的老天
Oh, my... oh, my god.

636
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,550
天哪  天哪
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

637
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,870
没事的  亲爱的  没事的
You're all right, luv. You're all right.

638
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,470
不  我有事  我一点都不好
No, I'm not all right! It's not okay!

639
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,150
你看到他刚做了什么吗
Did you see what just happened to him?

640
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,230
他这么做很多次了  亲爱的  这就是他的工作
Many times, luv. Many times. This is what your husband does.

641
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,540
这就是他的能力
This is who he is.

642
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,810
都怪你
Because of you!

643
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,970
全都怪你
It's because of you!

644
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,580
都怪你
You!

645
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,130
很抱歉你得看见那些
Sorry you had to see that.

646
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,210
查斯的工作不是一般人能接受的
Chas's line of work is messy.

647
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,120
你的也是
So's yours.

648
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,260
查斯这么做会痛苦吗
Is it painful for Chas?

649
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,560
痛苦至极
Excruciating.

650
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,280
这个...  一般要多久
Uh, so how long does this take?

651
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,090
我是说...  他活过来
For him to-to return?

652
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,610
那要看死法有多惨烈了
Well, it depends on how violent the death.

653
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,230
但总有代价的
There's always a cost.

654
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,430
你学得倒挺快
You're learning.

655
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
我想让你知道
Now, look, for what it's worth,

656
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,500
我不是有意害你和查斯分手的
I never meant to get between you and Chas.

657
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,670
如果我可以回到过去改变一切
If I could go back and change it all,

658
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,460
我一定会的
I would.

659
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,040
可惜我做不到  但也因为如此  他才能活下来
But it's not in the cards, and because of it, he's alive.

660
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,590
许多人才能活下来
So are a lot of other people.

661
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,570
包括你们的女儿
Including your daughter.

662
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,910
她很快就会醒了
She'll be waking up soon.

663
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
你去守着她吧
You should go be with her.

664
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,110
蕾妮说她不再信任我了
Renee says I've broken her trust.

665
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,250
她要离开我  约翰
She's gonna leave me, John.

666
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,640
我不会让杰拉尔汀失去父亲
I won't let Geraldine grow up without a father.

667
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,320
你必须帮我逆转咒语  解决这问题
You have to reverse this spell. Fix this.

668
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,810
很抱歉  伙计  但我做不到
I'm really sorry, mate, but I can't.

669
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,660
我已经试了好几天了
I've been trying for days.

670
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,180
我没法这么活下去
I can't live like this.

671
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,250
你可以的
Yes, you can.

672
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,430
你可以选择把它当成是个包袱
You can shoulder this burden,

673
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,450
让内疚一点一点吞噬你
let it consume you from within.

674
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,550
也可以将这种能力纳为己用
Or you can wield it as you have.

675
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,650
来帮助我一起对抗邪恶
A weapon against evil by my side.

676
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,720
怎么决定在你  伙计
Whichever way you choose, mate,

677
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,060
不管决定是什么  我都会支持你
I'm with you every step of the way.

678
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,960
天哪  你活过来了
Oh, my god! You're alive.

679
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,450
你早就知道的
You knew I would be.

680
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,190
没错  但不是亲眼所见我还是不敢相信
Yeah, but seeing and knowing are two different things.

681
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,180
她在楼上
She's upstairs.

682
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,390
正等着你呢
Waiting for you.

683
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,520
谢谢你
Thank you.

684
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,880
爸爸
Daddy.

685
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,030
早啊  亲爱的
Hi, sweetheart.

686
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
妈妈说你早上会来
Mommy said you would be here in the morning,

687
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,910
我还不相信
but I didn't believe her.

688
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,590
虽然有时我答应来陪你却没有做到
I'm not always here for my weekends with you.

689
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,840
但我真的努力了  宝贝
But I always try, baby.

690
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,230
这是给我的吗
Is that for me?

691
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,360
我很喜欢
I love it.

692
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,470
谢谢你
Thank you.

693
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,230
这下我们有一样的
Now we match.

694
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,590
我也有东西给你
I got something for you, too.

695
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,120
你要给我讲故事吗
Are you going to tell me a story?

696
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,390
可不止一个呢
I'm gonna tell you a few.

697
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,910
我想让你认识些我的朋友
I want to introduce you to some friends of mine.

698
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,280
我每天都将他们的照片带在身边
I carry them with me every day.

699
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,260
那是谁
Who's that?

700
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,430
她叫苏珊·史密斯
That is Susan Smith.

701
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,230
她是个护士
She was a nurse.

702
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,850
还是个母亲
And a mother.

703
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,280
她有两个跟你一样大的女儿
She had two little girls just your age.

704
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,390
我刚才怎么了
What happened to me?

705
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,350
你晕过去了  亲爱的
You blew a fuse, luv.

706
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,510
将灵魂这么暴露在灵体世界是件很危险的事
You know, it's not safe to bare your soul to the spirit world.

707
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,920
那需要多年的训练
It takes years of training.

708
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,140
你为什么要这么做  傻姑娘
So why the bloody hell did you do it, you silly sod?

709
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,620
一个小女孩的灵魂
A little girl was...

710
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,260
被一个疯老头挟持了
at the mercy of a mad man.

711
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,730
你终于肯敞开心扉了  这是好事
You're opening up. That's great.

712
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,340
但也别操之过急  好吗
Just, uh, don't open so soon, yeah?

713
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,950
都听你的  约翰
Whatever you say, John.

714
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,260
还有一件事
One more thing.

715
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,800
是关于你母亲的
About your mother.

716
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,680
我母亲怎么了
What about my mother?

717
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,640
她说别为她的死而自责
She said her death wasn't your fault.

718
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,090
你见到我母亲了
You saw my mother.

719
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,150
泽德
Zed?
