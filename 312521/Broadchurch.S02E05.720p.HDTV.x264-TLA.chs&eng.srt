《小镇疑云》前情提要
Previously on Broadchurch...

17
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,540
你认出扛着尸体的男人了吗
Did you recognise the man carrying the body?

18
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,400
是的
Yeah, I did.

19
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,080
你能在法庭上说出那个人的名字吗
Can you name that man for the court?

20
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,830
奈杰·卡特  他是我儿子
Nigel Carter. He's my son.

21
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,250
一定要办一个以丹尼命名的慈善会
There's going to be a charity in Danny's name.

22
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,500
有一个小组  跟已知的性犯罪者打交道
There's a small group. They work with known sex offenders.

23
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,330
一个女孩的尸体仍未找到  凶手逍遥法外
A girl's body is still missing. The killer is walking free.

24
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,240
那案子臭名远扬
That case is tainted. 

25
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,390
没人愿意再碰它
Nobody wants to get near it.

26
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,200
都是我的错  我要弥补这一切
That's my failing. I've got to put it right.

27
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,710
-我说我整晚都和李在一起  -那是真的吗
- I said I was with Lee all night. - Was that true?

28
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,940
不  我当时在我朋友家里
No, I was at a friend's house.

29
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,750
-那天晚上发生了什么  -他给我下了药
- What happened that night? - He drugged me.

30
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,900
我早上5点醒来时他在打扫整个屋子
I woke up at 5.00 am and he was cleaning the whole house.

31
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,760
你和瑞奇的事我很遗憾
Sorry to hear about you and Ricky.

32
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,960
已经很长时间了
It was a long time coming.

33
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,230
甚至在他女儿被杀时
Even the moment his daughter was being killed

34
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,060
他还正在搞一个伴娘
he was shagging one of the bridesmaids.

35
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,090
婚礼上你们不是在一块吗
You were at the wedding together?

36
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,620
你之前一直说那晚你们在一起
You always said you were together that night.

37
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,850
你从没提过
You never mentioned that.

38
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,390
瑞奇  你离凯特远点
Ricky. You leave Cate alone.

39
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,390
为什么一个父亲不希望
Why would a father not want an investigation to restart

40
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,910
重新调查他女儿的死因
into the death of his own daughter?

41
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,500
也许李·阿什沃斯不是凶手
What if Lee Ashworth didn't do it?

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,600
进来吧  亲爱的  她不咬人
Come in, sweetheart. She won't bite.

43
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,930
-你不会哭出来吧  妈妈  -不会
- You're not gonna cry, are you, Mum? - No.

44
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,760
别那么跟你妈说话
Don't talk to your mum like that.

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,770
没事  谢谢  露西
It's fine, thanks, Luce.

46
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,820
谢谢你同意见我
Thanks for agreeing to see me.

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,980
露西姨妈说我非见不可
Aunt Lucy said I had to.

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,190
学校怎么样
How's school?

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,670
跟我说说庭审的事
Tell me about the trial.

50
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,300
真的吗
Really?

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,870
你以为这事不会被提起吗
Did you think we're not going to mention it?

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,580
好吧
Right, OK, er...

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,500
看到你父亲站在那里很艰难
Well, it's hard seeing your dad there.

54
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,170
如果你那么肯定是他干的
If you're so sure he did it,

55
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,650
他为什么申辩无罪
why is he pleading 'not guilty'?

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,970
我也希望我知道  我觉得他是怕了
I wish I knew but I think because he's scared

57
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,100
无法面对发生的事
and I think he can't bear to face up to  what's happened.

58
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,330
人有时会这样
People do that.

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,630
你错了
Well, you've got it wrong.

60
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,790
汤姆  我知道你希望是那样
Tom, I know you want that to be true

61
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,910
也知道你怪我
and I know you blame me.

62
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,650
但你爸杀了丹尼
But your dad killed Danny

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,140
如果我早发现发生了什么事
and if I could have spotted what was going on

64
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,210
如果我能回到过去  撤销一切
or if I could go back and make it un-happen,

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,880
我会的  但我做不到
I would, but I can't.

66
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,620
谁站在他那边  谁替爸爸说话
Who is on his side? Who's speaking up for Dad?

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,710
你不用担心他  他的出庭律师很厉害
You don't have to worry about him. He's got a good barrister.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
我想提出的是
But what I wanted to suggest 

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,180
希望你能回来跟我一起住
was that you came back to live with me

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,330
我不再住公寓了  我们回家住
and I give up the flat and we go back to the house.

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,250
不要
No.

72
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,070
-你能听我说说吗  -不要
- Would you just listen for a moment? - No!

73
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,170
我不会回去的
I am not going back.

74
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,430
那再过段时间吧
Well, soon, yeah?

75
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,090
不要
No.

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,300
好吧  至少跟我抱抱吧
OK. Can I at least have a hug?

77
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,140
我爱你  超过巧克力
I love you, even more than chocolate.

78
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,120
你不用跟我一起来审问这女人
You don't have to come with me to question this woman.

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,100
不  我想来  我的生活都毁了
No, I want to. My life has all gone to shit.

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,460
解决你的问题至少能让我分分心
At least fixing your mess gives me a distraction.

81
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,840
你要搬回去吗
Are you going to move back in here?

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,040
等汤姆愿回来的  我们去不去了
Only when I've got Tom back. Are we going or not?

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,350
你说你是哪里来的
Where did you say you were from?

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,700
南麦喜亚警方  我们在查一桩老案
South Mercia police. We're looking at an old case.

85
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,340
2012年4月14日  你是否作为伴娘
On 14 April 2012, were you the bridesmaid

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,020
参加了马丁和艾斯特-凯莉
for Martin and Esther Kelly's wedding

87
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,000
在朗索恩酒店的婚礼
at Longthorne Hotel?

88
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,690
我记不清日子了  但我的确去了婚礼
I don't know if that was the date but I was at the wedding.

89
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,980
你那晚是否跟一个
Did you have sex with a man

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,790
叫瑞奇·吉莱斯皮的男人上床了
called Ricky Gillespie that night?

91
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,390
你们真不是闹着玩的
Wow, you don't mess about!

92
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,440
女儿被杀的那个瑞奇吗
You mean Ricky whose girl was killed?

93
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,290
对
Yeah.

94
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,930
没有  他的确想泡我
No, I didn't. I mean, he tried it on.

95
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,720
一整晚都对我纠缠不休
He was after me all night.

96
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,480
我去换鞋的时候  甚至跟我回了房
He even followed me to my room when I went to change my shoes,

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,080
我当时的高跟疼死了
cos my heels were killing me,

98
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,220
他拿了个银酒壶
and he had this little silver hip flask.

99
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,140
一直想劝我跟他喝一杯
He kept trying to make me have a drink with him

100
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,110
但我让他出去了  太过分了
but I threw him out. A bit much. 

101
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,590
他是跟妻子一起去的呢
He was there with his wife.

102
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,350
我最后看到他  他正往停车场去
The last I saw, he was heading back through the car park.

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,700
-他在你房里待了多久  -5到10分钟
- How long was he in your room for? - Five or ten minutes.

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,700
那晚再没见到他
I didn't see him for the rest of the evening.

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,230
凯特·吉莱斯皮错了
So Cate Gillespie was wrong.

106
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,820
瑞奇没跟别的女人在一起
Ricky wasn't with another woman.

107
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,240
他消失了两小时  他去哪了
Nobody saw him for two hours. Where was he?

108
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,020
谁会带酒壶去婚礼啊
And who takes a hip flask to a wedding?

109
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,440
你觉得他是想给她下药吗
Do you think he was going to drug her?

110
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,320
我没听过他做过这种事的报告
I haven't heard any reports of him trying that sort of thing.

111
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,010
克莱尔说李以前也那么对她
Claire said that's what Lee used to do to her.

112
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,050
你说他们四个会不会都那么做过
Do think it's something all four of them used to do?

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,840
我不知道
I don't know.

114
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,920
等今天法庭的事完了  我们去找她
When we're done in court today we'll talk to her.

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,080
你上次检查视力是什么时候了
When was the last time you had your eyesight tested?

116
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,820
夜视呢
What about your night vision?

117
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
做过测试吗
Ever had that tested?

118
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,070
没有
Never had a test.

119
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,220
但我常吃胡萝卜[治夜盲]
But I eat a lot of carrots.

120
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,480
所以说你并不清楚自己
So, you have no idea how far you can see

121
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,480
在白天和晚上的视域
either in the daytime or at night?

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,220
我能看见月亮  那够远吗
I can see the moon and that's a fair distance.

123
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,700
很好  能说说你儿子卡特先生吗
Very good. Can we turn to your son, Mr Carter?

124
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,170
你28年没见过他了  是吗
You hadn't seen him for 28 years, had you?

125
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,750
我知道他什么样  如果你是这个意思
I know what he looks like, if that's what you're getting at.

126
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,890
卡特先生给警方留下的宣誓证词中
In Mr Carter's sworn statement to the police he says,

127
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,390
他说"我根本不认识她"
"I don't even know who she is."

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,830
"我不想跟她有瓜葛"
"I don't want anything to do with her."

129
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,990
警方错了  警方常犯错
Police got it wrong. Police get it wrong all the time.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,410
-就是这样  -不是的
- It's a fact. - It's not, actually.

131
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,560
你不是给她做过准备吗
I thought you'd prepped her.

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,300
她简直是个麻烦精
She's a bloody liability!

133
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,290
她跟我在一起时不这样
She wasn't like this with me.

134
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,500
请回答你被问到的问题  怀特女士
Stick to answering the questions you've been asked, Miss Wright.

135
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,060
好
Ok!

136
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,500
你最初在海滩上看到丹尼尸体的时候
When you first saw Danny's body on the beach,

137
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,700
你为什么没叫救护车
why didn't you call for an ambulance?

138
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,740
那时已经来不及了
A bit late by then.

139
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,070
你似乎很肯定啊  你核实过吗
You seem very certain. Did you check?

140
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,240
你有这个医疗资质吗
Are you medically qualified?

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,340
发生了什么显而易见
It was obvious what had happened.

142
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,260
但你为什么不报警呢
Why didn't you call the police?

143
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,800
我当时不想牵连奈杰
I didn't want to dump Nigel in it.

144
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,140
你如何解释警方鉴证发现
How do you explain police forensics finding

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,470
丹尼尸体附近有四根带有你DNA的烟头
four cigarette butts with your DNA on them next to Danny's body?

146
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,100
我经常在海滩上抽烟
I've smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach.

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,840
-你为什么拿走滑板  -我担心被人偷走
- Why did you take the skateboard? - I thought it might get nicked.

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,770
的确被偷了啊  你偷了
It did get nicked, didn't it? By you!

149
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,450
我觉得他家人会想要回去
I thought the family would want it back.

150
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,140
你认识玛吉·雷德克里夫吗
Do you know who Maggie Radcliffe is?

151
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,270
不
No.

152
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,170
她是《广教镇回音报》编辑
The editor of the Broadchurch Echo.

153
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,300
你于2013年7月24日闯进了她的办公室
Whose office you broke into around 11.37pm on 24 July, 2013

154
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,610
你用我复述的这句"我能找到人强奸你"
and whom you threatened by saying, and I quote,

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,670
威胁了谁
"I know men who would rape you."

156
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,090
-什么  -我不知道这事
- What? - I don't have that.

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,300
这不是真的
Not true.

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,010
什么不是真的  你是虚张声势还是真能找到
What's not true? You don't know men like that or you do?

159
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,700
我从没说过这话
I never said it!

160
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,640
她为什么要说谎
Why would she lie?

161
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,510
-她是名记者  -是的
- She's a journalist. - Right!

162
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,470
记者和警察都说了谎
Journalists and police lie 

163
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,560
而你是这里唯一诚实的女人
and you're the only honest woman here.

164
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,000
随你怎么说
If you like.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
从你站上证人席起  在法庭上说的每一句话
Isn't it true that every word you have told this court

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,450
是不是都是假的
since you stood up in the witness box is a lie?

167
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,940
-不是  -你没看到奈杰·卡特
- No. - You didn't see Nigel Carter.

168
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,190
-你看到的是乔·米勒  -不是
- You saw Joe Miller. - No!

169
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,600
但你想把罪名推到弃你而去的儿子身上
But you want to pin the blame on the son who's rejected you.

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
-不是  -你在庭上一次又一次地撒谎
- No! - You've lied to this court time and again,

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,050
就像你向警方撒谎一样
just as you've lied to the police!

172
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,490
-不是  -陪审团为什么要相信你所说的话
- No! - Why should the jury believe a single word you say?

173
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,360
你别以为这就算赢了
You ain't all that.

174
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,590
要是我知道这些  我不会去找她当证人的
I wouldn't have gone anywhere near her if I'd seen that!

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,990
我知道  抱歉
I know. I'm sorry!

176
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,050
你知道吗  要是你少花点时间
Do you know what, maybe if you spent a little less time

177
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,940
对我指手画脚
trying to tell me how to do my job 

178
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,090
多花点时间在你自己的工作上
and a bit more time on your own work

179
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,390
我们就有机会帮他正名了
we'd stand a chance of getting him off.

180
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,120
别灰心
Chin up.

181
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,610
在庭上撒谎  开心吗
Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
站在被告席上的可不是我的丈夫
It's not my husband in the dock.

183
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,650
-我想你肯定全都知道  -不
- I suppose you knew all along. - No!

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,810
你当然知情
Of course you did.

185
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,420
我们都清楚
We all know.

186
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,470
只是装作不知道罢了
We all turn a blind eye.

187
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,110
与我无关  事情不是这样的
Not me - that's not what happened.

188
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,410
是啊
Of course not.

189
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,330
你就继续这么骗自己吧
You just keep telling yourself that.

190
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,230
-你还好吗  -他们总觉得我早就知道这事
- Are you all right? - They'll always think I knew.

191
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,210
无论判决如何  他们始终觉得我也有份
No matter what the verdict, they'll always think I was in on it.

192
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,630
给人们点时间
Just give them time.

193
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
真是个好主意
Oh, brilliant.

194
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,640
谢谢你的狗屁客套话  解决了一切麻烦
Thanks for that shitty platitude. That's fixed everything.

195
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,620
-克莱尔知道我们要去吗  -不知道
- Does Claire know we're coming? - No.

196
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,460
关于那晚的事
I want you to tell me

197
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,760
我要你把告诉米勒的话完整地说给我听
what you told Miller about that night.

198
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,400
我以为这事只有你我知道
That was supposed to be between us.

199
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,680
我和他之间没有秘密
There are no secrets between him and me.

200
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,330
是吗
Is that right?

201
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,490
克莱尔  我不管你之前说了什么
Claire, I don't care what you've said before. 

202
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,950
现在我想要知道真相
I want the truth now.

203
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,950
正如我之前跟你说的那样
That night I went to see a friend, Marie,

204
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,220
那晚我去见了一个朋友  名叫玛丽
like I told you before.

205
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,250
但是...
Except...

206
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,450
我没在她家过夜  我回家和李喝酒了
I didn't stay over. I came home and I had a drink with Lee.

207
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,200
我觉得他在我的酒里下了安眠药
I think he spiked my drink with Rohypnol.

208
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,710
我睡了很久  当我醒来的时候已经是早上了
I was out for a long time and when I woke, it was morning.

209
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,520
-他在打扫屋子  -怎么个打扫法
- He was cleaning. - What sort of cleaning?

210
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,810
打扫卫生间  洗床单
Bathroom. Washing linen.

211
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,080
吸尘  擦洗地板
Hoovering. Washing floors.

212
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,390
他说他想来个春季大扫除
He said he fancied a spring clean.

213
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,780
他先给你下了药  然后打扫屋子
So, he's drugged you, now he's cleaning the house

214
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,910
第二天早上隔壁家两个女孩
and the next morning two girls

215
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,300
被报失踪
get reported missing from next door

216
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,830
而你不觉得该把这事告诉别人吗
but you don't think to tell anyone?

217
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,150
我不想那样怀疑他
I didn't want to think it was possible.

218
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,480
现在呢
What about now?

219
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
-你觉得会是他杀了那两个女孩吗  -不
- Do you think he could have killed those girls? - No.

220
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,540
关于那晚的事  这是你所说的第三个版本了
This is now the third version of that night you've come up with.

221
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,220
之前你为什么不告诉我这些
Why couldn't you tell me this before?

222
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,990
我不想让你知道他对我做了什么
I didn't want you knowing what he used to do to me.

223
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,210
你要做什么
What are you doing?

224
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,650
这是谁的电话号码
Whose number's that?

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,830
我不知道  这是通打进来的电话
I don't know. It was an incoming call.

226
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,030
-我以为是打错了  -这是拨出去的号码
- I think it was a wrong number. - It was an outgoing call.

227
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,520
对  我想回拨过去确认下  通了后...
Yeah, because I called it back to check and it just rang and-

228
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,630
这个区域号是你和李居住的地方的
This area code, that's where you lived with Lee.

229
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,970
-我觉得你在讯问我  -没错
- Now I feel I'm being questioned! - Too bloody right!

230
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,100
你是我的关键证人
You were my key witness

231
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,590
现在你却说一直在撒谎
and now you say you're lying all along.

232
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,900
-我没撒谎  -那是什么
- I'm not lying! - What, then?

233
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
-我是想保护他  -保护他还是保护你自己
- Trying to protect him. - Him or yourself?

234
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,200
这不公平
That's not fair!

235
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,110
最后再问一遍
So this is now definitively,

236
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,610
刚才所说是那晚发生的一切吗
this is what happened that night?

237
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,840
是的
Yes.

238
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,910
真的吗
Really?

239
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,630
克莱尔
Claire?

240
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,720
还有...
There is erm...

241
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,550
你走那天他来了这里  我们在楼上做了
He was here when you went away and we had sex upstairs.

242
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,510
什么  克莱尔
What, Claire?!

243
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,020
你抛下我一人  亚力克
You left me alone, Alec.

244
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,790
我跟你说过  对我而言他就像毒品
And you, I've told you, he's like a drug to me.

245
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,630
我控制不住我自己  根本控制不住
I can't stop myself! I can't!

246
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,140
-走吧  米勒  -你们这就走了
- Come on, Miller. - Are you going?

247
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,310
我不想一个人待在这
I don't want to be on my own, please.

248
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,690
要看孩子  抱歉
Child care. Sorry.

249
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,230
那现在怎么办
What happens now, then?

250
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,240
米勒
Miller!

251
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,170
之前我们说起的那件事
The thing we were speaking about -

252
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,260
和改过自新的性犯罪者会面
meeting reformed sex offenders.

253
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,600
-我替你安排好了  -好的  真快啊
- I've managed to arrange it for you. - Oh, right. That was quick.

254
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,890
你还想跟他们会面吗
You still want to do it?

255
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,990
想的吧  我也不知道  我有点害怕
I think so. I don't know. I'm a bit scared of it.

256
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,280
我和玛吉也会在场的
Maggie and I will be there too.

257
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,660
我知道关于庭审你有很多事要忙
I know you've got a lot on with the trial,

258
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,090
要是你想推迟...
so if you want to delay...

259
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,720
-不  没关系  -马克呢
- No, it's good. - What about Mark?

260
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,560
我会跟他说的
I'll talk to him.

261
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,450
好  那我挂了
OK, I'd better go, 

262
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,300
等细节定下来我再联系你
but I'll let you know the details once it's all set.

263
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,460
-好的  再见  -再见
- OK. Bye-bye. - Bye.

264
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,510
你是不是个漂亮的小女孩
Aren't you a beautiful little girlie?

265
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,530
你是  对吗  我知道你是
You are, aren't you? You are, I know.

266
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,710
就是这么爱动  对不对啊
Yeah. Little wriggler, aren't you?

267
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,470
-带她看风景  -对
- Showing her the sights? - Yeah.

268
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,790
告诉她法庭上发生了什么
Telling her what's happening in court.

269
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,960
她才不想听  对不对
She doesn't want to hear that! Do you, darling?

270
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,410
她当然想听  她很感兴趣
Of course she does - she's interested.

271
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,900
谁在支持我们  谁在说谎
Who's sticking up for us, who's telling lies.

272
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,820
你怎么样
How are you feeling?

273
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,790
很好  我们说过以丹尼的名义做点事情
Yeah. You know we talked about doing something in Danny's name?

274
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,940
-是的  -你怎么这个语气
- Right... - What have you got that voice on for?

275
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,970
我语气很正常
I haven't got any voice on.

276
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,430
就是有  好像你不感兴趣
Yeah, your are, like you're not interested.

277
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,640
-我们非得要谈这个  -为什么你不参加
- Do we have to talk about this? - Why won't you engage with this?

278
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,050
因为我不明白为什么
Because I don't understand why...

279
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,520
我不明白你为什么要这么做  真的
I don't understand why you need to do it, I don't, I really don't.

280
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,390
就像要揭开伤疤  让它流血
You're picking at a scab, trying to make it bleed or something.

281
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,300
-什么  -看看我们的女儿
- What? - Look at what we've got here.

282
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,720
你也知道  转眼她就长大了
You know what it's like, she'll be grown up before we know it

283
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,090
我不想再错过
and I don't want to miss that again.

284
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,670
我想每时每刻都陪着她
I want to be here for her, every moment.

285
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,960
我也在陪着她  但我还想着丹尼
I'm here for her, but I can still think about Danny.

286
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,850
这是两码事  我需要这么做  马克
It's not one or the other. I need to do this. Mark.

287
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,430
好吧  我不想
Fine. I don't.

288
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,770
我们寄信给你
We sent you a letter 

289
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,440
请你做乔·米勒的品行证人
asking you to be a character witness for Joe Miller.

290
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,800
-乔真的指望着你  -我拒绝过了
- Joe is really relying on you. - I've said no.

291
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,770
乔·米勒有罪
Joe Miller is guilty.

292
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,270
他确实向你认罪了吗
Has he ever categorically confessed his guilt to you?

293
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,520
没有
No.

294
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,920
为什么不让陪审团决定
Why not let the jury decide?

295
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,740
还有  如果你确定他有罪
Besides, if you're so sure about his guilt,

296
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,440
为什么还去探视他
why have you been visiting him?

297
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,860
他告诉你了
He told you?

298
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,510
律师和委托人之间没有秘密
There are no secrets between a barrister and her client.

299
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,210
就像告解秘密
Like the Seal of the Confessional.

300
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,210
{\an8}告解秘密  向神父忏悔时说话  神父都会保密

301
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,420
我去探视他
I went to see him 

302
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,370
是因为我坚信宽恕和赎罪
because I believe in forgiveness and redemption.

303
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,490
我希望他能悔过  可自从你出现
I hoped to find a repentant man, but since you showed up

304
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,030
这好像不可能了
that seems to have gone out the window.

305
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,580
丹尼葬礼上你做了礼拜  对吗
You gave the service at Danny's funeral, didn't you?

306
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,000
是的
I did.

307
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,530
拉蒂默夫妇知道你曾探视过乔吗
Do the Latimers know you've been visiting Joe?

308
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,820
-这是干什么  轮流审问吗  -听着
- What is this? Bad cop, bad cop? - Look...

309
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,350
我懂了  你不想作证
I get it. You don't want to give evidence,

310
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,130
因为你怕拉蒂默夫妇觉得被背叛了
because you're worried the Latimers will feel betrayed.

311
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,590
不  绝不是这样
No, that is not it!

312
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,260
世人都犯了罪  亏缺了神的荣耀
"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

313
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,050
罗马书3:23
Romans 3.23.

314
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,650
不只有你按时做礼拜  牧师
You are not the only churchgoer here, Reverend.

315
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,280
你教区的一位信徒身陷囹圄
Now, a member of your parish is in crisis.

316
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,550
你真的要在危难关头抛弃他吗
Are you really going to desert him in his hour of need?

317
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,570
再想想  好吗
Have another think about it, would you?

318
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,370
我喜欢你的教堂
I like your church.

319
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,670
看吧  出来走走有好处
See? It's good to get out.

320
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,480
你待在死人旁边的时间太多了
You spend way too much time around dead people.

321
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,900
是要我继续自言自语
Shall I just keep talking

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,510
还是你能和我说说话
or are you going to join in at some point?

323
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,740
贝卡  有件事我要告诉你
Becca, there's something I want to tell you.

324
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,850
我去监狱探视过乔·米勒
I've been visiting Joe Miller in prison.

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,170
和他一起祈祷过
Praying with him.

326
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,510
你开玩笑呢吧
You're kidding.

327
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,340
我以为我能拯救他
I thought I could save him.

328
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,260
我以为他会悔过
I thought he was repentant.

329
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,920
悔过  开庭时你不在场吗
Repentant? Have you not been at the trial?!

330
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,040
贝卡  我觉得我犯了一个错误
Becca, I think I've made a mistake.

331
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,570
我必须找人倾诉
I just needed to tell someone.

332
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,290
说话啊
Say something.

333
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
你让我感觉  我也参与了
I feel like you've made me a part of it.

334
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,860
我把这些文件的录音发给你了
I sent you those audio files of those documents read onto tape.

335
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,250
很好  我要你把这些录成语音
Oh good. Now, I need you to read and record these as well.

336
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,370
-什么  -还有这些
- What? - And...these.

337
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,110
以及这些
And these.

338
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,580
拜托了
Please?

339
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,880
-我做不到  -你必须做
- I can't! - Well, you have to.

340
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,180
乔瑟琳  我还有很多事要做
Jocelyn I have far too much else to do. 

341
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,390
那就干活麻利点
Well, then, work faster!

342
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,360
不行  你自己读不行吗
No! Read your own documents.

343
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,550
我可不要熬夜到凌晨三点念文件
I'm not sitting up to 3.00am reading aloud

344
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,940
好让你坐着闭眼听
so you can sit back with your eyes closed.

345
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,200
我不能这么工作  你真是个噩梦
I can't work like this! You're a bloody nightmare.

346
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,850
我要回家陪家人了
I'm going home to see my family.

347
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,170
明天法庭见
I'll see you tomorrow at court.

348
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,970
别这么看我
Don't give me that look!

349
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,040
-你听到多少  -足够了
- How much did you hear? - Enough.

350
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,640
你还没告诉他  对吗
You haven't told him, have you?

351
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,500

I think this is brilliant!

353
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,330
当时你知道家后面要建这个吗

354
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,500
签约时房屋出租公司忘了提
The rental company forgot to mention it when I took it on.

没必要  瑞奇  这对谁都没好处

439
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,430
事情曾经很复杂  我让其变得尤为复杂
Things were complicated and I made... I made them more so.

440
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,090
当时  我本应该强大一点的
I was at a point when I, when I should have been strong

441
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,890
但我没有
and I wasn't,

442
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,710
我错了本应共度一生的那个人
and I missed the person I was supposed to be with.

443
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,590
你有告诉过他吗
Did you ever tell him?

444
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,540
没有
No.

445
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,610
也许你应该告诉他
Maybe you should.

446
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,490
事后意识到错误很容易
It's always easy to recognise mistakes in hindsight.

447
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,690
要解决起来可就难多了
Much harder to fix them now.

448
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,320
你为何要现在立遗嘱
Anyway, why do you... why do you need this now?

449
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,090
做我该做的
Just putting things right.

450
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,420
你如何看待审判
What's your sense of the trial?

451
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,010
苏珊·怀特对辩方不利
Susan Wright was a mistake for the defence.

452
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,990
让他们看起来很不专业
It makes them look like amateurs.

453
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,890
不出席证人席作证
Not going into the witness

454
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,420
将有损米勒的可信度
box is going to damage Miller's credibility.

455
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,760
一定要给他定罪
He has got to be convicted.

456
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,770
用不着你告诉我
I don't need you to tell me that!

457
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,470
我会竭尽所能的
I'll do the best I can with what I have.

458
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,750
她怎么还不睡  都喂了两顿了
Why won't she sleep? She's had two feeds.

459
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,140
给我吧  来
Give her to me, come on.

460
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,040
交给我吧  你回去睡
I've got her. You go back to bed.

461
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,070
乖
That's it.

462
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,540
乖  乖
That's it, that's it.

463
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,700
嘘  我知道
Shh. I know.

464
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,410
我们该拿你怎么办呢  小麻烦
What are we going to do with you? Troubling.

465
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,860
你这大喊大闹的把大家都吵醒了
You're making all that racket and waking everyone up.

466
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,420
我们该拿你怎么办呢
What are we going to do with you?

467
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,050
看见这个了吗
Did you see this scribbled

468
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,110
一张旧的车辆检查表背面的潦草字迹
on the back of an old vehicle check form?

469
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,800
索普乡镇农业服务
Thorp Agriservices. 

470
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,050
那是什么  你有看见过吗
What's that? Have you come across that?

471
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,380
接着是加里·索普  连字符  李·阿什沃斯  问号
And next to it, Gary Thorp, Dash, Lee Ashworth, question mark.

472
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,970
-你一整晚都在这吗  -我想是的
- Have you been here all night? - Yeah, I suppose I have.

473
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,690
弗雷德在隔壁睡着呢  嘘
Fred is sleeping next door. Shh! 

474
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,050
我要喝杯茶
I need a cup of tea.

475
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,660
你的茶包和牛奶都没了
Ah, you're out of teabags and milk

476
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,480
最后一点面包也被我吃了
and I've used the last of the bread.

477
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,820
我没找到任何
I couldn't find any note of Thorp Agriservices

478
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,440
复查索普乡镇农业服务的记录
ever being cross-checked.

479
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,970
我好像没听说过这个名字
I don't think I've ever heard of it.

480
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,650
我还看了一遍李·阿什沃斯给你的资料
Plus, I went through that stuff Lee Ashworth gave you.

481
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,340
要么没用  要么无关
It's all useless or irrelevant.

482
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,050
他只是想转移我们的视线
He's just trying to put us off the scent.

483
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,230
你对丽莎·纽伯瑞调查了多少
How far did you ever look into Lisa Newbery? 

484
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,550
什么意思
How do you mean?

485
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,890
丽莎最后使用银行账户的时间
The last use of Lisa's bank account

486
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,570
是她失踪那天下午3点54分
was at 3:54 pm on the day she disappeared

487
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,980
在她去做保姆之前
before she went to babysit.

488
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,390
最后一条通话记录是在
The last call was made at 5:17 pm

489
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,640
晚上5点17分从手机打给她妈妈
on her mobile to her mum.

490
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,660
之后便再没取钱或是通话了
Then no more cash withdrawals or calls made after that,

491
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,230
但她的手机却一直开机18小时
but her phone was on for another 18 hours.

492
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,800
最后的定位地点在朴茨茅斯
The last signal triangulated in Portsmouth.

493
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,360
她的手机怎么跑到朴茨茅斯去了
How the hell did her phone get to Portsmouth?

494
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,780
当时有嫌疑人住在朴茨茅斯附近吗
Were any of our suspects near Portsmouth then?

495
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,170
没有  我们查过了  这些我们都知道
No, we checked. We know all this.

496
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,420
我的想法是这样的
OK, here's the thing.

497
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,490
丽莎失手杀死了皮帕
Lisa killed Pippa by accident.

498
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,020
处理了尸体逃跑了
Got rid of the body and went on the run.

499
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,620
凶手是她  而且她还活着
She did that and she's still alive.

500
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,410
你得承认  有这种可能
You've got to admit, it's a possibility.

501
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,400
-准备好了吗  -好了
- You ready? - Yeah

502
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,340
走吧
Come on.

503
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,670
你是检方的反驳证人
You're a prosecution rebuttal witness.

504
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,090
你的作用是反驳辩方的一部分观点
You are there specifically to rebut part of the defence case.

505
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,570
你好  卡特先生  当晚有人跟你在一起吗
Hello, Mr Carter. Was anyone with you that night?

506
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,880
没有
No.

507
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,400
-有人看到你了吗  -没有
- Did anyone see you? - No.

508
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,980
所以没人能证实你的说法
So, nobody can corroborate your story?

509
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,220
只有我煮熟的野鸡能证明
Only the pheasants I poached.

510
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,820
你觉得这好玩吗  卡特先生
Is this funny to you, Mr Carter?

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,720
不好玩
Not at all.

512
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,540
你的亲生母亲指认你出现在丹尼的尸体旁
Your own mother identified you with Danny's body, didn't she?

513
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,870
如果是我杀了丹尼
If I killed Danny,

514
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,800
那他身上应该有我的DNA吧
then where is my DNA on him, 'ey?

515
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,620
小屋里也没有我的指纹吧
Where are my prints at the hut?

516
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,400
谁说是你杀了丹尼
Who said you killed him?

517
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,430
我可没有暗示说是你杀了丹尼
I'm not suggesting you killed Danny.

518
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,180
我暗示的是你将他的尸体放到了海滩上
I am suggesting that you put his body on the beach

519
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,860
并且被苏珊·怀特看到了
where Susan Wright saw you.

520
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,820
-是这样吗  -不是
- Isn't that correct? - No!

521
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

522
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,320
伙计
Mate...

523
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,700
出什么事了
What happened?

524
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,250
告诉我到底怎么回事
Tell me what it was about.

525
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,740
有目击证人吗
Were there witnesses?

526
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,570
他们知道是谁下的手吗  有人为此受罚吗
Do they know who did this? Is someone being punished for this?

527
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,180
你现在受到应有的保护了吗
Are you getting proper protection now?

528
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,840
乔纳  说话啊
Jonah, say something!

529
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,290
从我小时候你就说"我是你妈妈
Ever since I was a boy you said, "I'm your mum.

530
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,890
告诉我  我来帮你搞定"
Tell me, and I'll make it all right."

531
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,500
那你怎么不能救我出去
Why can't you get me out of here?

532
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,970
不  这不是你的错  你已经尽力了
No, it's not your fault. You did your best.

533
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,410
好了  别担心了  明天见
All right, stop worrying now. I'll see you tomorrow.

534
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,240
再见
Yeah, bye.

535
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,620
是奈杰打来的  他...
That was Nige. He's er...

536
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,580
今天的事让他很难过
He's all torn up about today.

537
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,400
我告诉他我们不担心  他也不用担心
I told him we weren't worried, so he shouldn't be.

538
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,590
贝丝
Beth?

539
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,440
可我担心
I do worry, though.

540
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,380
我担心陪审团会相信她
I worry the jury will believe her.

541
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,640
我担心已有的事实不够定他的罪
I worry the truth won't be enough.

542
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,280
{\an8}索普乡镇农业服务

543
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,610
{\an8}索普乡镇农业服务

544
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,560
{\an8}你查过他之前跟谁在一起了吗

545
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:31,960
怎么了
What?

546
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,710
你告诉瑞奇·吉莱斯皮我在哪工作了吗
Did you tell Ricky Gillespie where I was working?

547
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,180
没有  怎么了
No, why?

548
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,410
因为他来找我了
Because he's come for me.

549
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,620
给你
Here you go.

550
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,690
见鬼
Oh, shit!

551
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,620
瑞奇  住手  瑞奇
Ricky, get off him! Ricky!

552
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,440
快住手  别打了
Get off him. Come on!

553
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,120
你觉得这有用吗
Do you think that will help?

554
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,140
我就是来打他的
I got what I came for.

555
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,350
一无是处的混蛋
You're nothing!

556
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,710
你要报案吗
Are you going to report it?

557
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,900
不了  报案有用吗
No, what's the point?

558
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,180
你就睡在这吗
Is this where you're sleeping?

559
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,790
农场主说可以
The farmer said I could.

560
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,310
我喜欢
I like it.

561
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,990
我听说你见了克莱尔
I hear you saw Claire.

562
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,890
是吗
Did you?

563
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,540
你们俩用过氟硝安定[催眠药]吗
You two ever use Rohypnol?

564
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,420
-用过一次  -从哪弄到的
- Once. - Where did you get it from?

565
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,360
瑞奇·吉莱斯皮
Ricky Gillespie.

566
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,320
他去过阿姆斯特丹
He used to go to Amsterdam,

567
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,940
带回来了各种各样的东西
bring back all sorts of stuff.

568
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,910
-瑞奇给了你氟硝安定[催眠药]  -没错
- Ricky gave you Rohypnol? - He did.

569
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,490
你听说过一家叫索普乡镇农业服务的公司吗
Have you ever heard of a business called Thorp Agriservices?

570
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,370
没有
No.

571
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,660
你确定吗
You sure about that?

572
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,490
除非凯特帮它做过账
Unless it's one of the businesses Cate did the books for.

573
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,360
你跟凯特睡过吗
Did you ever sleep with Cate?

574
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,310
-妈妈再见  -再见  宝贝  一天愉快
- Bye, Mum! - Bye, sweetheart. Have a great day.

575
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,220
没有
No.

576
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,310
辩方想让陪审团相信是我杀了丹
The defence want the jury to believe that I killed Dan.

577
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,770
然后找奈杰销毁尸体
Got Nige to dispose of the body.

578
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,750
他们就是这么打算的
That's clearly where they're going.

579
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,440
我曾读过一个经历这种的事的家庭
I was reading about another family.

580
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,310
他们说审判
They were saying the trial

581
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,990
跟谋杀一样恐怖  我还想着
was as bad as the murder and I thought,

582
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,230
"他们说的不对"
"That can't be right."

583
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,750
可我现在每天走进法庭
Then going in every day,

584
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,770
眼睁睁地看着我们的生活被打乱...
seeing our lives get turned inside out...

585
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,680
而我们只是很爱我们的儿子
when all we did was love our son.

586
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,340
我终于体会到了
I get it.

587
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,680
你想让我作为证人出庭  对吧
You want me to go in the witness box, don't you?

588
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,990
说实话吗  我很纠结
Honestly? I'm torn.

589

丹尼被杀的那晚
There's an hour missing in your account

590
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,160
你有一个小时的时间不知去向
the night Danny was killed.

591
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,260
你不用保护我  乔瑟琳
You don't need to protect me, Jocelyn

592
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,110
你自己也说过得有人为丹站出来
You said yourself somebody needs to speak up for Dan. Well...

593
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,680
我是他爸爸  这是我应该做的
I'm his dad. It should be down to me, you know.

594
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,370

595
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,390

They're here.

596
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,600
是的  他们跟小组的领导在里面

597
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,230
为什么我又要见一次
Why am I doing this again?

598
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,950
可能这太快了
Maybe this is too soon.

599
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,450
不不不  我可以  我能面对他们
No, no, no, I can do it. I can face them.

600
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,210
什么事
What?

601
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,520
你好啊  你好像走错房间了
Hello. I think you're in the wrong room.

602
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,170
我是汤姆·米勒
I'm Tom Miller.

603

乔·米勒是我爸爸
Joe Miller is my dad.

604
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,090
可不是  我没认出来
Of course you are. I didn't recognise you.

605
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,960
-你来这干什么  -你们为什么不让我出庭
- What are you doing here? - Why don't you call me in court?

606
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,710
我想去作证
I want to give evidence.

607
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,610
早上好
Good morning.

608
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,050
-你刚才说什么  -早上好
- What did you say?! - Good morning.

609
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,430
正常人不都这么说吗
Isn't that what people normally say?

610
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,870
你竟然跟我说正常人...
You talk about being normal...

611
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,590
这是我儿子  你看看监狱的人对他做了什么
That's my son! That's what they've done to him in prison!

612
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,590
这事你怪不得我
Don't you dare make this my responsibility.

613
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,480
对啊  因为你不食人间烟火  对吧
Of course not! Life doesn't touch you, does it?

614
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,380
好了  莎伦
All right, Sharon. 

615
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,850
我劳心劳力地为你工作了七年
Seven years I took shit from you!

616
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,970
七年啊
Seven years,

617
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,240
我唯一一次求你办件事
and the one time I ask you for anything,

618
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,860
你却不理不问
you don't raise a finger.

619
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,370
我为什么总要帮你收拾乱摊子
Why should I be always mopping up your mess?

620
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,210
-什么  -你为我工作的那段时间
- What?! - All the time you worked for me.

621
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,460
总在说你是个可怜的单身母亲
All those 'poor me single mother' speeches.

622
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,890
别怪在我身上  都是你一手造成的
Don't put this on me! It's down to you and no-one else.

623
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,750
你知道做母亲是什么感觉吗
What would you know about being a mother?

624
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,560
你连个人都不算
You're barely bloody human!

625
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,230
你儿子害死了一个人
A man died because of your boy.

626
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,930
是的  可他当时是在帮助别人
Yes, he was trying to help someone in trouble.

627
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,520
这句辩词说了多少遍了
Haven't we heard that defence before

628
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,280
你当时为什么不接他的案子
Why didn't you take his case?

629
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,700
因为我不够喜欢你
Because I didn't like you enough...

630
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,770
而且我就知道如果你输了会怪我
and I always knew you would blame me if you lost,

631
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,890
因为你一直都这样
because that's what you always did.

632
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,210
每次你输了案子
Every time you didn't win,

633
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,600
每次忘了重要论点
every time you missed out on a big brief,

634
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,180
你总是怪罪别人
you always blame someone else.

635
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,350
我原来对你期望很高
I had such high expectations of you.

636
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,980
你不应该再重新工作  乔瑟琳
You should have stayed retired, Jocelyn,

637
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,250
因为这次我会让你一败涂地
because I'm going to see that you leave that court a failure.

638
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,950
索普乡镇农业服务

639
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,020

640

距离吉莱斯皮家五英里

I could see where you found Pippa and the woods by the river.

换个视角  就像你所期望的
Fresh eyes - that's what you wanted.

644
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,680
终于找到你了  你怎么不接电话
There you are! Don't you answer your phone?

645
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,700
我在满世界找你
I've been looking all over for you.

646
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,020
这是些什么破东西
What the hell is all that stuff?

647
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,410
不好意思  这可是我家
Excuse me. This is my house!

648
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,150

What do you want, Lucy?

649
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,460
我只是想告诉你我不知道他那么做了
I just want you to know I didn't know he'd done it.

650
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,870
不知道他做什么了
Didn't know he'd done what?

Tom is going to give evidence on behalf of Joe.

652

什么
What?

653
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,280
他背着我去见了乔的律师
He went to see Joe's legal team without my knowing.

654
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,380
没有我的允许他不能出庭  对吧
He can't do that without my permission, can he?

655
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,550
显然不是的
Apparently, he can.

656
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,000
我劝过他  可他下定决心了  艾
I tried to talk him out of it, but he's dead set on it, Elle.

657
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,990
-艾  -走吧  露西  快走吧

660
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,770

661
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,490
-继续  告诉我吧  -可以坐船去法国

00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,740
不像是跟李·阿什沃斯有关的地方
It doesn't seem like a place Lee Ashworth would be connected to.

669
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,100
他有什么在瞒着我们呢
So, what is he not telling us?

670
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,560
好像关门很久了
It looks pretty closed.

671
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,740
肯定是不干了
It must have gone out of business.

什么味道
What's that smell?

676
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,310
是血
It's blood!

677

那是什么
What is that?!

678
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,350
看好了
Oh, look, here you go.

679
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,970
天哪  是个熔炉
Oh, God. It's a furnace.

680
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,510
农业服务  他们在这里焚烧死牲畜
