15
00:02:57,430 > 00:02:59,850
你告诉我你是因为我才留在女妖镇的
You told me you stayed in Banshee because of me.

16
00:02:59,850 > 00:03:01,640
我要确认你平安无事
I had to make sure you were okay.

17
00:03:05,180 > 00:03:06,340
我有事
I'm not.

18
00:03:11,410 > 00:03:12,520
听着
Hey, listen.

19
00:03:20,460 > 00:03:23,340
被枪指着你好像一点都不惊讶
You don't seem surprised to have a gun in your face.

20
00:03:25,050 > 00:03:28,080
这说明你一直都过着小心警惕的日子
That's a symptom of a life spent looking over your shoulder.

21
00:03:29,130 > 00:03:30,260
你是谁?
Who are you?

22
00:03:31,030 > 00:03:33,660
我是特别探员罗伯特·菲利普斯
I'm Special Agent Robert Phillips,

23
00:03:33,660 > 00:03:36,280
联邦调查局内部调查组
FBI Internal Investigations.

24
00:03:40,780 > 00:03:42,890
我都不知道联调局里有内部事物
I didn't realize the FBI had internal affairs.

25
00:03:42,890 > 00:03:44,870
那是因为你不是真正的警察
That's because you're not really a cop.

26
00:03:45,320 > 00:03:49,080
不过我们接下来有大把的时间好好聊
But we'll have plenty of time to talk about all that later.

27
00:03:49,080 > 00:03:50,750
你为什么不先穿好衣服?
Why don't you get dressed?

28
00:04:07,350 > 00:04:08,900
很久以前
There was a time

29
00:04:09,550 > 00:04:13,140
是我站在床边凝视你的睡颜
when I was the one who would watch you sleep.

30
00:04:14,620 > 00:04:18,500
你是这样一个漂亮的孩子
You were such a beautiful child

31
00:04:19,600 > 00:04:22,430
有着光辉的前景
with so much promise.

32
00:04:23,960 > 00:04:26,590
我从来没想让你失望  母亲
It was never my intention to disappoint you, Mother.

33
00:04:27,200 > 00:04:30,050
凯
Oh, Kai.

34
00:04:30,630 > 00:04:33,490
我不会对你失望的
You could never disappoint me.

35
00:04:34,310 > 00:04:37,240
我只是希望我能相信
I just wish I could believe

36
00:04:37,950 > 00:04:39,890
你得到了满足
you were content.

37
00:04:44,000 > 00:04:46,040
谁还会爱你呢  凯？
Who will love you, Kai?

38
00:04:47,360 > 00:04:49,360
你还会爱谁呢？
Who will you love?

39
00:04:49,670 > 00:04:50,840
普罗科特先生？
Mr. Proctor?

40
00:05:00,610 > 00:05:03,050
我  我只是想确认你没事
I I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

41
00:05:05,930 > 00:05:09,400
你要保证  我离开之后......
Promise me after I am gone...

42
00:05:11,350 > 00:05:15,130
你会让丽贝卡搬出去
that you will move Rebecca out of this house.

43
00:05:16,850 > 00:05:20,760
这不合适  这不健康
It's not proper. It's not healthy.

44
00:05:23,870 > 00:05:25,330
你保证
Promise me.

45
00:05:31,230 > 00:05:33,200
我不该扔下她的
I should never have left her.

46
00:05:35,430 > 00:05:37,460
我不该把她扔在农场里
I should never have left her on the farm

47
00:05:38,960 > 00:05:40,220
和我父亲一起
with my father.

48
00:05:42,470 > 00:05:43,480
没事的
It's okay.

49
00:05:51,350 > 00:05:54,290
她需要我  这些年来  她需要......
She needed me. All those years, she needed...

50
00:05:54,290 > 00:05:55,780
她还是需要你
She still needs you.

51
00:05:57,550 > 00:05:59,090
而你就在她身边
And you're here for her.

52
00:07:30,710 > 00:07:31,740
你好
Hi there.

53
00:07:36,150 > 00:07:37,610
知道吗
You know,

54
00:07:38,040 > 00:07:40,590
听说通过一个人的家
they say a man's home is

55
00:07:40,890 > 00:07:43,670
就能了解这个人的心
a window into his mind.

56
00:07:45,130 > 00:07:46,550
是  我听过
Yeah, I've heard that.

57
00:07:53,730 > 00:07:55,180
格洛克17
Glock 17.

58
00:07:57,170 > 00:07:58,290
9毫米口径
9 mil.

59
00:07:58,690 > 00:07:59,920
真的吗?
Really?

60
00:08:00,330 > 00:08:01,300
对
Yeah.

61
00:08:02,430 > 00:08:03,950
它能让我完成工作
Gets the job done.

62
00:08:05,430 > 00:08:07,350
你应该了解我的几件事
You should know some things about me.

63
00:08:07,770 > 00:08:09,800
我的上司要求结果
My superiors demand results,

64
00:08:09,800 > 00:08:12,060
但他们最不关心我是怎么得来的
but they're not in the least concerned how I achieve them.

65
00:08:12,060 > 00:08:15,210
所以如果我是你
So if I were you, 

66
00:08:15,210 > 00:08:18,040
我会加强警觉
I would exercise some caution.

67
00:08:18,040 > 00:08:21,790
如果我是你  也一样
And if I were you, I'd do the same.

68
00:08:21,790 > 00:08:22,740
同意
Agreed.

69
00:08:23,930 > 00:08:25,240
为什么不戴上它们呢？
Why don't you put those on?

70
00:08:31,260 > 00:08:33,740
你就是普罗科特的看门恶犬
So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog.

71
00:08:34,580 > 00:08:37,110
从我这看  你也没有多凶
You don't look so tough from where I'm standing.

72
00:08:38,670 > 00:08:40,250
计划是这样的
So here's the plan.

73
00:08:41,420 > 00:08:44,010
首先  我会杀了你
First, I'm gonna kill you.

74
00:08:44,160 > 00:08:47,620
然后我要进去慢慢折磨死你老板
Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss

75
00:08:47,620 > 00:08:49,830
和他那《草原小屋》里的侄女
and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.

76
00:08:50,760 > 00:08:52,240
我不这么想
I don't think so.

77
00:12:48,730 > 00:12:49,670
诺拉
Nola.

78
00:12:50,450 > 00:12:52,310
让我死
Let me die.

79
00:12:52,790 > 00:12:54,280
你已经死了
You already did.

80
00:12:54,980 > 00:12:56,990
是重生的时候了
It's time to start living again.

81
00:13:47,990 > 00:13:50,140
数据回收器是什么玩意
What the hell is a data skimmer?

82
00:13:50,140 > 00:13:51,840
物如其名
Exactly what it sounds like.

83
00:13:51,850 > 00:13:55,340
它会扫描并储存从编码智能卡得来的元数据
It scans and saves metadata from encoded smart cards.

84
00:13:58,370 > 00:14:01,200
我们从他们那窃取真实身份信息
We stealing real IDs from them

85
00:14:01,200 > 00:14:04,680
然后我就能给我们做假的用了
so I can make fake IDs for us.

86
00:14:05,560 > 00:14:06,760
早这么说不就完了
That's all you had to say.

87
00:14:06,760 > 00:14:08,330
费那劲干嘛  现在干嘛？
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

88
00:14:08,330 > 00:14:10,500
天知道这事从不简单
Lord knows it ain't ever easy.

89
00:14:11,650 > 00:14:13,630
这个给你  现在要让你
This one's yours. Now, I want you to

90
00:14:13,630 > 00:14:14,980
测试！
Testing!

91
00:14:16,690 > 00:14:17,730
好用
It works.

92
00:14:19,610 > 00:14:21,800
努力点  别给我搞砸了
Do your best not to fuck this up.

93
00:14:59,980 > 00:15:02,120
这周都三次了
That is the third time this week.

94
00:15:02,140 > 00:15:03,860
他们这是要干嘛？
You think they're trying to tell me something?

95
00:15:13,570 > 00:15:14,760
我需要六个身份信息
I need six IDs.

96
00:15:14,760 > 00:15:17,280
数的时候别动嘴
Try not to move your lips while you're counting.

97
00:15:25,610 > 00:15:27,240
好了  我该去取下来了
Okay, I got to grab it.

98
00:15:28,150 > 00:15:29,560
不行  还差三个
Mmmmm, three more.

99
00:15:32,010 > 00:15:33,410
没时间了
Running out of time.

100
00:15:38,310 > 00:15:39,270
还差一个
One more.

101
00:15:41,530 > 00:15:43,090
我的一串钥匙
Oh, I had some keys

102
00:15:43,090 > 00:15:45,030
原来在这
Oh, there they are.

103
00:15:45,040 > 00:15:47,160
还差一个  谢谢
 One more.  Thank you.

104
00:15:47,800 > 00:15:49,310
够了  出来吧
I got it. Get your ass out.

105
00:15:49,520 > 00:15:50,780
我有个很重要的商谈
I got a big business meeting

106
00:15:50,780 > 00:15:53,320
钥匙丢了就去不了了
and I can't get nowhere without these keys

107
00:15:53,320 > 00:15:54,810
太感谢了
Thank you so much.

108
00:16:07,000 > 00:16:07,900
咋了？
What?

109
00:16:09,290 > 00:16:11,950
既然我们不用过大厅
If we were never going past the lobby,

110
00:16:12,050 > 00:16:14,370
你干嘛让我穿一身西装
why you got me wearing this damn suit?

111
00:16:14,530 > 00:16:17,660
因为没有休闲星期一的说法
'Cause there ain't no such thing as sweatpants Monday.

112
00:16:19,820 > 00:16:21,130
开车啊
You can drive.

113
00:16:49,970 > 00:16:51,330
我喜欢经典摇滚
You know, I prefer classic rock,

114
00:16:51,330 > 00:16:52,720
但是乡村音乐
but something about country music 

115
00:16:52,720 > 00:16:54,590
让人身心舒畅  不觉得吗
that soothes the soul, don't you think?

116
00:16:54,590 > 00:16:55,930
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

117
00:16:57,580 > 00:17:00,260
我在局里有一项专门的工作
You know, I have a rather specialized job at the Bureau.

118
00:17:00,260 > 00:17:03,410
我是个问题处理者
I'm a fixer of sorts,

119
00:17:03,410 > 00:17:06,330
我调查死亡及失踪的探员
so I investigate dead and missing agents.

120
00:17:06,410 > 00:17:10,380
当然  失踪的那些基本上也都死了
Of course, the missing ones almost always turn out to be dead, too.

121
00:17:10,710 > 00:17:12,210
比如吉姆·拉辛
Like Jim Racine?

122
00:17:13,230 > 00:17:15,010
然而我在纽约州北部的
Instead I found his body

123
00:17:15,010 > 00:17:17,570
一间旧农舍外面找到了他的尸体
outside an old farmhouse in upstate New York.

124
00:17:17,660 > 00:17:18,680
是吗
Really?

125
00:17:18,790 > 00:17:21,630
他尸体的一部分吧
Well, what was left of him.

126
00:17:21,350 > 00:17:23,570
{\an8}罗伯特·菲利普斯探员

127
00:17:21,710 > 00:17:23,670
他被烧得很惨
He was burned up pretty bad.

128
00:17:24,980 > 00:17:27,790
杀了他的混蛋却没事
But not the slug that killed him.

129
00:17:28,790 > 00:17:31,000
九毫米口径格洛克
Glock 9 mil?

130
00:17:32,480 > 00:17:33,540
不是
No.

131
00:17:33,920 > 00:17:35,840
点308来复枪
.308 rifle round.

132
00:17:36,860 > 00:17:38,380
挺有意思啊
Isn't that interesting?

133
00:17:40,280 > 00:17:41,320
他手里那份
Not as interesting as the

134
00:17:41,320 > 00:17:44,090
关于你的厚厚的档案才更有趣
inchthick file that he was keeping on you.

135
00:17:44,600 > 00:17:46,590
原来纽约市警察局的
You know, it turns out that the NYPD's

136
00:17:46,590 > 00:17:48,620
匿名钻石大盗
John Doe Capital Diamond thief

137
00:17:48,630 > 00:17:50,380
竟然是宾夕法尼亚州
turned out to be the new sheriff

138
00:17:50,380 > 00:17:54,440
女妖镇的新警长
of Banshee, Pennsylvania?

139
00:17:55,590 > 00:17:56,920
太跳跃了
That's quite a leap.

140
00:17:56,930 > 00:18:00,110
大概吧  但这件事越发有趣了
Maybe, but the story gets better.

141
00:18:00,560 > 00:18:02,610
尤其是在教堂
Especially the part about the church,

142
00:18:02,700 > 00:18:03,930
火拼那部分
the gunfight.

143
00:18:05,080 > 00:18:06,630
要超级有种
I mean, it takes some kingsized balls

144
00:18:06,630 > 00:18:09,220
才敢用那种方式干掉兔子吧
to take on a guy like Rabbit in a way like that.

145
00:18:09,420 > 00:18:12,720
当我想到前科犯冒充警长时
And when I think about an excon posing as a sheriff,

146
00:18:12,720 > 00:18:17,770
我想也许这两个有种的家伙是同一人
well, I think maybe those are the same big balls.

147
00:18:19,980 > 00:18:21,680
我受宠若惊
Well, I'm flattered,

148
00:18:22,220 > 00:18:23,850
但你只是在浪费时间
but you're wasting your time.

149
00:18:27,200 > 00:18:30,050
你很了解浪费时间这回事  对吧
You know something about wasted time, don't you?

150
00:18:31,200 > 00:18:32,530
我不理解  我是说
I don't get it. I mean,

151
00:18:32,620 > 00:18:34,430
你出来后随便去哪儿都行
you could have gone anywhere when you got out.

152
00:18:34,430 > 00:18:37,690
你可以找个天堂般的黑沙滩
You could have found a black sand beach somewhere in paradise,

153
00:18:37,690 > 00:18:40,520
找个淡棕色美女夜夜笙歌
a new golden brown senorita every night of the week.

154
00:18:40,520 > 00:18:42,530
天哪  要我我就这么干
My God, that's what I would have done.

155
00:18:42,530 > 00:18:45,610
但你偏不  你跑来了女妖镇
Oh, not you. No. You came to Banshee.

156
00:18:45,610 > 00:18:47,110
你在偷走你十五年光阴的
You played dressup right down the road

157
00:18:47,120 > 00:18:50,470
女人家街头玩起了变装
from the woman who stole 15 years of your life.

158
00:18:51,430 > 00:18:54,690
她肯定很厉害
She must be something.

159
00:18:55,590 > 00:18:57,410
要不然就是你内心深处
Or else there's something inside of you

160
00:18:57,410 > 00:18:59,420
还想被惩罚
that still wants to be punished.

161
00:19:01,880 > 00:19:03,210
你怎么看？
What do you think?

162
00:19:04,500 > 00:19:06,670
我觉得你话太多
I think you talk too much.

163
00:19:08,670 > 00:19:11,220
我第三任前妻也是这么说的
That's what my third exwife told me.

164
00:19:18,650 > 00:19:20,270
好了  出来
Okay, get out.

165
00:19:20,910 > 00:19:21,790
你要放我走？
You're letting me go?

166
00:19:21,790 > 00:19:24,410
不  我放你出来撒尿
No, I'm letting you take a piss.

167
00:19:24,550 > 00:19:25,770
回市里还有很长一段路
It's a long way back to the city.

168
00:19:25,770 > 00:19:27,060
中途不会再停车了
We're not gonna stop another time.

169
00:19:27,060 > 00:19:30,060
我不用  我没问你  出来
 I'm good.  I'm not asking. Move.

170
00:19:30,160 > 00:19:31,930
敢乱来的话  知道  你就开枪
 And if you try anything  Yeah, you'll shoot me.

171
00:19:31,930 > 00:19:33,380
我懂的  对  出来
 I get it.  Yeah. Come on.

172
00:19:43,740 > 00:19:44,820
你知道吗?
Hey, you know what?

173
00:19:46,000 > 00:19:48,300
我改变主意了  怎么说?
 I think I changed my mind.  How's that?

174
00:19:48,300 > 00:19:50,440
我不想回纽约
Well, I don't think I want to go back to New York.

175
00:19:51,840 > 00:19:53,410
说得好像你有的选一样
You make it sound like you have a choice.

176
00:19:53,410 > 00:19:56,540
选择总会有的
Well, there's always a choice.

177
00:20:20,340 > 00:20:22,320
我想举报一起抢劫案
I want to report a robbery in progress

178
00:20:22,320 > 00:20:24,350
在钻石仓库
at the Capital Diamond warehouse.

00:20:24,350 > 00:20:26,280
锯木厂河畔路211号

181
00:20:28,620 > 00:20:30,370
我是朱利亚斯·邦纳警探

182
00:20:30,370 > 00:20:33,040
今晚是我的人把你们扣下的
It was my team that took you down tonight.

183
00:20:33,290 > 00:20:34,080
恭喜
Congratulations.

185
00:20:34,080 > 00:20:35,950
你很聪明  应该知道
You are smart enough to know

186
00:20:35,950 > 00:20:38,540
设圈套的人是你的老板
that whoever you're working for set you up.

187
00:21:20,300 > 00:21:21,230
我可以吗？
May I?

188
00:22:40,960 > 00:22:43,750
你等人的时候要喝点什么吗？
May I offer you something to drink while you wait?

189
00:22:47,440 > 00:22:49,810
咖啡还是茶？
Coffee? Tea?

190
00:22:50,980 > 00:22:52,550
浓烈些的？
Something stronger?

191
00:23:18,460 > 00:23:21,240
在我看来  你已经知道
The way I see it, you know you got jail

192
00:23:21,240 > 00:23:23,000
我们已经没有谈话的必要了
on the other side of this conversation.

194
00:23:23,000 > 00:23:26,630
你已经很多年没有回家了
You aren't going home for many years.

195
00:23:36,960 > 00:23:38,800
该清醒了  混蛋
Time to wake up, asshole.

196
00:23:42,990 > 00:23:44,410
他醒了
There he is.

197
00:24:04,410 > 00:24:06,150
抱歉让你等这么久
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:24:07,400 > 00:24:12,100
但愿我的手下让你有宾至如归的感觉
Hopefully my associates have made you feel at home.

199
00:24:12,510 > 00:24:16,280
如你所见  对于我这种体型的人
As you can see, comfort is a priority

200
00:24:16,280 > 00:24:19,940
舒适是最重要的
for a man of my dimensions.

201
00:24:19,950 > 00:24:21,960
适当的旅游是必要的
Some travel is unavoidable,

202
00:24:21,960 > 00:24:24,310
但轿车  货车  飞机
but cars, vans, planes,

203
00:24:24,310 > 00:24:27,120
对我来说都是一种侮辱
they all present indignities for me.

204
00:24:28,080 > 00:24:30,650
你可以试着偶尔吃点沙拉
Well, you could try eating a salad now and then.

205
00:24:32,630 > 00:24:36,120
我认为肥胖的玩笑不该存在于我们之间
I think fat jokes are beneath us both.

206
00:24:36,190 > 00:24:37,730
这很难说
Well, that's hard to say

207
00:24:38,260 > 00:24:40,830
鉴于我不知道你他妈到底是谁
seeing as I have no idea who the fuck you are.

208
00:24:52,410 > 00:24:53,990
我的名字
My name

209
00:24:54,340 > 00:24:57,400
是雷蒙德·沃尔顿·布兰特利
is Raymond Walton Brantley.

210
00:24:59,690 > 00:25:01,260
布兰特利
Brantley, that's the guy 

211
00:25:01,260 > 00:25:02,130
你就是偷了他的钱  对吗？
you stole the money off, right?

212
00:25:02,130 > 00:25:03,900
听着  我看到了不该看到的东西
Look, I saw some shit I wasn't supposed to see.

213
00:25:03,910 > 00:25:06,360
布兰特利是个偏执的疯子
Brantley, Brantley is a paranoid fuck.

214
00:25:06,490 > 00:25:07,430
是吗？
Yes?

215
00:25:08,220 > 00:25:09,270
不是？
No?

216
00:25:10,000 > 00:25:11,520
也许？
Maybe?

217
00:25:12,630 > 00:25:15,410
对于你我唯一确定的
The only thing I know for sure about you

218
00:25:15,410 > 00:25:18,030
是你不是谁
is who you are not.

219
00:25:18,360 > 00:25:21,730
你不是卢卡斯·胡德
And you are not Lucas Hood.

220
00:25:23,440 > 00:25:24,810
对吗？
Isn't that right?

221
00:25:27,660 > 00:25:28,830
没关系
It's okay.

222
00:25:28,830 > 00:25:31,390
除了之前的一顿暴打
Despite a particularly nasty beating,

223
00:25:31,390 > 00:25:35,640
联调局老鼠小组的菲利普斯探员
Agent Phillips here of the FBI's rat squad

224
00:25:35,640 > 00:25:39,560
一直安静地像只老鼠
remained as quiet as a mouse.

225
00:25:42,090 > 00:25:44,360
杰森·胡德在哪
Where is Jason Hood?

226
00:25:45,380 > 00:25:47,520
我不知道那是谁
I have no idea who that is.

227
00:25:48,110 > 00:25:49,780
真的吗？  是的
 Really?  Yes.

228
00:25:50,950 > 00:25:51,960
不是
No.

229
00:25:52,800 > 00:25:53,840
也许
Maybe.

230
00:25:55,580 > 00:25:58,630
我，只是，他死了
I, just, he's dead.

231
00:25:59,690 > 00:26:00,800
他死了
He's dead.

232
00:26:01,480 > 00:26:02,670
他死
He's de

233
00:26:08,360 > 00:26:10,420
把杰森·胡德交给我
Give me Jason Hood

234
00:26:11,350 > 00:26:13,260
然后菲利普斯探员
and Agent Phillips

235
00:26:13,260 > 00:26:16,510
再也不会找你的麻烦
will never cause you discomfort again.

236
00:26:16,510 > 00:26:17,890
说实话
To tell you the truth,

237
00:26:18,420 > 00:26:21,160
我从没担心过菲利普斯探员的事
I've never really been worried about Agent Phillips.

238
00:26:21,160 > 00:26:22,590
所以如果你能在那找到你的生殖器
So if you can find your dick in there,

239
00:26:22,590 > 00:26:24,440
为什么不滚回去自己打飞机？
why don't you go fuck yourself?

240
00:26:26,930 > 00:26:32,000
如果我是你  我会稍微考虑一下
If I were you, I'd take a moment to consider how tenuous

241
00:26:32,000 > 00:26:35,420
你有什么讨价还价的余地
your bargaining position truly is.

242
00:26:40,230 > 00:26:41,690
也许你的女孩......
Maybe you got a girl...

243
00:26:44,420 > 00:26:49,460
独自在黑暗中等待  想知道发生了什么
alone in the dark waiting and wondering what happened.

244
00:27:22,750 > 00:27:25,300
我说过应该由我负责普罗科特家
I told you I should have handled Proctor's house.

245
00:27:25,470 > 00:27:27,400
你的机会马上就来了
You'll get your chance soon enough.

246
00:27:27,660 > 00:27:29,130
你一直这么说
That's what you keep saying.

247
00:27:29,560 > 00:27:31,900
让我去打他的七寸
Let me hit him where it hurts.

248
00:27:31,900 > 00:27:34,090
让普罗科特知道我们才是老大
Show Proctor that we're in control.

249
00:27:34,810 > 00:27:36,720
你还没准备好
You're not ready.

250
00:27:37,540 > 00:27:39,340
别让我再提醒你
Don't make me tell you again.

251
00:27:42,350 > 00:27:43,460
切顿
Chayton.

252
00:27:48,750 > 00:27:50,060
你们先出去
You guys take a walk.

253
00:27:52,490 > 00:27:53,560
汤米
Hey, Tommy.

254
00:27:57,910 > 00:27:59,930
高中后我从没这样过
I haven't been out this way since high school.

255
00:28:00,900 > 00:28:02,460
你本不该来这
You should not have come here.

256
00:28:06,330 > 00:28:08,170
你为什么偷那些枪  切顿？
Why'd you steal those guns, Chayton?

257
00:28:08,960 > 00:28:09,800
如果我不知道实情
If I didn't know any better,

258
00:28:09,800 > 00:28:11,730
我会说你是在训练军队
I'd say you were training an army.

259
00:28:12,110 > 00:28:13,730
不过那就太疯狂了  不是吗？
But that would be crazy, right?

260
00:28:14,990 > 00:28:16,090
疯狂
Crazy.

261
00:28:17,540 > 00:28:20,400
疯狂是让居留地
Crazy is allowing the reservation

262
00:28:20,400 > 00:28:22,640
变得和外界一样腐朽堕落
to become as corrupt as the outside world.

263
00:28:22,640 > 00:28:24,820
有多少  不过朗西德
 How many  But that's just what Longshadow

264
00:28:24,820 > 00:28:26,370
和乔治·亨特已经这么做了
and George Hunter have done.

265
00:28:27,060 > 00:28:30,090
他们说我们是歹徒  是黑帮
They call us outlaws, gangbangers.

266
00:28:30,090 > 00:28:31,630
说得好像我们才是问题所在
Treat us like we're the problem.

267
00:28:31,630 > 00:28:34,270
那是因为你把暴力当做解决办法
Because you treat violence like it's the solution.

268
00:28:34,270 > 00:28:36,060
为了防止家园落入普罗科特这种人手中
I will do anything to protect our land

269
00:28:36,060 > 00:28:37,220
我愿意做任何事
from men like Proctor.

270
00:28:37,220 > 00:28:39,210
你所做的只是在伤害自己人而已
All you're doing is hurting more of our own.

271
00:28:39,210 > 00:28:41,200
这比任何一个人都重要
This is bigger than any one person.

272
00:28:42,060 > 00:28:45,400
你去跟死在普罗科特泳池里的那个红骨帮说吧
Tell that to the dead Redbone they pulled out of Proctor's pool.

273
00:28:45,400 > 00:28:47,180
或者躺在重症监护室的那个
Or the other one in the ICU.

274
00:28:47,180 > 00:28:49,370
正义之战总有伤亡
Casualties of a righteous war.

275
00:28:55,370 > 00:28:57,010
我们还是孩子的时候
You know, when we were kids

276
00:28:58,210 > 00:29:00,080
你和汤米搬来和我们住......
and you and Tommy came to live with us...

277
00:29:01,940 > 00:29:03,420
你那么害羞
you were so shy.

278
00:29:05,050 > 00:29:06,390
那么温柔
So gentle.

279
00:29:09,480 > 00:29:11,670
我跟所有人说你是我亲哥哥
I told everybody you were my real brother

280
00:29:12,150 > 00:29:13,830
因为我希望那是真的
because I wanted it to be true.

281
00:29:17,240 > 00:29:19,080
现在我都快认不出你了
Now I barely recognize you.

282
00:29:42,210 > 00:29:44,380
你还挺经打的
You sure can take a hell of a beating.

283
00:29:44,730 > 00:29:45,930
我很佩服
I'll give you that.

284
00:29:50,380 > 00:29:52,010
你为什么不说实话呢?
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

285
00:29:52,480 > 00:29:54,690
他知道你在撒谎  他什么都不知道
 He knows you're lying.  He doesn't know shit.

286
00:29:55,190 > 00:29:57,660
他以为我在撒谎  有什么区别呢?
 He thinks I'm lying.  What's the difference?

287
00:29:57,770 > 00:30:01,200
菲利普斯探员  这可是最基本的心理战术
Come on, Agent Phillips, that's basic psyops protocol.

288
00:30:01,380 > 00:30:03,870
要想扳倒敌人物理上的优势
The only way to overcome a physical advantage

289
00:30:03,870 > 00:30:05,580
就要建立心理上的优势  心理上的优势
 is to establish a psychological one.  A psychological one.

290
00:30:05,580 > 00:30:07,160
没错  记起来了
There you go. You remember.

291
00:30:07,160 > 00:30:08,900
在匡提科上那节课时我睡过了
Yeah, I slept through that class at Quantico.

292
00:30:08,900 > 00:30:10,340
你没有
No, you didn't.

293
00:30:14,370 > 00:30:16,120
你可以玩你喜欢的心理游戏
You know, you can play all the mind games you want,

294
00:30:16,120 > 00:30:18,370
但我们不可能活着离开这里
but we're not leaving here alive.

295
00:30:18,680 > 00:30:19,930
你心里清楚  对吧?
You know that, right?

296
00:30:19,930 > 00:30:21,560
要我说  待在这里
Way I see it, I'm better off in here

297
00:30:21,560 > 00:30:23,230
也比困在你车里好
than I was in the back of your car.

298
00:30:23,240 > 00:30:25,220
如果这是真的  你得扪心自问一下
Well, if that's really true, you have to ask yourself

299
00:30:25,220 > 00:30:27,850
你的三观有多么扭曲
just how fucked up your universe really is.

300
00:30:27,910 > 00:30:29,610
我早就想过了
The thought has crossed my mind.

301
00:30:30,620 > 00:30:32,370
这些年来  我也击碎过不少
You know, I have cracked

302
00:30:32,370 > 00:30:35,110
扭曲的心灵  而你
some pretty twisted minds in my time, but you

303
00:30:35,110 > 00:30:37,110
你还没有放弃  是吗?
You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

304
00:30:39,270 > 00:30:40,410
绝不放弃
Not a chance.

305
00:30:53,030 > 00:30:54,810
说到哪了?
Where were we?

306
00:30:55,250 > 00:30:57,540
你刚刚问我有关杰森·胡德的事
You just asked me about Jason Hood.

307
00:30:57,540 > 00:31:00,300
你让我滚回去自己打飞机
And you told me to go fuck myself.

308
00:31:00,380 > 00:31:01,840
我们都被绑起来了
We're all caught up.

309
00:31:35,350 > 00:31:36,850
我要杀了你
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

310
00:32:07,290 > 00:32:10,990
艾米莉  是我  我打来问个好
Hey, Emily, it's me. Just checking in.

311
00:32:12,940 > 00:32:14,760
总之  回我电话  好吗?
Anyway, call me back, all right?

312
00:32:16,330 > 00:32:18,510
一切还好吧？  好得不能再好了
 Is everything okay?  Couldn't be better.

313
00:32:19,140 > 00:32:20,990
我要下班了
I'm, I'm clocking out.

314
00:32:21,520 > 00:32:22,880
有胡德的消息吗？
Any word from Hood?

315
00:32:23,750 > 00:32:25,430
没有  什么都没有
Nope. Nothing.

316
00:32:27,990 > 00:32:30,390
也许我们该把他的办公室改成游戏室
I'm thinking we should turn his office into a game room.

317
00:32:30,390 > 00:32:31,490
你说呢?
What do you think?

318
00:32:32,940 > 00:32:33,770
我其实有点担心他
I'm actually pretty worried.

319
00:32:33,780 > 00:32:35,520
我试着联系他一整天了
I've been trying to reach him all day.

320
00:32:36,370 > 00:32:37,310
真的吗?
Really?

321
00:32:39,460 > 00:32:40,860
反正你的工作也跑不了
Well, your paperwork's not going anywhere.

322
00:32:40,860 > 00:32:43,290
不如去他家看看情况
Why don't you head over to his place and see what's what?

323
00:32:43,290 > 00:32:44,540
真的吗?  真的
 Yeah?  Yeah.

324
00:32:45,570 > 00:32:46,520
好吧
Okay.

325
00:32:46,580 > 00:32:48,180

00:32:55,280 > 00:32:59,350
只是和老朋友一起喝杯酒而已
No, just having an afternoon drink with an old friend.

331
00:32:59,580 > 00:33:01,910
普莱特恩恩  我在想什么？
Platinumm, what the hell was I thinking?

332
00:33:04,200 > 00:33:05,210
抱歉
Sorry.

333
00:33:06,700 > 00:33:07,970
跟热辣前妻搞上
You know, there is worse things

334
00:33:07,970 > 00:33:09,870
也不是世界末日
than getting some from your hot exwife.

335
00:33:09,870 > 00:33:10,970
我知道
No, I know.

336
00:33:12,300 > 00:33:14,740
她总是反复无常  你不了解艾米莉
There's always a flip side with her. You don't know Emily.

337
00:33:14,740 > 00:33:17,550
我只知道  没人逼你跟她上床
I know there's nobody forcing you to bump uglies with her.

338
00:33:18,120 > 00:33:20,430
这点没错  说得太对了
That is true. That is very true.

339
00:33:20,620 > 00:33:23,680
不过  事情没那么简单
But, you know, it's, it's complicated.

340
00:33:23,690 > 00:33:26,660
为什么男人总会把老二插进
Ugh, how come every time a guy goes sticking his dick

341
00:33:26,670 > 00:33:29,030
不该插的地方  这很复杂吗
someplace he shouldn't, it's complicated?

342
00:33:30,410 > 00:33:31,890
我只是......  别说了
 Well, I just...  No.

343
00:33:31,970 > 00:33:33,310
有时候当我......
You know, sometimes when I...

344
00:33:33,310 > 00:33:36,050
你的前妻很清楚自己在干什么
Your ex knows exactly what she's doing.

345
00:33:36,050 > 00:33:38,550
她把你训的服服帖帖
She's got you exactly where she wants you.

346
00:33:38,870 > 00:33:42,670
上了床就不知道自己是谁了
Losing your fucking mind over some bombass pussy.

347
00:33:42,670 > 00:33:44,750
我明白  我明白  我明白
I know. I know. I know.

348
00:33:44,750 > 00:33:46,290
你是明白怎么做
You already know what to do,

349
00:33:46,320 > 00:33:47,900
但你不会付诸行动
but you're not gonna do it.

350
00:33:50,090 > 00:33:51,760
你是个聪明的女人  普莱特恩
You're a wise woman, Platinumm.

351
00:34:19,870 > 00:34:21,220
住手  白痴！
Hey, shithead!

352
00:34:22,010 > 00:34:24,360
他要被弄死了  你们什么都问不到
You kill him, you'll never get what you want.

353
00:34:26,320 > 00:34:28,260
菲利普斯探员说得对
Agent Phillips is right.

354
00:34:33,430 > 00:34:35,940
要不要告诉我他在哪?
Are you gonna tell me where he is?

355
00:34:48,180 > 00:34:49,980
让他出去透透气
Give him some fresh air!

356
00:35:20,200 > 00:35:21,680
下午好  副警长
Afternoon, Deputy.

357
00:35:22,030 > 00:35:23,370
来点什么吗？
Can I get you something?

358
00:35:23,370 > 00:35:25,830
不了  谢谢  你看见警长了吗？
No, thanks. Have you seen the sheriff?

359
00:35:25,830 > 00:35:27,180
他今天没来轮班
He missed his shift today.

360
00:35:27,180 > 00:35:28,680
没有  没看见
No. No, I haven't.

361
00:35:28,830 > 00:35:31,360
不过他总会出现的  一向如此
But he'll turn up. He always does.

362
00:35:34,020 > 00:35:35,500
你很了解他吧？
You know him pretty well, huh?

363
00:35:37,120 > 00:35:39,150
我对你也是这样
I could say the same about you.

364
00:35:40,330 > 00:35:41,840
是吗？  是的
 Could you?  Mm.

365
00:35:41,890 > 00:35:43,080
恐怕不是吧
I'm not so sure.

366
00:35:45,500 > 00:35:48,160
有一些人  在你了解他之前
Some people, you can know them

367
00:35:48,160 > 00:35:50,480
就清楚他的为人
before you know about them.

368
00:35:52,400 > 00:35:53,360
或许吧
Maybe.

369
00:35:53,840 > 00:35:56,630
如果喝着啤酒听这些  可能觉得更深奥
Or maybe that'd sound a lot more profound if I had had a few beers.

370
00:35:57,010 > 00:35:58,620
是  我也觉得
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

371
00:36:00,860 > 00:36:03,310
好了  有消息告诉我......
All right, well, if you hear from him...

372
00:36:03,580 > 00:36:04,550
一定
Will do.

373
00:36:11,390 > 00:36:13,950
现在不说就没机会了  神秘人先生
Now or never, mystery man.

374
00:36:13,960 > 00:36:16,200
杰森·胡德在哪?  他死了
 Where is Jason Hood?  He's dead!

375
00:36:16,270 > 00:36:18,070
他妈的他死了  我说过了
He's fucking dead. I told you.

376
00:36:18,070 > 00:36:19,720
我为什么要信你?
And why should I believe you?

377
00:36:19,720 > 00:36:22,180
因为是我杀的  满意吗?
Cause I killed him, all right?

378
00:36:24,190 > 00:36:25,850
给你30秒
30 seconds.

379
00:36:26,140 > 00:36:28,580
要是哪一个字我不信  你就等着被碾死
I doubt a word, you become roadkill.

380
00:36:30,030 > 00:36:32,210
他给我5万
The kid offered me 50 grand

381
00:36:32,240 > 00:36:34,870
让我杀了你派来的拉风男?
to take out your man in the fancy suit, all right?

382
00:36:34,870 > 00:36:38,120
先付了2万5  事成之后再付剩下的
25 up front, 25 when it was done.

383
00:36:38,490 > 00:36:39,900
你杀了昆汀？
You killed Quentin?

384
00:36:41,550 > 00:36:43,070
是费了点力气......
Well, it took some doing...

385
00:36:45,020 > 00:36:46,050
确实是我杀的
but, yeah.

386
00:36:47,030 > 00:36:48,320
继续说
Go on.

387
00:36:48,320 > 00:36:50,830
在我杀了昆汀之后
So after I killed Quentin,

388
00:36:51,430 > 00:36:53,980
杰森  他不想付剩下的钱
Jason, he didn't want to pay up

389
00:36:54,200 > 00:36:56,230
所以威胁要揭发我
and he threatened to expose me.

390
00:36:56,920 > 00:36:59,370
那你为了拿钱把他杀了?
So you killed him and took the money?

391
00:36:59,380 > 00:37:00,650
做事拿钱
Fair is fair.

392
00:37:05,400 > 00:37:07,700
我的钱现在在哪?
Where is my money now?

393
00:37:07,770 > 00:37:09,270
在女妖镇
It's back in Banshee.

394
00:37:09,270 > 00:37:11,050
所有的?  是的
 All of it?  Yes.

396
00:37:15,410 > 00:37:18,390
总共加起来到底有多少钱?
And exactly how much is all of it?

397
00:37:20,360 > 00:37:24,740
布兰特利  他喜欢低调的处理这种事情
Brantley, he likes to deal with this sort of thing up close and personal.

398
00:37:25,460 > 00:37:27,220
6万2千
62,000.

399
00:37:28,980 > 00:37:30,780
我会送你回家的
I will take you back home.

400
00:37:30,780 > 00:37:33,120
你带我去看杰森·胡德的尸体
You will show me Jason Hood's body.

401
00:37:33,120 > 00:37:35,330
把我的钱还给我
You will return my money.

402
00:37:35,330 > 00:37:37,230
你刚才为什么没一枪崩了我?
What's going to stop you from shooting me the moment I do?

404
00:37:40,400 > 00:37:42,030
因为你不在名单上
You're not on the list.

405
00:37:50,510 > 00:37:53,550
看样子在我拿回钱之后
Seems I will be taking a trip south of the border

406
00:37:53,550 > 00:37:55,750
要去南边境转转了
after I retrieve my money.

407
00:37:56,220 > 00:37:57,750
很遗憾  菲利普斯探员
Sadly, Agent Phillips,

408
00:37:57,750 > 00:38:00,720
我们不能一同前往了
your home is not on the itinerary.

409
00:38:01,330 > 00:38:04,860
万达  告诉科尔先生到前面靠边停
Wanda, tell Mr. Cole up front to pull over.

410

我的朋友们会陪同你

411
00:38:07,520 > 00:38:09,450
去你下一个目的地

很安全的  菲利普斯探员
Safe travels, Agent Phillips.

414
00:38:16,230 > 00:38:17,250
走吧
Let's go.

415
00:38:52,420 > 00:38:57,140
万达  让科尔带我们回女妖镇
Wanda, tell Mr. Cole to take us back to Banshee.

416
00:38:57,140 > 00:38:59,130

The boys will catch up later.

417
00:38:59,130 > 00:39:00,620
然后给我调杯喝的
And mix me a drink.

418
00:39:00,620 > 00:39:03,900
经典布雷顿  多加糖

419
00:39:03,900 > 00:39:05,410
马上就来  布兰特利先生  
Right away, Mr. Brantley.

422
00:39:18,290 > 00:39:20,200
你要回去蹲监狱了
You're going back into a cell.

423
00:39:20,200 > 00:39:21,700
你会被判八到十年牢
You're facing eight to ten years.

424
00:39:21,700 > 00:39:25,060
你这一生完了
Life as you know it is over.

425
00:39:42,820 > 00:39:43,910
站住
Hey!

426
00:39:53,690 > 00:39:55,260
别挡道
Get out of the way!

427
00:40:01,100 > 00:40:02,120
趴下
Stay down.

428
00:40:09,980 > 00:40:11,270
回来  趴下
 Get back!  Down.

429
00:40:12,010 > 00:40:13,990
去看看后面的房间  确保没人出去
Check the back rooms. Make sure everyone's out.

430
00:40:13,990 > 00:40:15,280
雷文  我是布罗克
Raven, hey, it's Brock.

431
00:40:15,280 > 00:40:18,130
听着  萨沃伊脱衣舞俱乐部正在发生人质劫持
Look, I've got a 211 in progress at the Savoy.

432
00:40:18,130 > 00:40:19,300
看起来有五名袭击者
Looks like five assailants

433
00:40:19,310 > 00:40:23,020
和大概二十四名平民被困在里面  快来

434
00:40:53,460 > 00:40:54,410
起来
Get up.

435
00:40:59,740 > 00:41:00,730
妈的
Fuck.

436
00:41:10,830 > 00:41:13,060
真正的猎犬  昆汀  
True gundog, Quentin.

437
00:41:14,180 > 00:41:16,610
总能成功让敌人现型
He could flush out the best of them.

438
00:41:17,640 > 00:41:19,790
跟我讲讲  你是怎么打败他的
Tell me, how'd you beat him?

439
00:41:20,880 > 00:41:23,340
不  我什么都不会说
No, I'm not telling you anything.

440
00:41:23,500 > 00:41:26,480
除非你先告诉我你们为什么为了杰森·胡德这样的混蛋大老远来
Not until you tell me why you came so far for an asshole like Jason Hood.

442
00:41:28,780 > 00:41:31,130
像你这样的人肯定不会为了6万块
I mean, a guy like you doesn't come all the way

443
00:41:31,130 > 00:41:33,640
横跨整个国家而来
across the country for 60 grand.

444
00:41:33,640 > 00:41:37,400
我这种人为了5毛钱都会来的
A guy like me would come across the country for 50 cents.

445
00:42:12,060 > 00:42:13,400
开始挖吧
Start digging.

446
00:42:17,250 > 00:42:19,520
我的身体已经坏了
My body has failed me.

447
00:42:19,650 > 00:42:21,490
也许是我自找的
I failed it. Either way.

448
00:42:21,490 > 00:42:24,530
结果  简单的事情我都做不来
Things that you take for granted, I can't do.

449
00:42:24,620 > 00:42:26,490
去杂货店买东西
Simple trip to buy groceries

450
00:42:26,490 > 00:42:28,980
或者去饭店吃饭
or have a meal at a restaurant.

451
00:42:28,980 > 00:42:31,850
我连啪啪都不可以了
I can't even fuck anymore.

452
00:42:32,040 > 00:42:36,860
但我有自己的分类账本
But one thing I do have is my ledger.

453
00:42:36,990 > 00:42:39,310
我自己记账
I keep my own books

454
00:42:39,310 > 00:42:41,740
来保持收支平衡
and I keep everything balanced.

455
00:42:41,740 > 00:42:44,730
一个小数点都不会差
Not a decimal point out of place.

456
00:42:45,560 > 00:42:48,650
罪恶都在账本的细节里
The devil is in the details.

457
00:42:49,930 > 00:42:51,740
而这些细节
And the details

458
00:42:51,930 > 00:42:55,710
是像我这样的人唯一所有的
are all that a guy like me has.

459
00:42:56,080 > 00:42:57,940
如果是这样的话  我猜你很想知道
In that case, I bet you'd love to know

460
00:42:57,940 > 00:43:00,490
杰森·胡德最后说了什么
what Jason Hood's last words were.

461
00:43:10,530 > 00:43:12,440
告诉我他说了什么
Tell me what he said.

462
00:43:19,080 > 00:43:20,680
他说要告诉你......
He said to tell you...

463
00:43:21,810 > 00:43:24,770
他很快就会见到你的
he'll see your fat ass real fucking soon.

464
00:43:38,120 > 00:43:40,360
上来  你  给我出来  出来
Up here now. You, outta here! Get outta here!

465
00:43:40,360 > 00:43:41,340
快走!

00:43:41,360 > 00:43:42,440
现在趴下!
Down now!

467
00:44:20,300 > 00:44:21,410
待在这里
Stay here.

468
00:44:25,020 > 00:44:26,690
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

469
00:44:26,700 > 00:44:27,700
不要！
No!

470
00:45:05,340 > 00:45:06,410
你自己喝吧
You have it.

471
00:45:18,760 > 00:45:19,910
科尔先生
Mr. Cole.

472
00:45:20,570 > 00:45:23,870
万达  猎枪放在哪里了?  柜橱里  底层右面
 Wanda, where are the shotgun shells?  Cabinet, bottom right.

473
00:45:27,800 > 00:45:29,860
看别处  不要看我  不
 Look away. Don't look at me.  No.

474
00:45:30,270 > 00:45:32,390
所有人听着  听着
Everyone listen up. Listen up.

475
00:45:34,230 > 00:45:35,750
我们不是来杀你们的
We're not here to kill you.

476
00:45:36,230 > 00:45:37,630
但我们完事以后......
But when I'm done here... 

477
00:45:38,980 > 00:45:41,070
你们都要重新换份工作了
you're all gonna have to find new jobs.

478
00:45:41,610 > 00:45:43,220
扔掉你们的武器!  把手举起来!
Drop your weapons! Hands in the air!

479
00:45:43,220 > 00:45:45,430
不要! 你他妈别想了
Don't! Don't you fucking do it.

480
00:45:46,790 > 00:45:47,910
都不许动
Nobody move.

481
00:45:49,600 > 00:45:51,320
我说了把你们的武器扔掉  伙计们

小子  那把刀要是再靠近她的脖子
Son, that knife gets any closer to her neck,

483

除了你以外  条子

妈的  汤米  你要听我的话
Damn it, Tommy! You need to listen to me.

492
00:48:42,520 > 00:48:44,180
不!
No!

493
00:48:58,460 > 00:49:00,550
阿尔玛  萨沃伊这里需要经济医疗救护
Alma, we need EMTs at the Savoy now.

494
00:49:01,480 > 00:49:03,050
我去查看后面的房间
I'll clear the back rooms.

495
00:49:03,590 > 00:49:05,200

497
00:49:08,170 > 00:49:10,690
雷文  你那边没事吧?  没事
 Raven, you okay over there?  Yeah.

498
00:49:13,910 > 00:49:15,020
刀!
Knife! 

499
00:49:55,730 > 00:49:57,530
胡德死哪去了
Where the fuck is Hood?

502
00:50:37,910 > 00:50:39,310
够深了
That's deep enough.

503
00:50:46,330 > 00:50:47,620
转身
Turn around.

504
00:50:55,290 > 00:50:56,720
你不想这样的
You don't want to do this.

505
00:51:02,700 > 00:51:05,350
杀联邦探员会给你找大麻烦的
Killing a federal agent will get you the needle.

506
00:51:07,270 > 00:51:08,270
再见

因为好奇
I was curious.

511

我被派寻找失踪探员
I was tasked to find a missing agent.

512
00:52:01,440 > 00:52:03,000
你跟这事无关
You're not part of that story.

513
00:52:03,830 > 00:52:05,860
调查局对你一无所知
The Bureau doesn't know anything about you.

514
00:52:07,690 > 00:52:10,310
那我干嘛不把你埋这儿呢?
So what's stopping me from leaving you in this hole?

515
00:52:18,370 > 00:52:20,640
自救这门功课你学的太垃圾了
You're doing a pretty shitty job of saving yourself.

看来我们俩都得用功了

没事了
We're good.

但你应该知道...
But you should know...

522
00:53:18,850 > 00:53:20,800
在我以为你会是那个
I had to do something to cover my ass

523
00:53:20,800 > 00:53:22,640
你不是的人时  我不得不做了些
when I thought you would turn out to be

524
00:53:24,480 > 00:53:25,570
自保的事
who you weren't.

529
00:54:23,940 > 00:54:25,970
我们都不知道你叫什么
We don't even know what to call you.

530
00:54:40,830 > 00:54:41,880
怎么了
What is it?

531
00:54:45,320 > 00:54:46,260
什么
What?

532
00:54:49,530 > 00:54:50,920
他们的[荷兰语]
Godverdomme!

533
00:54:50,920 > 00:54:51,920
{\an8}女妖镇边界

534
00:54:55,590 > 00:54:58,250
你的生活  那个生活
Your life, that life,

535
00:54:58,450 > 00:55:00,190
结束了
is over.

536
00:55:29,460 > 00:55:30,810
我自己干的  你不是
 I work alone.  No, you don't.

537
00:55:30,860 > 00:55:33,220
楼里有人和你一起
You had someone in that building with you.

538
00:55:33,230 > 00:55:36,440
你们两个在从楼顶下落时
And you two weren't performing some remote hack

539
00:55:36,440 > 00:55:39,500
黑掉了市场上一些最先进的保安系统
on some of the most advanced security systems on the market

540
00:55:39,500 > 00:55:41,120
让我查查
while rappelling from the roof,

541
00:55:41,130 > 00:55:44,260
这就有三个人了
so by my count, that adds up to three guys

542
00:55:44,260 > 00:55:46,110
还不算兔子先生
not counting Mr. Rabbit.

543
00:55:46,110 > 00:55:49,030
什么  你以为我在为什么犯罪首脑工作
What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind

544
00:55:49,030 > 00:55:50,800
他还自称什么兔子先生吗
that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?

545
00:55:50,800 > 00:55:53,210
没错  我就是这么认为的
Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

546
00:55:53,210 > 00:55:54,530
交出兔子
Give me Rabbit.

547
00:55:54,530 > 00:55:56,840
把他供出来  我跟你谈个交易
Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal.

548
00:55:56,850 > 00:56:00,300
也许你会被判18个月  但一年就可以出狱
Maybe you get 18 months. You'll be out after a year.

549
00:56:00,300 > 00:56:02,120
我会给你提供证人保护计划
I would offer you witness protection,

550
00:56:02,120 > 00:56:03,940
但你不会有身份
but you don't have an identity,

551
00:56:03,940 > 00:56:07,230
所以我猜你大概不需要新身份
so my guess is that you won't need a new one.

552
00:56:08,070 > 00:56:09,520
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

553
00:56:17,540 > 00:56:19,100
在我看来
The way I see it,

554
00:56:19,160 > 00:56:22,460
你知道谈话的另一个方向是进监狱
you know you got jail on the other side of this conversation.

555
00:56:22,460 > 00:56:24,230
我用你的指纹提取了档案
I used your prints to pull your file.

556
00:56:24,230 > 00:56:26,390
压根没有  我们甚至不知道你叫什么
There isn't one. We don't even know what to call you.

557
00:56:26,390 > 00:56:30,190
你是个幽灵  你所知道生活已经结束了
You're a ghost. Life as you know it is over.

558
00:56:30,190 > 00:56:33,890
之后的很多年  你都回不了家
You aren't going home for many years.

559
00:56:33,890 > 00:56:37,380
你会被关回监狱  而明天的这个时候
You're going back into a cell and tomorrow at this time,

560
00:56:37,380 > 00:56:40,380
你会在莱克斯等审判
you'll be in Rikers awaiting trial.

561
00:56:40,380 > 00:56:43,710
快点吧  这案子不断牵扯到兔子
Come on, this case has Rabbit written all over it.

562
00:56:43,710 > 00:56:45,950
什么  你以为我在为什么犯罪首脑工作
What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind

563
00:56:45,960 > 00:56:47,750
他还自称什么兔子先生吗
that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?

564
00:56:47,750 > 00:56:49,110
交出兔子
Give me Rabbit.

565
00:56:49,110 > 00:56:51,490
把他供出来  我跟你谈个交易
Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal.

566
00:56:53,310 > 00:56:54,390
好
Okay.

567
00:56:54,660 > 00:56:57,090
为了记录在案  说出你的名字
This is for the record. State your name.

568
00:56:57,090 > 00:56:58,180
约翰·史密斯
John Smith.

569
00:56:58,660 > 00:57:01,100
你在干嘛  耍我吗
What are you doing? Are you fucking with me?

570
00:57:01,100 > 00:57:02,500
没有  是你在耍我
No, you're fucking with me.

571
00:57:02,500 > 00:57:04,240
交易是真的
The deal is real. 

572
00:57:04,240 > 00:57:07,980
你说你想接受交易  你这个傻逼
You said you wanted to take the deal, you stupid motherfucker.

573
00:57:07,980 > 00:57:09,410
也许  但我不会坐在这
Maybe, but I'm not gonna sit here

574
00:57:09,410 > 00:57:11,220
替你干活
and do your fuckin' job for you.

575
00:57:12,000 > 00:57:14,040
这是你的葬礼  混球
It's your funeral, asshole.
