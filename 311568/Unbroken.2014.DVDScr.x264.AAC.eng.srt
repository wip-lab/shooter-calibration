00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,899
A true story

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,119
we are here.

3
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:27,206
2438 meters attach.This is it, guys.

4
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,328
 you got it, sam?
 roger.

5
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,572
If you get this I pay for the drinks.

6
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,301
I get no bar inside with you,handsome.

7
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,128
You confuse the ladies.

8
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:55,647
get the cameras, boys.I lit it like a Christmas.

9
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,556
Bomber, you're in command.

10
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,834
Bomber to pilot.
rojer.

11
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,517
Bomber to crew.

12
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,444
Bomluiken opened.

13
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,623
Damn antiaircraft guns!

14
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:45,851
Come on.

15
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,899
Come on, Zamp.

16
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,029
There you are.

17
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,534
Bombs dropped.

18
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,370
Pilot, you can command.
To Receive.

19
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,043
Here we go.

20
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,975
Yes, just like Christmas.

21
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,567
Bomluiken stuck.

22
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,154
Zero, arriving aircraft for us.

23
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,449
Here they come.

24
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,003
Keep the doors closed, Zamp.
 To Receive.

25
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,506
Get them, Mitchell.

26
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,801
About nine.

27
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,322
Incoming three.

28
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,286
Turn them off, Mitchell.

29
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,274
Among us.

30
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,279
They're behind us.

32
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,047
Brooks, he is among us.You must go there.

33
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,890
Glassman?

34
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,126
Let me look at you.

35
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,290
I know.You must be brave.

36
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:27,012
You're still a handsome guy.I'm sick of you.

37
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,607
I know.

38
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,652
I'm here. Hang on.I want to go home.

39
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,373
You are going, Harry.Think of home.

40
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:13,748
Take this here.

41
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,780
Well done, guys.

42
00:07:55,927 --> 00:08:00,698
The back is shot to pieces.
 The hydraulic system is broken, but we fly.

43
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:03,942
We have no valves and therefore no braking.

44
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,947
How far is it to the base?
Five hours if we get that far.

45
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,327
The runway is almost 1829 meters long.We have 3048 meter is required without braking.

46
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:27,549
God made two great lights.

47
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:32,354
The greater light to the day control, and the lesser light to govern the night.

49
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,352
Light and darkness

50
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,190
day and night are separated.

51
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,528
God put everyone in place.

52
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,197
He wanted no war between the two.

53
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,492
He said:"I have created them both."

54
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:59,081
You have to live through the night

55
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,334
do not fight it.

56
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,589
For God said:"The night is also mine."

57
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,301
He sent his son Jesus,not to drive a wedge.

58
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,306
Not to make war against the sins of man.

59
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,978
But to forgive them.Forgive their sins.

60
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,438
Smile for the sinner.

61
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,525
Accept darkness.

62
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,778
Live through the night.

63
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:34,116
Love your enemy.

64
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,795
I smell garlic now?
What are you doing here?

65
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:33,091
Return to Italy spaghetti and take your family with you.

66
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,094
Lift it up.

67
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,264
Stay away from him.

68
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,527
Stay down Italian sucker.

69
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,159
Get him out.

70
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
To Run.

71
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:13,257
The only reason you're not stuck,because we take into account your parents.

72
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,634
Everyone wants to have you gone.

73
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,894
Sorry, Louise.He fought again.

74
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:35,445
We found this. He has painted,but it's just drink.

75
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,621
Why So?

76
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,167
Why are you doing this?

77
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,671
I do not know.

78
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,841
How could you?

79
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,811
What do you do to this family?

80
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:03,015
They want us all here,and then you do this?

81
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:08,937
Want to go to jail?Why do you continue?

82
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,938
Go to your room.

83
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:08,455
Care for my family.

84
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,751
And beware my little Louie.

85
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,497
Come on, Jimmy.

86
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,500
Come on, Pete.

87
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,463
Is anyone down there?Who's there?

88
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,369
This is really stupid.Since when are you so smart?

89
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:24,489
Faster.Why So? No one follows me.

90
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,242
I follow you now.

91
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,751
I can not.I'm not like you.

92
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:39,254
I'm a zero.Let me now but a zero.

93
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:43,717
What are you talking about?
 I'm not at the track team.

94
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,471
Yes, it can.If you can handle it, you get it.

95
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,850
What?
 If you can handle it, you get it.

96
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,521
If you train harder and fight than the others ...

97
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,182
then you win.Then you walk past them.

98
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:03,820
Whether you go on as before so you end up as a failure.

99
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:08,450
You can do it, Lou.You just have to believe in.

100
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,746
I believe in nothing.

101
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,875
I do.

102
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,129
Come on.

103
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:53,598
Come on, Italian sucker.

104
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:15,263
Come on, Louie.

105
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:21,394
What can run that boy.

106
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:24,731
They call him:"Torrance Tornado."

107
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,502
It seems as if his feet do not touch the ground.

108
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,897
Come on. Keep going.

109
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,456
Come on, Louie.

110
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:31,772
Come on.

111
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:39,722
Fr from Torrance Tornado ran the mile in four minutes, and 21.3 seconds.

112
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:44,477
Zamperini is officially the fastest runner in American history.

113
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:47,647
This boy is on the way to the Olympics.

114
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:52,610
Why should I come. Yet you do not win.
I know that.

115
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:58,741
The next Olympics I leave see it. This is just to practice.

116
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:02,162
Tokyo?

117
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,796
You're smart.Take care of yourself.

118
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:13,924
Also make some fun.

119
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,036
Greeting the beautiful German girls for me.
 You know that.

120
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:25,435
Come here.

121
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:28,521
Thanks, Pete.

122
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:31,149
For everything.

123
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:40,158
Go.

124
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,004
A moment of pain is worth lifelong glory.

125
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,090
Remember that.

126
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,448
Landing gear down.
 Here we go.

127
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:31,918
We are approaching too fast.110 km / h.

128
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:35,756
Almost.

129
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,259
Still too fast.
Come on.

130
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,859
Flat Tyre.

131
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:51,539
Thank you, God.

132
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:33,665
You are going to pray now?

133
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:37,001
I've been busy.

134
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:46,052
My mother sometimes prays.
There are many people who do it.

135
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:54,227
He says something back?

136
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:56,980
What?

137
00:22:57,147 --> 00:23:00,525
He says I can not throw bombs.

138
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:08,199
Really?

139
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:12,787
Well, buddy.

140
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:17,125
Right Now.

141
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,224
Come on, Louie.

142
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:43,276
Come on, buddy.

143
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,321
Keep pushing.

144
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:54,871
Stop.
 And how much?

145
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,629
4:12. 
You come close.

146
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:05,558
Hopefully you're not as fast in a sack.

147
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:21,606
We have a mission.A rescue operation.

148
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:26,486
A B24 Canton has not been reached.They probably are at sea.

149
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:33,409
The ocean is huge.
 Yes, and we have new crew members.

150
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:36,704
We have a new plane?

151
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:52,871
It's like sitting in the living room and the house trying to fly.

152
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:56,908
They took the parts for other aircraft.Fortunately, we have the engine yet.

153
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:59,629
According to Lieutenant was allowed to it in the air.

154
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:04,566
It was approved.
 By Helen Keller.

155
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:17,829
The ocean is huge.

156
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:21,040
Yes, enormous.

157
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,422
Mitchell, your turn.

158
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:41,102
So a duck walks into a bar.

159
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,356
Or rather staggering.

160
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:50,820
He comes in and says to the bartender:"Give me a Creme de menthe."

161
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:59,638
Moment.First engine is off.

162
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:02,616
The others use more fuel.

163
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:06,669
I do not know.

164
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:09,964
engineer,You can take a look at the engine?

165
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,635
What is happening?
 Call to the base.

166
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:17,555
Which One?
 Left engine. Give more gas.

167
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,558
Right engine more gas needed.
 They have enough.

168
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,940
Both lefthand motors are turned off.

169
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:31,402
Everything to the right, Phil

170
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:42,372
Shall we?
 Get ready for the crash.

171
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:47,252
Gunner, grab the survival box.

172
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,420
Try the guns.

173
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:54,259
Who has the life raft?
 Glassman.

174
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:58,763
Who controls the raft?
 I.

175
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,977
Distress Signal.Green Hornet here. We crash.

176
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:11,359
Everyone get ready.

177
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:21,763
In a unique performance the black American Jesse Owens

178
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,183
four gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters

179
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,186
long jump and the 400 meter relay.

180
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:33,650
So immediately starts the 5000 meter race, under the direction of Don Lash

181
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:37,412
and debutant Louie Zamperini.

182
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:13,356
The runners are divided in three groups

183
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:17,485
Don Lash and the Finns:Salmin and Hackert in the lead.

184
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:22,323
Finns are always a favorite long distance.

185
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:28,621
In the second group we the American Louie Zamperini.

186
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:39,924
Finns: Hackert, Lehtin and Salmin still set the pace.

187
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:44,053
Zamperini also falling behind.

188
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:07,118
We go on to the eighth round.The Finns lead with Salmin in the first place.

189
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:10,163
Come on, Louie.

190
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:14,334
Come on, Louie.

191
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:25,454
We start with the last round.The Finns lead.

192
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:29,876
Don Lash apparently does not the medal home to the US

193
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,607
Something happens behind.

194
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:42,612
Yes, Zamperini takes Norwegian Rolf Hansen.

195
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:51,496
He apparently has a reserve tank.He really takes some time.

196
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,921
Hackert and Lehtinen are one and two,but look at that Zamperini.

197
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:02,215
He Don Lash in sight.

198
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:10,181
Don Lash is not the first American,but high school boy Zamperini

200
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:17,689
Something I've never seen.

201
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:26,656
The record for the final round was 69.2 seconds.

202
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:29,826
Zamperini did there 56 seconds.

203
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:34,289
That record remains still for a moment.

204
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,761
Go ahead.

205
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:59,476
I count to three.

206
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:42,727
Go ahead.

207
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:58,034
Glassman did not make it.

208
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:04,791
Cup did not make it.
 Put it out of your mind, Mac.

209
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:13,591
We die.
 No, we do not do that, Mac.

210
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,722
They do not know where we are.
 They find us.

211
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:22,809
They can not see us.

212
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:26,688
Tell him to keep his mouth.

213
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:29,065
Shut up.
 We're dying here.

214
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:31,317
Now Shut up, Mac.

215
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,245
Mac chocolate.

216
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,999
A piece of the evening and morning.

217
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:54,544
Not?

218
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,552
Two or three sips a day, right?

219
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:05,972
Then it takes a while.

220
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:27,744
I'm glad it's you.

221
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:31,248
I am glad I am.

222
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,197
What was that?

223
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:48,158
Mac, search the flares.

224
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:03,924
Below.

225
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,593
Turn around.

226
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:14,142
Dick, invert.

227
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:54,474
What did you do, Mac?

228
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:00,897
It does not matter.
 Does it not matter?

229
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:10,699
It does not matter.

230
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:29,217
DAY 3

231
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,584
Grab him, Mac.

232
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:02,769
I do not think I can.

233
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:08,150
We have to try.

234
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,913
We had to try it.

235
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:29,254
You know what?Maybe the fish are not so picky.

237
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:51,776
Good work, Phil.

238
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,990
Right Here.

239
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:10,128
Come here, Mac.

240
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,132
Come on.

241
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,653
Is it good?

242
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,578
The Japanese eat raw fish.

243
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:47,833
If you ask me,you do not eat before you cook it.

244
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,545
A little lemon and a little garlic.

245
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:57,092
When we get home,my mother will cook for you.

246
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:01,972
You know that article still in Life Magazine about Eddie Rickenbacker?

247
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,144
He and his crew were without fuel over the Pacific Ocean.

248
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,398
They drove around in 24 days rafts.

249
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,066
24 days.

250
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:16,611
But she survived, right?

251
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:20,574
They were crazy.

252
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,577
But they made it.

253
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,333
We need to keep talking not to lose our minds.

254
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,130
You know that I'm looking forward? Mama's gnocchi.

255
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:37,132
Italians.

256
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:41,428
Nobody makes gnocchi like them.

257
00:43:45,307 --> 00:43:48,852
They are so airy as clouds.

258
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:55,400
First she makes the dough out of flour.

259
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,945
Just as fine as talcum powder.

260
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:06,286
Then they used at least a dozen eggs.

261
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,959
Then she gives them their thunder, Mac.

262
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:18,673
On their thunder.

263
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,760
Then pour over them there.

264
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:59,256
DAY 18

265
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,969
show me the way

266
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:08,598
The night is dark

267
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:13,645
and I am far from home

268
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:19,276
show me the way

269
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:38,170
Do you think God created the stars, Phil?

270
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:44,009
Yup.

271
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:48,597
Do you think there some big plans ...

272
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:52,434
we survived and others do not?

273
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:57,856
Why are we here?

274
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:00,609
The plan is

275
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:05,322
you have to live,as well as you can.

276
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:11,495
You should try to have fun,on the way.

277
00:46:13,747 --> 00:46:16,917
And then one day it's over.

278
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,960
So you wake up

279
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:24,466
and sees an angel sit beside the bed.

280
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:29,012
The angel says:

281
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:36,102
"Now you may ask me all these stupid questions.

282
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:42,776
I have all the answers. "

283
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,862
Do you believe that?

284
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:51,368
Yes, I believe that.

285
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:20,438
Our Father who is in heaven.Your name will be sanctified.

286
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:28,029
If you help me through this, my prayers answered ...

287
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:32,200
I swear I dedicating my life to You.

288
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:38,832
I'll do whatever you want.

289
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:45,630
Please.

290
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:22,394
Go ahead.

291
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,723
You got it?

292
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:01,892
DAY 27

293
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:04,102
It's just a scratch.

294
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:15,906
How are things?
 It stinks.

295
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:20,535
That is the connection, not you.

296
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:28,794
We defeated Rickenbackers record four days ago.

297
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:35,824
Do you like to know?

298
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:59,634
My God.

299
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,946
Go out, guys.

300
00:53:52,164 --> 00:53:55,250
I'm still here.

301
00:53:57,169 --> 00:54:00,672
If the Japanese are so bad we will win the war.

302
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:32,968
Right Here.

303
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:38,826
He arranged for a surprise.

304
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:47,167
He came down like a bomber.

305
00:55:49,086 --> 00:55:52,214
Sharks gobbling distraught.

306
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:56,552
He saved your skinny ass.

307
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:11,317
1937. Best baseball player.

308
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:19,742
A boy from Detroit.

309
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:22,536
Gehringer.

310
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,001
Mac, join the game.

311
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:44,141
I'm still here.

312
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:46,810
I'm still here.

313
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:52,191
What do you make for breakfast, Zamp?

314
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:57,363
You tell me.

315
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:03,869
Gnocchi from your mother.

316
00:57:04,036 --> 00:57:06,789
Gnocchi for breakfast?

317
00:57:08,874 --> 00:57:11,126
Why not?

318
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,221
I'm dying.

319
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:35,651
Perhaps, Mac.

320
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:42,324
Tonight, you think?

321
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:51,250
May Be.

322
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,844
Tonight, I think.

323
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,523
If you made the dough,roll out.

324
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:20,321
Roll it out ...

325
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:23,741
until it is smooth and smooth ...

326
00:59:11,413 --> 00:59:15,751
DAY 45

327
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,599
I have good news.

328
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:14,602
And bad news.

329
01:00:43,964 --> 01:00:46,717
You alright?

330
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,388
The country feels weird.

331
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:56,268
Weird.

332
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,055
Shut up.

333
01:01:34,306 --> 01:01:36,225
Stop.

334
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:39,520
Please stop.

335
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:51,592
How many troops are in Hawaii?

336
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:55,679
The colonel wants to know how many troops are in Hawaii.

337
01:02:56,805 --> 01:03:00,726
I do not know.
 Pick up.

338
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,105
I do not know.

339
01:03:06,273 --> 01:03:09,234
I have not been there.

340
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:17,326
Is he in this picture?

341
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,515
Is this you?

342
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:26,118
Are you an Olympic athlete?

343
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:30,297
Are you a famous Olympic athlete?

344
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:34,134
Where the radar is in a B24E?

345
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,680
The colonel wants to know where radar is in a B24E.

346
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,890
We used the oldD models.

347
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:43,269
Are you a bombardier?

348
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:49,275
What happened to Marines Makin Island?

349
01:03:51,652 --> 01:03:53,904
Where is the northern bombs land?

350
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:55,823
Where is the northern bombs land?

351
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,410
Press two buttons. What happened to the Marines?

352
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,709
Sign the northern bombs site.

353
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,476
They were beheaded.

354
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:01,972
I drew a Philco radio with buttons on the side.

355
01:06:30,603 --> 01:06:32,396
Take off your clothes.

356
01:07:16,982 --> 01:07:19,068
On your knees.

357
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,530
On your knees?

358
01:07:23,697 --> 01:07:26,075
On your knees.

359
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:59,478
Are not we in Tokyo?
 Of Course.

360
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,108
Here I would run a race during the Olympics.

361
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:07,861
Before they were canceled.

362
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:11,949
I've always been wanting to go to Tokyo.

363
01:10:12,866 --> 01:10:16,161
Be careful what you wish for,buddy.

364
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:11,050
Soldier.

365
01:11:11,216 --> 01:11:13,035
Officer.

366
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:18,592
Soldier.Officer.

367
01:12:04,524 --> 01:12:08,111
Good evening, old prisoners.

368
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:12,657
Welcome new men.

369
01:12:13,783 --> 01:12:18,989
This is the detention center Omori.

370
01:12:20,706 --> 01:12:24,877
I'm Corporal Watanabe.

371
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:33,970
You are enemies of Japan.

372
01:12:36,305 --> 01:12:40,518
You will accordingly be treated.

373
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:20,808
Look at me.

374
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:26,147
Look me in the eyes.

375
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:05,603
Look at me.

376
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:22,620
Do not look at me.

377
01:14:23,704 --> 01:14:26,541
Do not look at me.

378
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:40,513
New prisoners, you should not go.

379
01:14:41,848 --> 01:14:44,725
You are quarantined.

380
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:48,855
We can not use disorders in the camp.

381
01:15:29,562 --> 01:15:33,316
Good evening, boys.Tom Miller, barrack commander.

382
01:15:33,483 --> 01:15:35,485
I point you to the bunk beds.

383
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:43,201
Do the top bunk.

384
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:46,537
305.

385
01:15:48,414 --> 01:15:51,250
You sleep here next to Sleeping Beauty.

386
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,628
Sit down.

387
01:15:53,795 --> 01:15:56,339
307 you here.

388
01:15:58,132 --> 01:16:00,885
You are?
 Frank Tinker.

389
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:03,763
Tinker, you take the top bunk.

390
01:16:07,016 --> 01:16:09,811
You've met the bird.

391
01:16:14,273 --> 01:16:17,193
Why do you call him the bird?
 Because he listens.

392
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,572
When he heard we called him, he would kill us.

393
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:27,328
He comes from a rich family and wanted to be an officer.

394
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:31,499
That was not approved,the matter went not so well.

395
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:35,420
That explains his unpredictable behavior not.

396
01:16:38,631 --> 01:16:43,636
Commander Fitzgerald.
 Zamperini.

397
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:51,310
They want answers.

398
01:16:51,477 --> 01:16:56,065
That they do not get?
 Not one.

399
01:16:58,276 --> 01:17:02,321
Try to get some sleep.

404
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:21,067
There are many talents here in Omori.

405
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:28,074
We have an opera singer.Who is the opera singer?

406
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:39,627
We have a chef cook from Sydney Australia.

407
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,926
We also have an Olympic athlete.

408
01:18:49,095 --> 01:18:52,640
Who is the Olympic athlete?

409
01:18:56,436 --> 01:18:59,897
Who is the Olympic athlete?

410
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:42,315
Stay down.

411
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:26,359
You did not make it.

412
01:20:27,693 --> 01:20:30,488
You are worth nothing.

413
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:21,873
He draws, so we can restore before the Japs find something.

414
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:24,584
He has the largest part of the war mapped.

415
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:31,841
We are the Marshall Islands invaded.

416
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:37,972
The United States Marshall Islands invaded.

417
01:21:38,139 --> 01:21:41,768
The allies are gaining ground.

419
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:47,375
For boys who eat nothing We shit a lot.

420
01:22:49,836 --> 01:22:53,005
That is mine.

422
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:46,077
I killed him.
 Then they shoot you.

423
01:24:46,244 --> 01:24:48,371
I do not care.

424
01:24:50,873 --> 01:24:53,000
Thus we not beat them.

425
01:24:53,626 --> 01:24:57,672
We beat them by staying alive until the end of the war.

426
01:24:57,797 --> 01:24:59,757
So we do that.

427
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,511
That is our revenge.

428
01:25:04,637 --> 01:25:07,557
If I can, I make it.

429
01:25:09,392 --> 01:25:11,394
Exactly.

430
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:16,816
That said my brother, Pete, always. He believed that I could do anything.

431
01:25:16,983 --> 01:25:20,111
He thought I better was than I am.

432
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,657
Who says you're not?

433
01:25:43,801 --> 01:25:46,804
We are approaching.

434
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:58,418
Why have you forced me your store?

435
01:27:10,096 --> 01:27:12,723
You're dead.

436
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:20,314
In America they say,that is Zamperini death.

437
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:25,111
They have told your family, that you died in the war.

438
01:27:25,278 --> 01:27:27,280
NBC Radio said to America

439
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:32,034
"The famous Olympic rider Zamperini is dead.

440
01:27:35,913 --> 01:27:40,460
Do you want to tell your family,that you're not dead?

441
01:27:40,585 --> 01:27:45,006
These gentlemen are from Radio Tokyo.

442
01:27:46,048 --> 01:27:49,844
We have a program that can be heard around the world.

443
01:27:50,011 --> 01:27:52,680
It's called 'The Postman Calls'.

444
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:03,274
Hello, mother, your son is calling you.

445
01:28:04,275 --> 01:28:07,320
Mother, I love you.

446
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:09,906
I am alive and make it right.

447
01:28:55,827 --> 01:29:00,123
I'm just in my own words.
 Of Course.

448
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,731
Hello, America.

449
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:27,279
This is 'The Postman Calls'.Today the postman rings

450
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:31,158
to Mrs. Louise Zamperini in Torrance, California.

451
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,912
Louie Zamperini is not missing or dead 

452
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:38,373
as falsely claimed by your government.

453
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:42,085
He is safe and sound with us.

454
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:46,715
Listen, Mrs. Zamperini, and do not thank us.

455
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:50,552
The pleasure is all on our side.

456
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:57,643
Hello, mother and father,sisters and friends.

457
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:02,356
Here you speak Louie.

458
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,943
For the first time in two years you hear my voice.

459
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:12,032
I am unharmed and in good health.

460
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:18,580
I am now interned in a POW camp in Tokyo ...

461
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:22,376
get treated so well as can be expected in wartime.

462
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:28,840
I hope Pete every week on visit may come from San Diego.

463
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:35,222
Dad, take good care of my guns ...

464
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:39,226
so we can go hunting,when I get home.

465
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:44,189
And what rabbits can shoot for mommies gnocchi sauce.

466
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:51,363
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all.

467
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,704
Your loving son Louie.

468
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,741
You were very good.

469
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,996
You need to talk on the radio again.

470
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:46,668
BROADCAST SCRIPT

471
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,929
This I can not say.
 Why not?

472
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,222
Because it is a lie.

473
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:02,768
I can not say what there it is about America.

474
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:09,983
They have said it.Americans like you.

475
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:13,737
They live here quite comfortably.

476
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:16,365
Good food.

477
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:22,537
They get great food.

478
01:32:27,918 --> 01:32:31,338
Would you go back to the camp?

479
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,926
Say it on the radio.

480
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:30,480
You're just like me.

481
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:33,275
We are both strong.

482
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:39,410
I saw it in your eyes the first day.

483
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:44,870
I thought:This man is my friend.

484
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:54,546
But the Japanese enemy.

485
01:33:55,589 --> 01:33:57,841
You're not listening.

486
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:02,179
You do not do what you asked.

487
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:13,565
Respect is needed.

488
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:18,612
Without respect, no order.

489
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:28,205
This man needs to learn to respect.

490
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:32,626
All other prisoners should teach him that.

491
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:41,260
Every prisoner has the man beat in the face.

492
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:58,398
We can not do.

493
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:38,400
Do it.

496
01:35:46,325 --> 01:35:49,244
Hit him in the face.

498
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:58,295
Beat him.

499
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:06,386
Next.
 Come on.

500
01:36:06,637 --> 01:36:08,430
Come on.

501
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,687
Next.

502
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,942
Come on.

503
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:22,444
Come on.

504
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,740
Turn hard.
 Come on, hit me.

505
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:31,543
Next.

506
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:34,331
Hit me hard, Tink.

507
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,669
Next.

508
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,183
Come on.

509
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,522
Next.

510
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:54,142
Turn hard.

511
01:36:56,562 --> 01:36:58,397
Next.

517
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:57,849
Where's that naughty little worm?Have you seen her, buddy?

518
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:02,104
There you are, lazy girl.How should I get ready for the ball ...

519
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:07,401
if you do nothing? You just so little use if our dance classes.

520
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:17,244
Make my dress so baron Hillebrandt I notice.

521
01:39:17,494 --> 01:39:22,541
Nobody notices you, even though you fall in their lap. Do my hair.

522
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:28,380
Make my dress.Do my hair.

523
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:33,677
Her.
 I speak now Prussian?

524
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:38,599
You leave me all these stupid impossible things do without food or rest.

525
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:43,186
You lock me up in a rabbit hutch. I am fed up.

526
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:46,398
I have good news.

527
01:39:48,609 --> 01:39:50,819
I obtained my doctorate.

528
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:53,739
That's the good news.

529
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:57,034
The bad news?

530
01:39:59,453 --> 01:40:02,414
I have to say goodbye to my friends.

531
01:40:08,754 --> 01:40:12,424
I leave tomorrow Omori.

532
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,560
Stay cool and your heart in the right place ...

533
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:27,439
then you can do anything.

534
01:40:28,774 --> 01:40:33,862
Fear not, dear child.I'm your fairy godmother.

535
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:37,282
You can congratulate me.

536
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,784
And so it goes.

537
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:23,912
Just like that.

538
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:41,096
I have four kings.

539
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:44,016
Here You Go.

540
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:47,895
The baron has lost Tinker.Then there is sugar for us tonight.

541
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:45,577
Miller?Do you have a bucket?

542
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:57,923
We help the Japs?Let it burn.

543
01:42:58,173 --> 01:43:00,634
Pass it on.

545
01:43:16,525 --> 01:43:19,695
B49 boys.

546
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:25,784
Now it takes no more long.
 Restrain your enthusiasm.

547
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:28,495
If the Allies win

548
01:43:28,745 --> 01:43:32,332
shoot the Japs us all dead.

549
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:35,669
I've heard them say.

550
01:43:36,753 --> 01:43:39,548
If we win, we're dead.

551
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:45,429
Where should we pray for?

552
01:43:47,598 --> 01:43:49,923
Lie down.

553
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:58,025
Get your stuff.They move us.

554
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:04,406
Where To?
 Towards a new camp.

555
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:09,953
Tokyo Ritz. a place where the Allies could not find us.

556
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:27,961
This is Naoetsu detention.

557
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:34,176
I'm Sergeant Watanabe,your commander.

558
01:48:36,094 --> 01:48:40,766
You are enemies of Japan.

559
01:48:41,016 --> 01:48:45,687
And accordingly be treated.

560
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:55,030
You will help the Japanese by working in the coal mines.

561
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,825
Anyone who refuses to work

562
01:49:00,327 --> 01:49:02,996
is executed.

563
01:49:11,713 --> 01:49:14,925
Why are you looking at me?

564
01:49:20,771 --> 01:49:23,441
You can sleep here.

565
01:49:26,569 --> 01:49:29,321
You two there.

566
01:49:34,577 --> 01:49:39,165
It ends here, friends.Nobody knows you're here.

567
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:44,462
Reconcile but your destiny.

568
01:51:21,934 --> 01:51:25,479
Your President Roosevelt

569
01:51:27,690 --> 01:51:29,775
is dead.

570
01:52:57,363 --> 01:53:00,032
You alright?

571
01:54:23,157 --> 01:54:25,159
