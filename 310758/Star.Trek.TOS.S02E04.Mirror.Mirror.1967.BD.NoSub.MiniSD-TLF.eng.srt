1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,026
We believe what you say, Captain Kirk,
but our position has not altered.

2
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,609
The Halkan Council
cannot permit your Federation

3
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:20,076
to mine dilithium crystals
on our planet.

4
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:24,532
We have shown the council historical
proof that our missions are peaceful.

5
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:28,704
We accept that your Federation
is benevolent at present,

6
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:31,587
but the future is always in question.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,176
Our dilithium crystals represent
awesome power.

8
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:40,590
Wrongful use of that power, even to
the extent of the taking of one life,

9
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,936
would violate our history
of total peace.

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,768
To prevent that, we would die, captain,
as a race, if necessary.

11
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,360
I admire your ethics

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,484
and hope to prove ours.

13
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,617
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Spock here.

14
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:02,077
Report on magnetic storm,
Mr. Spock.

15
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,285
Standard ion type, captain,
but quite violent...

16
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:07,910
- and unpredictable.

17
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:11,460
- Rough ride?
- If we stay.

18
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:13,294
Stand by to beam up landing party.

19
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,256
Plot an extended orbit
to clear disturbance. Kirk out.

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,423
- Comply, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

21
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,517
When may we resume discussion?

22
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,308
The council will meditate further.
But do not be hopeful of any change.

23
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,230
Captain.

24
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:35,938
You do have the might to force
the crystals from us, of course.

25
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:39,108
But we won't. Consider that.

26
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:45,449
Enterprise.
Transporter Room, energise.

27
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,257
Trouble, sir.

28
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,038
Spock was right.
It was a rough ri...

29
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,970
At norm, Mr. Kyle.
Controls at neutral.

30
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,719
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,684
Status of mission, captain?

32
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,149
- No change.
- Standard procedure, captain?

33
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,831
Mr. Sulu, you will program
phaser barrage on Halkan cities.

34
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,789
Yes, Mr. Spock.

35
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:17,336
- Their military capability, captain?
- None.

36
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,970
Regrettable that this society
has chosen suicide.

37
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:26,007
Mr. Kyle, you were instructed
to compensate during the ion storm.

38
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:28,263
- But I tried...
- Carelessness with the equipment

39
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,432
- cannot be tolerated.
- But, Mr. Spock, I tried...

40
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,435
- Your agoniser.
- No, Mr. Spock.

41
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,152
- Your agoniser, please.
- No, Mr. Spock.

42
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,279
I tried, I really tried.

43
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:13,021
Space, the final frontier.

44
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:22,362
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

45
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:26,486
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

46
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:30,497
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

47
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,504
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

48
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,625
Captain's log, stardate unknown.

49
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:23,003
During an ion storm, my landing party
has beamed back to the Enterprise

50
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,632
and found it
and the personnel aboard changed.

51
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,385
The ship is subtly altered,
physically.

52
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,729
Behaviour and discipline
has become brutal, savage.

53
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,602
Mr. Scott, the storm has caused
some minor damage in your section.

54
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:40,063
There are also injuries
requiring your attention, doctor.

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,402
Well, gentlemen?

56
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,657
- Mr. Spock.
- Yes?

57
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,033
The power beam jumped
for a moment, sir,

58
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,909
just as the landing party
was about to materialise.

59
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,332
- I never saw it happen before.
- Due to your error, Mr. Kyle?

60
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,910
No, Mr. Spock. Before.

61
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,045
Possibly a result
of the severe storm. Captain.

62
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:01,250
- Do you feel any abnormal effects?
- Yes.

63
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,175
Dr. McCoy, you better look us over.
That was a rough beam-up.

64
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,089
Yes, sir.

65
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:14,933
Mr. Spock, have those
transporter circuits checked.

66
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,528
- What is all this?
- How did we get in this..?

67
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,608
Not now. Not now.

68
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,635
What is this?

69
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,923
Everything's all messed up,
changed around, out of place.

70
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:48,138
Captain, what's happened?

71
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:52,852
Well, not everything. That spot,
I spilled acid there a year ago.

72
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,228
- Jim, what in blazes..?
- I don't know.

73
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,643
It's our Enterprise...

74
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,730
...but it isn't.

75
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,696
- Maybe...
- Maybe what, captain?

76
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,700
Any of you feel dizzy when
we were in the transporter beam?

77
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:07,446
- Yes.
- When we first materialised?

78
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,328
- I did.
- It happened twice.

79
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:12,782
First, we were in our own transporter
chamber, and then we faded.

80
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,826
And then, when we finally materialised,
we were here, wherever this is.

81
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,124
Captain, the transporter chief
mentioned a surge of power.

82
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:22,921
The transporter lock might have been
affected by the ion storm,

83
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,885
and we just materialised
somewhere else.

84
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,679
Yes, here.

85
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,894
Not our universe, not our ship.

86
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,347
Something...

87
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:36,607
...parallel.

88
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:41,141
Parallel universe, coexisting with ours
on another dimensional plane.

89
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:43,029
Everything's duplicated.

90
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,740
Almost.

91
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,157
Another Enterprise,
Spock with a beard...

92
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:50,700
Another Captain Kirk,
another Dr. McCoy,

93
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:53,363
- another...
- An exchange. If we're here...

94
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,829
Then our counterparts
must have been transporting up

95
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,292
at the exact same time.

96
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:03,047
Similar storms on both universes
disrupted the circuits.

97
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:05,258
We're here, and they're...

98
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,715
...on our Enterprise.

99
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,007
Probably asking
the same questions:

100
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:14,102
"Are we in another universe? And if so,
how do we get back to our own?"

101
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:17,023
They'll use the computer,
and we have to.

102
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:18,566
What about the Halkans?

103
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,692
We can't let them be destroyed.

104
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:25,064
Scotty, can you
buy me some time?

105
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,150
Get below and short out
the main phaser couplings.

106
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,903
They'll think the storm
blew the circuits.

107
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,829
- Aye, sir.
- Then, get on this technology.

108
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,535
It's all we have to work with
if we want to get back home.

109
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,084
The intercom may be monitored.

110
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,410
Use your communicators
for private messages.

111
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:40,627
- Sub-frequency, and scrambled.
- Aye, sir.

112
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:42,458
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,664
Get up to your post.

114
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:46,381
Run today's communication
from Starfleet Command.

115
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,431
I want to know my exact orders,
and options, if any.

116
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,258
- Yes, sir.
- Bones.

117
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,261
Captain, I... I'm...

118
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:01,943
Uhura, you're the only one
who can do it. I'll be right there.

119
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,059
Yes, sir.

120
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,063
Bones.

121
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,905
Let's take a look at the library.
We have a lot to learn.

122
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,288
Mr. Chekov, phaser setting
for planetary target A.

123
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:23,127
Coordinates 712, stroke 4,
Mr. Sulu.

124
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,758
Port batteries locked.

125
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:56,993
Still no interest, Uhura?

126
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,162
I could change your mind.

127
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,417
You are away
from your post, mister.

128
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,296
Is the captain here?
Is Spock here?

129
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,763
When the cat's away...

130
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,531
- Communication status.
- No storm damage, sir.

131
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,193
All stations report normal.

132
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:34,359
You're ordered to annihilate
the Halkans unless they comply.

133
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,783
No alternative.

134
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:48,509
Phasers locked on target A, captain.
Approaching optimum range.

135
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,464
Commence fire, captain?

136
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,397
- Captain?
- Stand by, Mr. Sulu.

137
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:06,069
I...

138
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:08,820
I've been ordered
to check phaser couplings

139
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,899
for possible damage by the storm.

140
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,401
Do you have authorisation
from Security, sir?

141
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:14,657
Captain's orders.

142
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,367
I'll have to check
with Security Chief Sulu, sir.

143
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,912
Never mind, I'll attend to it.

144
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,594
- Kirk here.
- Phaser report, sir. No damage.

145
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,927
Very good. Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Kirk out.

146
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:46,769
Planet's rotation is carrying primary
target beyond arc of phaser lock.

147
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:48,854
Shall I correct orbit
to new firing position?

148
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,532
No.

149
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:56,071
- Lock on to secondary city.
- Aye, sir.

150
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:59,871
Lieutenant Uhura, contact the Halkan
Council. I wish to talk to them again.

151
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,284
- Yes, sir.
- Captain?

152
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,997
This is a new race.

153
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,585
They offer other things of value
besides dilithium crystals.

154
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,332
But it is clear that we cannot expect
their cooperation.

155
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,136
They have refused the Empire.

156
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,805
Command procedure dictates that
we provide the customary example.

157
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,893
Secondary target now moving
beyond our phaser lock.

158
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,304
Put phasers on standby, Mr. Sulu.

159
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:27,434
- A serious breach of orders, captain.
- I have my reasons.

160
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:32,062
And I'll make them clear to you
in my own good time.

161
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:37,495
Captain, I have the leader of the
Halkan Council waiting on channel B.

162
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:41,166
It is useless to resist us.

163
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:43,161
We do not resist you.

164
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:46,171
You have 12 hours
to consider your position.

165
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:50,420
Twelve years, Captain Kirk,
or 12,000.

166
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:54,045
We are ethically compelled
to deny your demand

167
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:56,179
for our dilithium crystals,

168
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,840
for you would use their power
to destroy.

169
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,891
We will level your planet,
and take what we want.

170
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,186
That is destruction.
You will die as a race.

171
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,765
To preserve what we are.

172
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,434
We will not argue.
Twelve hours, no more.

173
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,570
Close communications,
turn phasers off.

174
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,985
Aye, sir.

175
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:16,028
Twelve hours, captain.
That is unprecedented.

176
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,240
I shall be in my quarters.

177
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,875
Lieutenant Uhura,

178
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,129
have Dr. McCoy and Mr. Scott
meet me there.

179
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,888
Captain, you've placed yourself
in a most grave position.

180
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,552
This conduct must be reported.

181
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:46,222
You're at liberty to do so,
Mr. Spock.

182
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,407
Deck 5, sir?

183
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,417
So you die, captain,
and we all move up in rank.

184
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,515
No one will question
the assassination of a captain

185
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,848
who has disobeyed
prime orders of the Empire.

186
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,524
Captain's log, supplemental.

187
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,736
I command an Enterprise
where officers apparently employ

188
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,619
private henchmen
among the crew,

189
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:45,118
where assassination of superiors is a
common means of advancing in rank.

190
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,800
Your men, captain. Easy, Farrell.

191
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:06,347
- I did your job. Ask the captain.
- Sir?

192
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:08,804
Yes, he did your job.

193
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,060
Smart boy.
Switching to the top dog.

194
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,229
Get him out of here.

195
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,611
Mr. Chekov was going to make me
a chief, sir.

196
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,071
You could make me an officer.

197
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,411
- All right, you're working for me.
- A commission?

198
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,782
You're in line.
You might even make captain.

199
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,989
Yes, sir.

200
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,790
Not on my ship.

201
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,792
The booth for this one, sir?

202
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,841
Yes, the booth. Carry on.

203
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:52,479
Here. Here, what's this?

204
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,527
It's called blood.

205
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:58,567
Watch your step.
The officers move up by assassination.

206
00:15:58,742 --> 00:15:59,905
Chekov tried it on me.

207
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:03,363
Mr. Sulu is security chief,
like the ancient Gestapo.

208
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,579
And my Sickbay
is a chamber of horrors.

209
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,704
Two of my assistants were betting on
the tolerance of an injured man,

210
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,203
how long it would take him
to pass out from the pain.

211
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,876
- Report on technology.
- Mostly variations in instrumentation.

212
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:18,175
- Nothing I can't handle.
- Star readings?

213
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:22,178
Everything's exactly where
it should be, except us.

214
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,057
Let's find out where we stand.

215
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,566
- Computer.
- Ready.

216
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,071
This is the captain.
Record security research

217
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,731
to be classified under my voiceprint
or Mr. Scott's.

218
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,232
Recording.

219
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,783
Produce all data
relevant to the recent ion storm.

220
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:45,948
Correlate the following hypothesis:

221
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,910
Could a storm of such magnitude
cause a power surge

222
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:53,087
in the transporter circuits,
creating a momentary

223
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,877
interdimensional contact
with a parallel universe?

224
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:57,082
Affirmative.

225
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:02,379
At such a moment,
could persons in each universe,

226
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:06,602
in the act of beaming,
transpose with their counterparts

227
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,264
in the other universe?

228
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:09,767
Affirmative.

229
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:13,517
Could conditions
necessary to such an event

230
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:17,442
be created artificially,
using the ship's power?

231
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,274
Affirmative.

232
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,869
Record procedure.

233
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:32,287
Scotty, can you do it?

234
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:35,750
Not by myself. I'll need help.

235
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,205
You'd be too conspicuous.

236
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,803
I'm a doctor, not an engineer.

237
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,801
Now you're an engineer.

238
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:49,725
I'll have to tap the power we need
from the warp engines

239
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,055
and balance it for the four of us.

240
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:58,150
Jim, the way this ship is run,

241
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:01,240
what kind of people are we
in this universe?

242
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:06,532
Let's find out. Computer.

243
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:08,701
Ready.

244
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,293
Read out official record
of current command.

245
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,253
Captain James T. Kirk.

246
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,829
Succeeded to command
ISS Enterprise

247
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,843
through assassination
of Captain Christopher Pike.

248
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,716
First action:
Suppression of Gorlan uprising

249
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,095
through destruction
of rebel home planet.

250
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:29,264
Second action: Execution
of 5,000 colonists on Vega IX.

251
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:30,896
Cancel.

252
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,515
- Now we know.
- Captain.

253
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:37,564
- We can do it.
- Good.

254
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,193
We have to lay in
the automatic-transporter setting.

255
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:43,070
But when we interrupt
engine circuits

256
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:45,366
to tie the power increase
into the transporter,

257
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:48,538
it'll show up
on Sulu's security board.

258
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:51,198
Of course,
we'll only need a second.

259
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:56,204
I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to
distract Sulu's attention at your signal.

260
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,584
We'd better get back to our posts.
Keep me advised.

261
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:01,415
Jim.

262
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:05,299
If we're here, what do you suppose
our counterparts are doing

263
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,719
back in our universe?

264
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:08,761
On our Enterprise.

265
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,683
I order you!

266
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,272
Let me go!

267
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,900
Traitors!
Spock, get these men off me!

268
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,945
What do you think
you're doing, Spock?

269
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,239
You traitorous pig.
I'll hang you up by your Vulcan ears.

270
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,412
- I'll have you all executed!
- I think not.

271
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:36,335
Your authority on this ship
is extremely limited, captain.

272
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:39,506
The four of you will remain here
in the brig, and in custody,

273
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:43,340
until I discover how to return you
to wherever it is you belong.

274
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:46,383
Has the whole galaxy gone crazy?
What kind of a uniform is this?

275
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:49,013
Where's your beard? What's going on?
Where's my personal guard?

276
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:52,008
I can answer none of your questions
at this time.

277
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:55,687
All right, Spock.

278
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:57,685
Whatever your game is, I'll play it.

279
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,229
You want credits? I'll give them to you.
You'll be a rich man.

280
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,905
A command of your own?
I can swing that too.

281
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:08,280
Apparently, some kind of transposition
has taken place.

282
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:12,409
I find it extremely interesting.

283
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:17,129
Spock, what is it that will buy you?

284
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,424
- Power?
- Fascinating.

285
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:25,304
Power, Spock?
I can get that for you!

286
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,180
Captain.

287
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:35,475
I am pleased that you frustrated
Mr. Chekov's plan.

288
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,519
I should regret your death.

289
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,856
- Why?
- I do not desire the captaincy.

290
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,070
I much prefer
my scientific duties,

291
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,910
and I am, frankly,
content to be a lesser target.

292
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,319
Logical, as always, Mr. Spock.

293
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,790
The agony booth is a most effective
means of discipline.

294
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,181
I presume you've ordered
full duration?

295
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,810
I haven't decided.

296
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:16,855
Indeed?

297
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:20,274
- His act warrants death.
- I said, I haven't decided.

298
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:24,446
That is, of course, your affair.

299
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:28,066
Captain, may I enquire
if you intend to persist

300
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,450
in your unusual course of action
regarding the Halkans?

301
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:31,652
You heard my orders.

302
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,748
They are, of course, in contradiction
to standard Empire procedure.

303
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,206
You cannot ignore
the consequences.

304
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,499
Is that a threat?

305
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:45,045
I do not threaten, captain.
I merely state facts.

306
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:47,378
I have found you to be
an excellent officer.

307
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:52,308
Our missions together have been
both successful and profitable.

308
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:56,605
However, I shall not permit
your aberrations

309
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,730
to jeopardise my position.

310
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:05,018
Spock...

311
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,910
...do you think
we should destroy the Halkans?

312
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,198
Terror must be maintained,
or the Empire is doomed.

313
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:16,535
- It is the logic of history.
- Conquest is easy. Control is not.

314
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,536
We may have bitten off
more than we can chew.

315
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:23,420
Captain, I do not wish
to find myself opposing you.

316
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,880
But if you continue
on your present course,

317
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:28,175
this confusing,
inexplicable behaviour...

318
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,014
Is my concern, not yours.

319
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:35,515
You would find me
a formidable enemy.

320
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,763
I am aware of that, captain.

321
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,734
I trust that you are aware
of the reverse.

322
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,905
Orders, sir?

323
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,829
Release Chekov.
Confine him to quarters.

324
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,992
Yes, sir.

325
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,808
That ought to hold him
for about six hours.

326
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,555
I fell asleep.

327
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:59,724
We had quite a time in the Chem Lab
picking up after the storm.

328
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,654
Nothing compared to your day,
I gather.

329
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,993
I heard about Chekov.

330
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,122
He gambled. I won.

331
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,869
You got lucky.

332
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,456
I'm surprised that you could be
caught off guard that way.

333
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,206
I was preoccupied.

334
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,342
You're still in trouble
with Starfleet Command.

335
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,381
What you've got in mind this time
is beyond me.

336
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,850
You're scheming, of course.

337
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,392
The Halkans have something
you want.

338
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,229
Or is it all some clever means
to advance you to the admiralty?

339
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,904
Kirk.

340
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:52,322
- The cabinet itself?
- Further than that, if I'm successful.

341
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:53,987
Really?

342
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,790
Well, you must know
what you're doing.

343
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,784
You always do.

344
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,625
If I'm to be the woman
of a Caesar...

345
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,128
...can't I know what you're up to?

346
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,772
- Kirk here.
- Mr. Spock, captain.

347
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,278
Yes?

348
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:37,449
I've received a private communication
from Starfleet Command.

349
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:39,579
I am committing
a breach of regulations

350
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,788
by informing you of its contents.

351
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:43,581
Yes, Mr. Spock?

352
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,881
I'm instructed to wait until planet dawn
over principal target

353
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,923
to permit you
to carry out our mission.

354
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:52,918
And if I don't?

355
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,178
In that event,
I am ordered to kill you

356
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,771
and to proceed against the Halkans
as the new captain of the Enterprise.

357
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:15,984
Captain's log, stardate unknown.

358
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:19,159
We are trapped in a savage
parallel universe

359
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:21,952
from which we must escape
within four hours

360
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,743
or I will face a death sentence
at Mr. Spock's hands.

361
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:28,543
Let's drink a toast to Spock,

362
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:30,957
the only man aboard
with the decency to warn you.

363
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,712
And he'll die for it.

364
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,387
You'll never find
another man like him.

365
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,014
I don't intend to kill him.

366
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:39,852
Are you going to act against
the Halkans before the deadline?

367
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:41,429
No. But I'll avoid killing Spock.

368
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,356
Just get him out of the way?
He and his men?

369
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,024
I'll get out of his way.

370
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:51,027
Shall I activate the Tantalus field?

371
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,523
You'll at least want to monitor him,
won't you?

372
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:58,869
Yes.

373
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:07,878
I hate this thing.

374
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:16,965
- It's not that bad.
- Of course not. It made you captain.

375
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:20,299
How many enemies have you simply
wiped out of existence

376
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,054
by the touch of a button?

377
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:23,895
Fifty? A hundred?

378
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,314
And I always thought
that was funny.

379
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:31,236
The great, powerful Captain Kirk,
who owes everything

380
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:34,737
to some unknown alien scientist
and a plundered laboratory.

381
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:37,697
Well, if you don't take advantage
of your opportunities...

382
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,241
You don't rise
to the command of a starship.

383
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:42,904
Or even higher.

384
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:53,086
That magnificent mind of his.

385
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:55,335
But it can't protect him from this.

386
00:27:57,055 --> 00:28:00,091
I press it, and he dies.

387
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:02,716
Now?

388
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:11,892
You really mean it.

389
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,697
It doesn't matter.

390
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:20,700
If Spock fails his order,
he'll be killed anyway.

391
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:24,785
I'll see to it that the circumstances
of his failure will clear him.

392
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:30,916
You're not even afraid
of Starfleet Command.

393
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,302
Can your scheme bring you
that much power so quickly?

394
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,303
And what about me?
How does Marlena fit in?

395
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:50,150
How does Marlena want to fit in?

396
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:05,494
- Scotty.
- Scotty here, sir.

397
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,908
We have to get out of here
within three hours.

398
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:11,003
Spock has orders to kill me
unless I complete the military mission.

399
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:14,838
- We've got another deadline too, sir.
- Explain.

400
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:16,468
The two-way matter transmission

401
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:19,174
affected the local field density
between the universes

402
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:21,423
and it's increasing.
We've got to move fast.

403
00:29:21,766 --> 00:29:24,091
- How fast?
- A half hour, at the most.

404
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:26,013
If we miss?

405
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:28,760
We couldn't get out of here
in a century.

406
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,854
Now, we're ready to bridge power
from the engines to the transporter.

407
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:36,237
You've got to get down there
and free the board so we can lock in.

408
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:37,651
Give me about ten minutes.

409
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,863
I've gotta complete
a few more computations.

410
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:43,201
All right, I'll be in
the Transporter Room in ten minutes.

411
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,779
- I'll meet you in the Sickbay afterward.
- Aye, sir.

412
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,872
- Computer.
- Ready.

413
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:55,213
Explain computer activity
in the Engineering section.

414
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:58,135
A security research is in progress.

415
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:01,091
Who is conducting the research?

416
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,720
The captain and Mr. Scott.

417
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:09,431
What is the nature
of the research?

418
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:13,189
Program is classified
under voice-index lock.

419
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,871
Why are you monitoring
my communications, Mr. Sulu?

420
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:32,415
My security board has detected
extensive use of computer, Mr. Spock.

421
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,497
I was about to inform you.

422
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:40,005
It's not hard to guess the nature of
your order from Starfleet Command.

423
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,508
I suggest a connection,
the captain suspects.

424
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:47,435
He's working on escape
or defence.

425
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:49,761
That is my concern.

426
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:54,268
Correct, it's your play.
I hope you succeed,

427
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:57,563
because the order
would fall on me next.

428
00:30:57,738 --> 00:31:02,815
And you know how Captain Kirk's
enemies have a habit of...

429
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,369
...disappearing.

430
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,164
If I am successful, you see yourself
a step nearer to the captaincy.

431
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:13,329
I do not want
to command the Enterprise.

432
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,497
But if it should befall me,

433
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,465
I suggest you remember

434
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,216
that my operatives
would avenge my death.

435
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,053
And some of them

436
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,634
are Vulcans.

437
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,064
Oiling my traps, darling.

438
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:47,614
I'm afraid
I'm a little out of practise.

439
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:50,405
Maybe that's what happened to us.

440
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,501
It's very hard for a working officer
to shine as a woman every minute.

441
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:01,672
- And you demand perfection.
- I've never seen perfection.

442
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:04,926
But no woman could
come closer to it.

443
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,267
I remember when
you used to talk that way.

444
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,853
- I still do.
- Prove it.

445
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,537
- I've gotta go.
- Ship's business?

446
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,198
An important task
on the crew deck?

447
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:41,876
Well, I guess it's over.

448
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:47,007
Commander Kenner will take me
temporarily. He's made that quite clear.

449
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,468
I'll call a yeoman
to help me with my things.

450
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:52,388
You don't have to do that.

451
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:56,224
Are you feeling sorry for me?

452
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:04,734
Do I see hesitation in your eyes,
about anything?

453
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,324
I want one thing, captain:

454
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:09,694
Transfer me.

455
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,245
On the Enterprise,
I am humiliated.

456
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:14,956
On another ship,
I can hunt fresh game.

457
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,836
I've got my rank, and...

458
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,048
Don't I?

459
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:26,050
I've been a captain's woman
and I like it.

460
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:29,093
I'll be one again, if I have to go
though every officer in the fleet.

461
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:32,310
You could.

462
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:37,649
I simply meant...

463
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:41,606
...that you could be
anything you want to be.

464
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:08,889
It's been a long time
since you've kissed me like that.

465
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:12,185
You're a stranger.

466
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:17,146
Mercy to the Halkans,
mercy to Spock,

467
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:18,810
to me.

468
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,812
Am I your woman?

469
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:31,278
You're the captain's woman
until he says you're not.

470
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,022
Uhura.

471
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,192
Yes, captain.

472
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,696
Scotty's signal should be
coming through any moment now.

473
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:16,993
- You know what to do.
- I've got a pretty good idea, sir.

474
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:21,711
- Keep Sulu's attention off that board.
- I'll do my best, sir.

475
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:23,340
Good luck. Kirk out.

476
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:48,195
You aren't very persistent,
Mr. Sulu.

477
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:51,866
The game has rules.
You're ignoring them.

478
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,742
I protest, and you come back.

479
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:00,670
You didn't come back.

480
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:08,256
- Now you're making sense.
- I was getting bored.

481
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:13,300
Of course, this isn't the time.

482
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,848
Any time's a good time.

483
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:26,605
I'm afraid
I changed my mind again.

484
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:30,618
You take a lot of chances,
lieutenant.

485
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,943
So do you, mister.

486
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:35,245
So do you.

487
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,961
Take over for me.

488
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:58,134
Mr. Scott.

489
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:00,222
All clear. On my way to Sickbay.

490
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,314
Now it's up to the captain.

491
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,738
You will please
restrict your movements, captain.

492
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,158
What are you doing?

493
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,460
Are you gonna shoot me now, Spock?
I thought I had until dawn.

494
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:23,668
I shall make that decision.

495
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,831
Since you returned
from the planet,

496
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:29,293
you have behaved in a most atypical
and illogical manner.

497
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:32,673
- I want to know why.
- Shoot. You're wasting time.

498
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:35,006
I shall not waste time with you.

499
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:39,098
You're too inflexible, too disciplined,
once you've made up your mind.

500
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,391
But Dr. McCoy has a plenitude
of human weaknesses.

501
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:45,187
Sentimental, soft.

502
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,816
You may not tell me
what I want to know,

503
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:49,482
but he will.

504
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:52,197
You're running a big risk, Spock.

505
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:54,656
I have the phaser, captain.

506
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:57,236
And I do not intend
to simply disappear

507
00:37:57,414 --> 00:38:00,534
as so many of your opponents have
in the past.

508
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:03,579
If you please.

509
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,035
Sickbay.

510
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:18,300
Yes, of course.
The entire landing party.

511
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:21,977
Captain, stand over there.
Doctor, it is time for answers.

512
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,607
How much time, Scotty?

513
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,361
Hardly 15 minutes, sir.

514
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:17,445
The field density
between the two universes

515
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,364
is starting to close very fast.

516
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:21,615
Help me get him on the table.

517
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:23,995
Come on, help me get him
on the table!

518
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:25,711
He'll die without
immediate treatment.

519
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:39,798
Everything laid in, Scotty?

520
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,646
The time lag, so the operator can get
into the transporter chamber?

521
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,355
All laid in, sir.

522
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:48,058
Come on, McCoy, we're taking
a chance on not getting back home.

523
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:51,272
We'll get home.
This won't take long.

524
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,820
Fourteen minutes. We've got to go!

525
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,818
You shut up!

526
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,108
I can save his life.

527
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:03,242
Do you want me to stop, Jim?
It'll only take a minute.

528
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:06,580
He is very much
like our own Mr. Spock, isn't he?

529
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:08,458
You've got that minute.

530
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,421
A little time, he'll live.

531
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,842
What is this, Mr. Sulu?

532
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,052
Mr. Spock has orders
to kill you, captain.

533
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,638
He will succeed.

534
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,863
Apparently, you will also appear
to have killed him...

535
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,189
...after a fierce battle.

536
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,912
Regrettable, but it will leave me
in command.

537
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,754
Captain, we've barely got
ten minutes.

538
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:31,120
Let's go, Bones.

539
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:32,923
I can't let him die, Jim.

540
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:35,250
You get to the Transporter Room,
make sure it's clear.

541
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:37,669
- I'll be there in five minutes.
- No longer.

542
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:38,878
I guarantee it.

543
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:43,265
Now, go on, please.

544
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:11,787
Why did the captain let me live?

545
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:31,104
Our minds are merging, doctor.

546
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,893
Our minds are one.

547
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:37,027
I feel what you feel.

548
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,650
I know what you know.

549
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,661
A friend.

550
00:42:49,836 --> 00:42:51,461
Activate the transporter.

551
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:56,832
You saved us back in Sickbay,
with the Tantalus field.

552
00:42:57,844 --> 00:43:00,514
- Take me with you.
- I can't.

553
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,845
I'm sorry.
Our power's balanced for four.

554
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:09,230
There's no guarantee
we'll make it with five. All could die.

555
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:12,270
- Scotty?
- It's working, sir.

556
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:16,442
- But there are only three of you.
- One is coming.

557
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,154
I'd help you if I could, Marlena.
Believe that.

558
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,337
If you kill us, you'll still stay.

559
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:44,468
Where's McCoy?

560
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:52,472
- Time, Scotty?
- Five minutes, sir.

561
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,726
Do you know what they'll do to me?

562
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,562
The power is cut, sir.
They're on to us!

563
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,031
- Auxiliary?
- Aye, it's available.

564
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:04,578
- Can you bridge to your setup?
- I can get us the power,

565
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:07,367
but the automatic setting is linked
to the transporter main.

566
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,248
If we bypass,

567
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:13,415
it means that someone has got to
operate the controls manually.

568
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:16,838
- One of us will have to stay.
- I'll stay, captain.

569
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:20,795
Get to the transporter chamber.
You too, Uhura.

570
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,680
Jim.

571
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:26,932
That's an order, Scotty.

572
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,271
Aye, captain.

573
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,269
What about me?

574
00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:39,144
McCoy...

575
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:45,783
I cut the transporter power.

576
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:49,489
It was necessary to delay
your beam-out until I could arrive.

577
00:44:55,881 --> 00:45:00,128
Engineering, reactivate
main transporter circuits.

578
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:05,635
You're a man of integrity
in both universes, Mr. Spock.

579
00:45:05,808 --> 00:45:08,512
You must return to your universe,
I must have my captain back.

580
00:45:08,685 --> 00:45:09,800
I'll operate the transporter.

581
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:11,686
You have two minutes
and ten seconds.

582
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:13,350
For that time,
I have something to say.

583
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:16,394
How long before the Halkan prediction
of galactic revolt is realised?

584
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:19,320
- Approximately 240 years.
- The inevitable outcome?

585
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:21,730
The Empire shall be overthrown,
of course.

586
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:25,822
The illogic of waste, Mr. Spock.

587
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:28,996
The waste of lives,
potential resources, time.

588
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:32,664
I submit to you
that your Empire is illogical

589
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:34,792
because it cannot endure. I submit...

590
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:39,503
...that you are illogical
to be a willing part of it.

591
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:41,917
You have one minute
and 23 seconds.

592
00:45:42,094 --> 00:45:44,799
If change is inevitable,
predictable, beneficial,

593
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:47,843
doesn't logic demand
that you be a part of it?

594
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:49,511
One man cannot summon
the future...

595
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:51,310
But one man can
change the present.

596
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:53,518
Be the captain of this Enterprise,
Mr. Spock.

597
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:56,774
Find a logical reason for sparing
the Halkans, and make it stick.

598
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:58,437
Push till it gives.

599
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:01,612
You can defend yourself
better than any man in the fleet.

600
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:03,359
Captain, get in the chamber!

601
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,650
What about it, Spock?

602
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,119
The man must also have the power.

603
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:16,037
In my cabin

604
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:18,039
is a device that will
make you invincible.

605
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:22,332
- Indeed?
- What will it be?

606
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,294
Past or future? Tyranny or freedom?
It's up to you.

607
00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:39,349
It is time.

608
00:46:39,903 --> 00:46:44,197
In every revolution,
there is one man with a vision.

609
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:49,242
Captain Kirk, I shall consider it.

610
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:18,851
- Spock.
- Welcome home, captain.

611
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,615
What I don't understand is
how you were able

612
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:28,777
to identify our counterparts
so quickly.

613
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:32,785
It was far easier for you, as civilised
men, to behave like barbarians

614
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:37,120
than it was for them, as barbarians,
to behave like civilised men.

615
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:39,086
I assume they returned
to their Enterprise

616
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:40,630
at the same time
you appeared here?

617
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:44,167
Probably. However,
that Jim Kirk will find a few changes,

618
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:46,301
if I read my Spocks correctly.

619
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:50,094
Jim, I think I liked him
with a beard better.

620
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,381
Gave him character.

621
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:54,311
Of course, almost any change
would be a distinct improvement.

622
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:58,020
What worries me is the easy way

623
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,480
his counterpart fitted
into that other universe.

624
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:03,143
I always thought Spock
was a bit of a pirate at heart.

625
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:06,488
Indeed, gentlemen.
May I point out that I had opportunity

626
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:09,612
to observe your counterparts here
quite closely.

627
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:14,828
They were brutal, savage,
unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous.

628
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,250
In every way, splendid examples
of homo sapiens,

629
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,339
the very flower of humanity.

630
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,046
I found them quite refreshing.

631
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:29,681
I'm not sure,
but I think we've been insulted.

632
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:31,426
I'm sure.

633
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,398
Captain Kirk?

634
00:48:44,196 --> 00:48:47,695
- Lieutenant... Lieutenant?
- Marlena Moreau.

635
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,193
I was just assigned last week.

636
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,575
All right, lieutenant. Carry on.

637
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,498
Met her before, captain?

638
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:05,836
Why do you ask?

639
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,924
Your reaction. One of recognition?

640
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:13,264
Oh, no.
No, no, we haven't met before...

641
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:14,679
...exactly.

642
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:17,978
She just seemed a nice, likeable girl.

643
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:20,982
I think we could become friends.

644
00:49:22,735 --> 00:49:24,229
It's possible.
