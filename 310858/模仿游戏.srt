5
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,341
你有在听吗？
Are you paying attention?

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,939
很好
Good.

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,259
我不会停顿
I will not pause.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,209
你错了
You're mistaken.

17
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,310
我在掌控
I am in control.

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,641
因为我知道你不知道的事
Because I know things that you do not know.

25
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,819
你能派个警察来吗？
Send a detective down, will you?

32
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,973
进来
Come in.

37
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,119
是你的
It's yours.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,328
请注意听
Pay attention.

41
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,268
图灵，艾伦
Turing, Alan.

47
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,146
他在曼彻斯特做什么？
What's he doing in Manchester?

52
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,461
图灵教授？
Professor Turing?

55
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,480
图灵教授？
Professor Turing?

56
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,415
退后一步
Take a step back,

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,543
他说有不少的骚动
He said there was quite a ruckus.

70
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,203
可是你说什么也没丢
Only you say nothing was taken.

71
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,349
很奇怪，所以不如你告诉我们
It's odd.So how about you tell us

72
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,281
发生什么事了，我们会找出是谁做的
what happened, and we'll find the chap who did this.

82
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,205
就像你说的，图灵教授
As you say, Professor Turing.

84
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,882
我会给你一磅
I'll give you a quid

92
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,260
我不认为这很可疑
I don't think this is suspicious.

99
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,307
战争爆发了！
War declared!

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,315
德国正在进攻！
German bombs on their way!

102
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,581
卖报了！
Get your papers here!

103
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,747
新鲜出炉的新闻！
Fresh off the press!

104
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,915
战争爆发了！
War declared!

106
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
德国随时进攻！
German bombs expected soon!

135
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,290
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,663
哦，呃，那位女士告诉我等着
Oh, uh,the lady told me to wait.

137
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,429
在我的办公室？
In my office?

140
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,503
呃，不，她没有
Uh, no, she didn't.

141
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,940
她显然没有告诉你
She obviously didn't tell you

143
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,480
她应该说吗？
Was she supposed to?

145
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,618
你是谁？
Who are you?

146
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,753
艾伦图灵
Alan Turing.

147
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,015
啊，图灵
Ah, Turing.

148
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,248
那位数学家
The mathematician.

149
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,914
是的
Correct.

157
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,942
你几岁时在剑桥成为一个研究员？
And how old were you when you became a Fellow at Cambridge?

171
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,135
哦，我想你不知道那是什么
Oh, I don't think you know what those are.

176
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,206
你为什么要为国王陛下的政府工作？
Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's government?

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,211
哦，我不想，真的
Oh, I don't, really.

178
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,180
你是一个该死的和平主义者？
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

184
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,192
政治不是我的专长
Politics isn't really my area of expertise.

185
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,694
真的？
Really?

192
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,436
在这个世界上？
In the world?

193
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,203
哦，是的
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,711
你知道我为这计划已经拒绝了有多少人？
Do you know how many people I've rejected for this program?

197
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,879
但我要告诉你，只是因为我们是朋友
But I'll tell you,just because we're friends,

199
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,455
我拒绝了我们国家的一个顶级的语言学家
I rejected one of our great nation's top linguists.

201
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,984
我不说德语
I don't speak German.

202
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,755
什么？
What?

207
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,603
我不知道，说德语吗？
I don't know, speak German?

208
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,174
嗯，我真的很擅长填字游戏
Well, I'm really quite excellent at crossword puzzles.

212
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,216
呃，谜
Uh, puzzles.

216
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,485
显然这是一个笑话
This is a joke, obviously.

219
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,864
祝你回到剑桥的旅程愉快，教授
Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge, Professor.

220
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,123
英格玛
Enigma.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,233
你叫我？
You called for me?

223
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,675
这就是你在这里做的事
That's what you're doing here.

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,843
你试图破解德国的英格玛密码机
You're trying to break the German Enigma machine.

226
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,349
你为什么这么觉得？
What makes you think that?

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,852
这是历史上最伟大的加密装置
It's the greatest encryption device in history,

231
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,826
这会变成一个很短的战争，显然的
This would turn into a very short war, indeed.

244
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,855
好的
Good.

245
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,894
让我试试，我们会知道答案的
Let me try,and we'll know for sure,

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,124
英格玛欢迎你
Welcome to Enigma.

253
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,044
它很漂亮
It's beautiful.

269
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,518
很好，图灵先生
Very good, Mr. Turing.

284
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,780
非常好
Very good.

289
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,793
每一天
Every single day.

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,344
我喜欢有自己的办公室
I prefer to have my own office.

299
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,350
你们是一个团队，而你是其中一份子
You're a team,and you will work as one.

311
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,543
呃，不，我不知道
Uh, no, I don't.

315
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,548
哦，看，又有一个
Oh, look, there's another.

316
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,849
我希望他没有家庭
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

340
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,742
我们要做的就是尝试每一种可能性
All we had to do was try each one.

346
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,562
早上好
Good morning.

354
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,502
我饿了
I'm famished.

361
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,894
我说我们去吃午饭
I said we're going to get some lunch.

362
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,074
艾伦？
Alan?

370
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,348
你说你要去吃午饭。
You said you were going to get some lunch.

371
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,514
我哪里得罪你了？
Have I offended you in some way?

372
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,853
你怎么会这么想？
Why would you think that?

373
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,519
你要跟我们一起吃午餐吗？
Would you like to come to lunch with us?

375
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,690
就是一个该死的三明治
it's a bleeding sandwich.

377
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,532
哦，我不喜欢三明治
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

378
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,898
算了
Never mind.

379
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,732
你知道，
You know,

386
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,617
我们已经解密的一些德国的消息
We have decrypted a number of German messages

390
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,627
我正在设计的机器
I'm designing a machine

393
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,567
谁饿了？
Who's hungry?

394
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,733
我们走吧
Let's go.

396
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,778
什么？
What?

397
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,913
彼得问谁饿了
Peter asked who was hungry.

409
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,315
嗯，好吧，我会冷静
Yeah, well, I will come down.

411
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,172
对不起，我想看一些文件，如果我可以的话
Pardon me, I'd like to see some documents, if I may.

416
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,918
这是不可接受的
This is unacceptable.

420
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,719
投诉？
Complaint?

429
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,570
我不得不把他们带回内政部
I shall have to take it up with the Home Office.

431
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,748
好的，我的回答是他们都是白痴
Fine, my response is they're all idiots.

432
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,815
解雇他们用剩下的钱来资助我的机器
Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine.

435
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,452
你为什么要造一个机器？
Why are you building a machine?

437
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,626
我建议你还是试着说清楚
I suggest you make the effort to try.

440
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,603
我们的问题是我们只能用人尝试去击败它
Our problem is that we're only using men to try to beat it.

443
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,812
嗯，也不是很高科技
Well, that's not very technical.

447
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,451
你有没有赢过一场战争，图灵？
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

448
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,487
我有
I have.

450
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,653
秩序，纪律，
Order, discipline,

452
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,088
你不再是在大学
You're not at university any longer.

455
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,334
好的
Yes.

463
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,614
孟席斯先生！
Mr. Menzies!

464
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,990
孟席斯先生！
Mr. Menzies!

466
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,397
可能会
Possibly.

467
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,004
你能为我送一封信？
Would you deliver a letter for me?

468
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,803
看，我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry,

469
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,276
但是，你在开玩笑吗？
but are you joking?

473
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,855
我恨这样说，不过是的
I hate to say it, but yes.

474
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,855
太好了，基思和查尔斯，你们被解雇了
Excellent. Keith and Charles,you're both fired.

478
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,897
艾伦，你不能开除基思和查尔斯
Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.

479
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,431
嗯，他刚刚说我可以
Well, he just said I could.

480
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,830
不，我没有这样说
No, I did no such thing.

483
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,115
见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

484
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,712
嗯
Well,

490
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,708
胡萝卜是橙色的
Carrots are orange.

508
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,995
图灵？
Tuflng?

510
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,668
别像个犹太人一样
Don't be such a kike about it.

513
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,149
我没有靠我自己学会这个
I didn't learn this on my own,

514
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,716
当然
of course.

520
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,623
这不是我的错
It's not my fault.

523
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,167
我不会让他们再这样做了
I won't let them do it again.

526
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,907
不，他们打你因为你不同
No, they beat you up because you're different.

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,139
妈妈说，我只是一个怪胎
Mother says I'm just an odd duck.

528
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,340
她是对的
she's right.

531
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,229
那，我们现在做什么？
So, what do we do now?

532
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,392
我们人手不够
We're short on staff.

547
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,689
呃，艾伦图灵
Um, Alan Turing

551
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,594
哦，各种各样，真的
Oh, all sorts, really.

552
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,392
有老师，工程师
Teacher, an engineer,

560
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,245
你可以在上面做笔记
You are to make notes in that.

561
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,940
先生们，你们有六分钟的时间
Gentlemen, you have six minutes

564
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,215
对不起，夫人，这个房间不能随便进入
Pardon, ma'am,this room's restricted.

565
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,722
哦，不好意思我迟到了
Oh, apologies for my tardiness.

569
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,325
哦，但我只迟到了几分钟
Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late.

571
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,760
这个房间只对候选人开放
This room's for the candidates.

575
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,904
信中没有说具体
The letter didn't say precisely.

583
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,582
我的名字是琼 克拉克
My name's Joan Clarke.

584
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:56,422
小姐，你真的是自己解开这个难题吗？
Miss, did you really solve this puzzle yourself?

585
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,264
是什么让你认为我不能自己解开？
What makes you think I couldn't solve the puzzle myself?

591
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,182
谢谢
Thank you.

592
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,277
现在，嗯
Now, um,

595
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,489
嗯，先生们和夫人
Uh, gentlemen and lady,

598
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,717
六分钟
Six minutes.

599
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,156
这可能吗？
Is that even possible?

606
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,906
你完成了？
You've finished?

607
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,067
是的。
Yes.

608
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,754
5分34秒
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

1071
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,577
指挥官，至少给我们一些时间

他犯了罪，并且做了违法的事

00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,991

Wait.

1136
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,883

怎么了？
What?

00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,839
我25岁，未婚，独自生活
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,I'm living alone,

1148
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,402
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

1149
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,173
这就是我的父母
That's my parents.

1160
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,236
我为你的孤独感到难过

01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,417
如果你有一个丈夫呢？
What if you had a husband?

01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,807
但是这是合乎情理的
But this makes sense.

1185
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,446
你是在向我求婚吗？
Did you just propose to me?

1186
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,241
嗯，这是顺理成章的事
Well, it is the logical thing to do.

1191
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,393
你的中间名是卡洛琳还是凯瑟琳？
Is your middle name Caroline or Catherine?

1212
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:37,114
轮到我了

What's the matter?

1233

我在乎她
I care for her,

1237
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,381
你不能告诉任何人，艾伦
You can't tell anyone, Alan.

1238
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,643
这是违法的
It's illegal.

1241
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,519
我知道
I know.

1243
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,484

1256

图灵先生，我可以告诉你一个秘密吗？

我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

1259
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,798
哦，显而易见
Oh, clearly.

01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,645
机器能思考吗？
Can machines think?

1263
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,110
你为什么这么说？
What makes you say that?

1267
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,957
那么，它们能吗？
Well, can they?

1268
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:48,199
机器能像人类一样思考吗？
Could machines ever think as human beings do?

1269
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,804
大多数人说不能
Most people say not.

1270
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,341
你不是大多数人
You're not most people.

这是一个游戏
It's a game.

1302

你所需要做的是问我一个问题

1312
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,628
战争期间你在做什么？
What did you do during the war?

1313
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,998
我在一个无线电工厂工作
I worked in a radio factory.

1314

该死的！

琼旁边的是谁？
Who's that with Joan?

Everyone types a touch differently,

可惜他有女朋友
It's a pity he has a girlfriend,

1406
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,697
太好了

我需要一份新信息

1554
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,691
你到底在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1572
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,427
我们要做的是理智的事
We have to do what is logical.

1573
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:07,261
什么理智的事？
What's logical?

01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,280
什么？
What?

1586
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:29,955
不

1592
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,837
德军会怎么想？

1611
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:34,247
什么？
What?

1628
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,370
我们不能

1630
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,242
他是对的

为什么？

你为什么告诉我这个？
Why are you telling me this?

你可以处理好那个

1668
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:42,870
所以你要相信这些数据统计是吗？
And you're going to trust all this to statistics?

1692
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,733
保密成为首要关注的问题
Secrecy became the primary concern,

1716
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:05,644
你永远不能再工作

军事监狱

1740
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,657
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1747

我知道谁是间谍

1752
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,827
天啊，我希望你是一个间谍
God, I wish you'd been a spy.

1765
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,620
丘吉尔太多疑了
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1770
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,526
太多的秘密了
so much secrecy.

1771
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:44,028
凯恩克罗斯不知道我们知道，肯定的

他不是什么聪明人
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1779
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,557
我认识很多间谍，艾伦
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1783
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,937
对了，琼在市场上
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1782
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,633
她会在一小时后回来，之前我撒了谎

1787
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:37,587
我们将会合作得很愉快
we're gonna have such a wonderful war together.

1795
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,146
你需要远离我
You need to get very far away from me.

1796
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,485
艾伦，发生什么事了？
Alan, what's happened?

1797
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,395
我们不能订婚了
We can't be engaged anymore.

1800
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,160
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

1801
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:27,840
我有一件事，呃，呃，要告诉你
I have something, uh, uh, to tell you.

1803
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,608
我是一个同性恋
I'm a homosexual.

1804
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:38,646
好吧
All right.

1812
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,060
但我们不像其他人
But we're not like other people.

1813
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,205
我们以我们自己的方式相爱着
We love each other in our own way,

1820
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,115
我要工作
I'll work.

1821
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:16,223
你也要工作
You'll work.

1825

01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,078
我没有

1831

我从来没有

1834
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,500
我哪儿也不去

1840
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:19,178
这是我能做的最重要的工作
This is the most important work I will ever do,

1843
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,852
你知道吗，他们是对的
You know what, they were right.

1872
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:04,452
但是战场对我们来说不是那样的
The war wasn't like that for us.

1877
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,937
你的胜利
your victory.

1882
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,585
这是一个庄严而光荣的时刻
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

1887
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:46,424
上帝没有赢得战争
God didn't win the war.

1888
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:48,626
我们做到了
We did.

1893
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:10,415
是的，差不多
Yes, pretty much.

1897
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,428
烧掉一切

1904
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:36,683
正是如此
Precisely.

1909
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:50,226
回家一路顺风
Have a safe trip home.

1912
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:17,722
难以置信
That's unbelievable.

1913
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,056
现在，警探
Now, Detective,

1914
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,392
你来判断

1916

我是什么？

1925

进来
Come in.

1927
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:12,941
你要见我吗，先生？

01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:53,418
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

1942
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:55,852
好吧，我听说他是你唯一的朋友
Well, I'm told he's your only friend.

1943
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:57,650
谁说的？
Who said that?

1944
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:03,429
关于莫科姆发生了一些事
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1945
01:40:03,598 --> 01:40:05,965
我为什么在这里？
Why am I here?

1946
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:11,299
克里斯托弗去世了

1948
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,711
我不明白

1949

他的母亲今天早上派人送来的消息

1950

他们一家人在度假，你知道的

1951
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,355

我很抱歉

1957
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:46,071
你搞错了
You're mistaken.

1958
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,709
他没告诉你吗？
Did he not tell you?

1959
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,504
嗯，他已经病了很长时间
Well, he's been sick for a long time.

1960
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,205
他知道这是必然的
He knew this was coming soon.

1961
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,908
但他还咬是坚持来上课
But he had a stiff upper lip about it.

1964
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,254
就像我说的，我不是很了解他
Like I said,I didn't know him very well.

1965
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,952
啊，我知道了
Ah. I see.

1967
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,593
我可以走了吗，校长？

恭喜你，长官
Congratulations, sir.

1973
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:00,271

他们会送你去监狱的
They could send you to jail.

1980
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:19,733
该死的
Damn it.

1985

药物治疗？
The medication?

1989
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:43,688
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1990
01:42:43,858 --> 01:42:45,121

艾伦，你不必独自一人去承受

2047
01:46:07,061 --> 01:46:10,122
我在火车上

01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,094
这个世界是无限美好的地方
