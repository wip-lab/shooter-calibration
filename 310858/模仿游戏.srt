5
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,341
你有在听吗？
Are you paying attention?

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,939
很好
Good.

7
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,448
如果你没有仔细听
If you're not listening carefully,

8
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,384
你会错过一些事情
you will miss things,

9
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,614
一些很重要的事情
important things.

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,259
我不会停顿
I will not pause.

11
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,757
也不会再说第二遍
I will not repeat myself,

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,521
你也不能打断我
and you will not interrupt me.

13
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,763
你以为是你你坐在对面
You think that because you are sitting where you are

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,528
而我坐在这里
and I am sitting where I am

15
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,571
以及对即将发生的事都在你的掌控之中
that you are in control of what is about to happen.

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,209
你错了
You're mistaken.

17
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,310
是我在掌控
I am in control.

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,641
因为我知道你
Because I know things that you

19
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,977
不知道的事
do not know.

20
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,277


21
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,650
曼彻斯特警察局，请稍候
Manchester Police Department,please hold.

22
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,655


23
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,122
我的窗户被打破
Windows broken.

24
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,658
房子被洗劫一空
Home's been ransacked.

25
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,819
能派个警察来吗？
Send a detective down, will you?

26
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,056
我现在需要的是你的
What I will need from you now

27
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,564
一个承诺
is a commitment.

28
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,500
你会仔细听，直到在我说完之前
You will listen closely,and you will not

29
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,901
你不会对我施加评论
judge me until I am finished.

30
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,837
如果你不能承诺这个
If you cannot commit to this,

31
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,568
那请离开这个房间
then please leave the room.

32
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,973
进来
Come in.

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,340
但是如果你选择留下
But if you choose to stay,

34
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,481
记住这是你自己的选择
remember you chose to be here.

35
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,276
从这一刻开始
What happens

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,579
无论发生什么都不是我的责任
from this moment forwards is not my responsibility.

37
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,119
是你的
It's yours.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,328
请注意听
Pay attention.

39
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,966


40
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,474
这些都是什么？
What's all this, then?

41
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,268
图灵，艾伦
Turing, Alan.

42
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,468
剑桥的教授
Professor at King's.

43
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,976
似乎是入室抢劫
Seems there's been a burglary.

44
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,615
哦？丢了什么？
Oh? What of?

45
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,511
嗯，好像什么也没丢，真的
Well, that's just it.Nothing missing, really.

46
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,845


47
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,146
他在曼彻斯特做什么？
What's he doing in Manchester?

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,312
做一些与机器有关的事
Something with machines.

49
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,061


50
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,332
一个国家物理实验室的项目
The project at the NPL.

51
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,399
我问了，但他不肯具体说是什么
I checked, but he won't say what it's on.

52
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,461
图灵教授？
Professor Turing?

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,505
努克警察，曼彻斯特警察局
Detective Nook,Manchester Police.

54
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,976
中士史泰利告诉我你家昨晚被盗
Sergeant Staehl here tells me you had a burglary last night.

55
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,480
图灵教授？
Professor Turing?

56
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,415
退后一步
Take a step back,

57
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,486
不要大力呼吸
and don't breath heavily.

58
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,851
-呼吸？         -未稀释的氰化物
- Breathe?      - Undiluted cyanide.

59
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,355
它-它只要
It-it wouldn't take

60
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,517
少量就能杀了你
more than a thimbleful to kill you.

61
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,663
啊
Ah.

62
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,230
真是令人失望
Disappointing.

63
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,696
什么？
Pardon?

64
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,734
我希望的不一样
L-I had hoped for a bit more.

65
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,496
中士史泰利，难道只是我觉得，或者你也感觉到
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me,or do you get the sense

66
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,662
我们被侮辱了？
that we're being insulted?

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,774
昨晚，你被盗了
Last night, you had a break-in.

68
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,536
你的邻居，斯普林博先生，打电话报告了噪音
Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,called to report the noise.

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,543
他说有不少的骚动
He said there was quite a ruckus.

70
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,203
可是你说什么也没丢
Only you say nothing was taken.

71
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,349
很奇怪，所以不如你告诉我们
It's odd.So how about you tell us

72
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,281
发生什么事了，我们会找出是谁做的
what happened, and we'll find the chap who did this.

73
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,749
先生们
Gentlemen,

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,354
我不认为
I-I don't believe

75
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,183
你们能找出是谁做的
that you could find the chap that did this

76
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,519
除非，呃，他走向你对你的脸吐口水
if, uh, he walked up to you and spat in your face.

77
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,422
我现在需要的
Uh, what I could us right now

78
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,690
不是警察，而是一个好的清洁女工
is not a bobby,but a really good cleaning lady.

79
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,697
除非你的车里有
So unless one of you has a-an apron

80
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,198
一条围裙，我建议
in your car, I suggest

81
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,099
带上你的文件报告离开别烦我
you file your reports and leave me alone.

82
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,205
就像你说的，图灵教授
As you say, Professor Turing.

83
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,244
祝你的氰化物好运
Best of luck with your cyanide.

84
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,882
我会给你一磅
I'll give you a quid

85
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,778
如果你能给出比这更加难以忍受的家伙的名字
if you can name me a more insufferable sod.

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,544
似乎有点勉强，不过，不是吗？
Seemed a bit forced,though, didn't it?

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,051
不知道你在说什么
Don't know what you mean.

88
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,780
嗯，如果你不想一对警察
Well, if you didn't want a pair of bobbies

89
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,651
挖掘你的私事
digging around in your personal affairs,

90
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,658
这是一个主要的方式来确保他们不这样做
that'd have been a stellar way to make sure they don't.

91
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,819
告诉我，你不认为这很可疑吗
Tell me you don't think this is suspicious.

92
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,260
我不认为这很可疑
I don't think this is suspicious.

93
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,422
一个神秘的教授为什么不承认
A mysterious professor who won't admit

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,398
有人已经从他家里偷了东西？
he's had something stolen from his house?

95
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,934
我认为艾伦图灵
I think Alan Turing's

96
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,073
隐藏了些什么
hiding something.

97
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,012


98
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,150


99
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,307
战争爆发了！
War declared!

100
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,453
80万个孩子撤离！
800,000 children evacuated!

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,315
德国正在进攻！

102
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,581
卖报了！
Get your papers here!

103

106
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
德国随时进攻！

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,530


108
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,346


109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,981
今天上午
This morning,

110
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,320

交给德国政府
handed the German government

112
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,891
最后警示
a final note stating that

113
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,124
除非我们到11:00前得到
unless we heard from them,

114
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,734
他们的回复
by 11:00,

115
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,631
不然就承认战争状态
a state of war

116
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,135
存在我们两国之间
would exist between us.

117
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,295


118
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,305
我现在要告诉你
I have to tell you now

119
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,001
目前还没有收到任何回复
that no such undertaking has been received.

120
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,306
因此
And that, consequently,

121
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,642
这个英国与德国正处于
this country is at war

122
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,148
战争状态
with Germany.

123
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,582


124
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,491


125
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,337


126
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,175
在我们大多数人的生活
For the second time

127
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,837
这是我们
in the lives of most of us,

128
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,416
第二次...
we are...

129
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,074
处于战争之中
at war.

130
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,949
……去寻找
...to find

131
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,056
一个和平的出路…
a peaceful way out...

132
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,228
请出示证件
Papers, please.

133
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,978


134
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,793


135
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,290
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,663
哦，呃，那位女士告诉我等着
Oh, uh,the lady told me to wait.

137
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,429
在我的办公室？
In my office?

138
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,470
她有没有告诉你可以
She tell you to help yourself to tea

139
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,664
边等边喝茶？
while you were here?

140
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,503
呃，不，她没有
Uh, no, she didn't.

141
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,940
她显然没有告诉你
She obviously didn't tell you

142
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,409
这是个笑话不是吗?
what a joke was, then,either, I gather.

143
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,480
她应该说吗？
Was she supposed to?

144
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,980


145
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,618
你是谁？
Who are you?

146
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,753
艾伦图灵
Alan Turing.

147
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,015
啊，图灵
Ah, Turing.

148
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,248
那位数学家
The mathematician.

149
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,914
是的
Correct.

150
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,356
- 我是怎么猜到的呢？               - 嗯，你没猜出来
- However could I have guessed?    - Well, you didn't.

151
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,359
你只是读了那张纸
You just read it on that piece of paper.

152
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,957
皇家学院，剑桥
King's College, Cambridge.

153
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,692
好吧，这里说你是个天才
Now, it says here you were a bit of a prodigy

154
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,131
在数学系
in the maths department.

155
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,273
我不确定我能评价这个，先生...
L-I'm not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...

156
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,430
-你多大了，图灵先生？             -嗯，27。
- How old are you, Mr. Turing?    - Uh, 27.

157
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,942
你几岁时在剑桥成为一个研究员？
And how old were you when you became a Fellow at Cambridge?

158
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,205
- 24       - 当你发表这篇我不太懂的
- 24.      - And how old were you

159
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,870
题目的文章时
when you published this paper that has a title

160
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,140
你多大？
I can barely understand?

161
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,648
-呃，23     -你不觉得
- Uh, 23.   - And you don't think

162
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,116
你有资格作为一个公认的天才？
that qualifies you as a certified prodigy?

163
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,085
嗯，牛顿22岁时发现了二项式定理
Well, Newton discovered binomial theorem aged 22.

164
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,350
爱因斯坦写了四篇论文，改变了世界
Einstein wrote four papers that changed the world

165
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,687
在他26岁的时候
by the age of 26.

166
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,953
据我所知
As far as I can tell,

167
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,256
我
I've... 

168
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,988
我勉强不能相提并论
I've barely made par.

169
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,462
天啊，你真严肃
My God, you're serious.

170
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,032
难道你喜欢我开玩笑？
Would you prefer I made a joke?

171
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,135
哦，我想你不知道那是什么
Oh, I don't think you know what those are.

172
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,793
如果这是在工作的要求，
Hardly seems fair that，that's a requirement

173
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,133
这太不公平了，你是？
for employment here, Mr...

174
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,240
丹尼斯顿指挥官,皇家海军
Commander Denniston,Royal Navy.

175
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,877
好的，图灵先生，我引起了我的兴趣
All right,Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

176
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,206
你为什么要为国王陛下的政府工作？
Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's government?

177
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,211
哦，我不想，真的
Oh, I don't, really.

178
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,180
你是一个该死的和平主义者？
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

179
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,649
我是..关于暴力的不可知论者
I'm... agnostic about violence.

180
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,016
好的，你知道
Well, you do realize

181
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,917
距离伦敦600英里远
that 600 miles away from London

182
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,024
有个讨厌的混蛋叫希特勒
there's this nasty little chap called Hitler

183
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,251
想对欧洲实行专制？
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

184
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,192
政治不是我的专长
Politics isn't really my area of expertise.

185
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,694
真的？
Really?

186
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,094
好吧，我相信你刚刚在英国军事史
Well, I believe you've just set the record

187
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,257
创下一个最短的
for the shortest job interview

188
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,869
面试纪录
in British military history.

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,435
哦，呃…
Oh, uh... 

190
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,538
妈妈说由于作为一个在世界上最好的数学家
Mother says I can be off-putting sometimes on account

191
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,606
有时我会令人讨厌
of being one of the best mathematicians in the world.

192
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,436
在这个世界上？
In the world?

193
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,203
哦，是的
Oh, yes.

194
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,711
你知道我为这计划已经拒绝了有多少人？
Do you know how many people I've rejected for this program?

195
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,009
- 不知道   -嗯，没错
- No.      - Well, that's right,

196
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,618
因为这是一个绝密计划
because we're a top-secret program.

197
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,879
但我要告诉你，只是因为我们是朋友
But I'll tell you,just because we're friends,

198
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,453
就在上星期
that only last week,

199
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,455
我拒绝了我们国家的一个顶级的语言学家
I rejected one of our great nation's top linguists.

200
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,821
比贝托尔特·布莱希特德语还要好
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.

201
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,984
我不说德语
I don't speak German.

202
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,755
什么？
What?

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,524
我不
I don't...

204
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,064
说德语
speak German.

205
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,895
那么，你是怎么解密
Well, how the hell were you supposed to decrypt

206
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,559
德国通讯如果你不...
German communications if you don't...

207
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,603
我不知道，说德语吗？
I don't know, speak German?

208
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,174
嗯，我真的很擅长填字游戏
Well, I'm really quite excellent at crossword puzzles.

209
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,936
-玛格丽特！    -德国的代码是一个迷
- Margaret!    - The German codes are a puzzle.

210
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,773
是个游戏，就像任何其他的游戏
A game, just like any other game.

211
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,574
- 玛格丽特，你在哪里？        - 我真的很擅长游戏
- Margaret, where are you?    - I'm really very good at games.

212
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,216
呃，谜
Uh, puzzles.

213
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,784
这是世界上最难的谜
And this is the most difficult puzzle in the world.

214
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,580
玛格丽特！
Margaret!

215
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,085
看在上帝的份上
For the love of God.

216
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,485
显然这是一个笑话
This is a joke, obviously.

217
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,217
恐怕我不知道那是什么
I'm afraid I don't know what those are,

218
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,259
丹尼斯顿指挥官
Commander Denniston.

219
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,864
祝你回到剑桥的旅程愉快，教授
Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge, Professor.

220
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,123
英格玛
Enigma.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,233
你叫我？
You called for me?

222
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,403


223
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,675
这就是你在这里做的事
That's what you're doing here.

224
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,506
在布莱奇利的绝密计划
The top-secret program at Bletchley.

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,843
你试图破解德国的英格玛密码机
You're trying to break the German Enigma machine.

226
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,349
你为什么这么觉得？
What makes you think that?

227
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,852
这是历史上最伟大的加密装置
It's the greatest encryption device in history,

228
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,117
德国所有的主要通信都用它
and the Germans use it for all major communications.

229
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,818
如果盟军破解了英格玛
If the Allies broke Enigma,

230
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,929
那么
well

231
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,826
这会变成一个很短的战争，显然的
This would turn into a very short war, indeed.

232
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,832
当然这是你的工作
Of course that's what you're working on.

233
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,596
但你还没得到任何头绪
But you also haven't got anywhere with it.

234
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,136
如果你有，你就不会从
If you had, you wouldn't be hiring cryptographers

235
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,138
大学招聘解密者
out of university.

236
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,299
你需要我比我更需要你
Y- You need me a lot more than I need you.

237
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,377
我喜欢解决问题
L-I like solving problems,

238
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,139
指挥官
Commander.

239
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:25,046
而英格玛是世界上最难的问题
And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.

240
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,516
不，英格玛并不难；是不可破解的
No, Enigma isn't difficult;it's impossible.

241
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,985
美军，俄军，法军
The Americans, the Russians,the French,

242
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,181
德军，每个都认为英格玛
the Germans,everyone thinks Enigma

243
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,416
是牢不可破的
is unbreakable.

244
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,855
好的
Good.

245
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,894
让我试试，我们会知道答案的
Let me try,and we'll know for sure,

246
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,326
不是吗？
won't we?

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,124
英格玛欢迎你
Welcome to Enigma.

248
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,969
所有突然袭击的细节
The details of every surprise attack,

249
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,667
所有秘密护航的任务
every secret convoy

250
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,005
所有在大西洋的深海潜艇的
and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic

251
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,908
都输入在里面
go into that thing.

252
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,312
然后吐出无意义数据
And out comes gibberish.

253
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,044
它很漂亮
It's beautiful.

254
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,054
这是死亡的狡猾操作手
It's the crooked hand of death itself.

255
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,354
皇家女子海军每天拦截无线电信息成千上万
Our Wrens intercept thousands of radio messages a day,

256
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,519
对于这些可爱的年轻女士
and to the lovely young ladies

257
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,597
这都是胡说八道
of the Women's Royal Navy,they're nonsense.

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,700
只有当你把这些返回到英格玛
It's only when you feed them back into Enigma

259
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,064
他们才使它有意义
that they make any sense.

260
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,228
但我们只有一个英格玛密码机
But we have an Enigma machine.

261
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,600
没错，波兰情报局
Yes, Polish Intelligence

262
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,865
从柏林偷的
smuggled it out of Berlin.

263
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,031
有什么问题吗？
So what's the problem?

264
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,438
把截获的消息
Just put the intercepted messages

265
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,601
返回到英格玛就可以…
back into the Enigma and you'll...

266
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,440
没想象中那么简单不是吗？
Look, it's not that simple, is it?

267
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,777
只有一个英格玛密码机
Just having an Enigma machine

268
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,509
是不能帮你解码信息的
doesn't help you to decode the messages.

269
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,518
很好，图灵先生
Very good, Mr. Turing.

270
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,350
解码信息，你需要知道这个机器的设定
To decode a message, you need to know the machine's settings.

271
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,016
现在，德国会在每天早上
Now, the Germans switch settings

272
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,322
变换设定
every day promptly at midnight.

273
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,724
我们通常拦截的
We usually intercept

274
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,695
第一个信息在早上6:00
our first message around 6:00 a.m.,

275
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,459
在它变化之前
which gives you exactly

276
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:52,572
会给你每天18小时
18 hours every day to crack the code

277
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,935
破解密码，不然你得重新开始
before it changes,and you start again.

278
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,473
五个转子
Five rotors.

279
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,634
十个插接电缆
Ten plugboard cables.

280
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,210
-一百万…            - 几十亿…
- One million...     - A thousand million...

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,973
不，不，这是，呃，我知道了
No, no, it's,uh, I've got it.

282
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,446
这是万亿，这显然是几百万
It's million, million. It's in the millions, obviously.

283
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,484
这是超过150百万亿种可能的设定
It's over 150 million million million possible settings.

284
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,780
非常好
Very good.

285
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,481
159
159.

286
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,820
如果你想确切的说，1-5-9
If you want to be exact about it. 1-5-9

287
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,223
背后有18个零
with 18 zeroes behind it.

288
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,886
的可能性
Possibilities.

289
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,793
每一天
Every single day.

290
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,458
先生们，休 亚力山大
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

291
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,330
我亲自选择了他
I personally selected him

292
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,768
-管理这个团队         -你是不是…
- to run this unit.   - Didn't you...

293
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,907
亚力山大先生赢得了英国的全国象棋锦标赛
Mr. Alexander won Britain's national chess championship.

294
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,474
两次
Twice.

295
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,974
你不是这里唯一一个
You're not the only one

296
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,340
擅长游戏的，图灵
who's good at games around here, Turing.

297
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,005
我们今后要一起工作吗？
Are-are we to work together, then?

298
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,344
我喜欢有自己的办公室
I prefer to have my own office.

299
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,350
你们是一个团队，而你是其中一份子
You're a team,and you will work as one.

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,852
我不想花时间解释我自己的思路
I-I-I don't have time to explain myself as I go along,

301
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,615
我怕这些人
and I'm afraid these men

302
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,021
- 会拖累我                     - 如果你不能
- would only slow me down.      - If you can't

303
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,163
与我们一起，那恐怕我们不能让你参加
play together, then I'm afraid we can't let you play at all.

304
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,025
这是斯图尔特 孟席斯，军情六处
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

305
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,189
只有五个师的军事情报
There are only five divisions of military intelligence.

306
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,267
没有军情六处
There is no MI6.

307
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,801
没错
Exactly.

308
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,337
那是官方解释
That's the spirit.

309
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,304
图灵先生，你知道有多少英国军人
Mr. Turing, do you know how many British servicemen

310
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,465
因为英格玛死了？
have died because of Enigma?

311
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,543
呃，不，我不知道
Uh, no, I don't.

312
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,476
三个...
Three...

313
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,637
当我们进行
while we've been having

314
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,783
这段对话时
this conversation.

315
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,548
哦，看，又有一个
Oh, look, there's another.

316
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,849
我希望他没有家庭
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

317
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,323
指挥官丹尼斯顿谈论的这场战争
This war Commander Denniston's been going on about,

318
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,222
我们没有赢
we're not winning it.

319
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,022
破解密码
Break the code,

320
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,132
至少使我们有一个机会去赢
at least we have a chance.

321
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,860
我们让孩子玩玩独自
Shall we leave the children alone

322
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,561
他们的新玩具？
with their new toy?

323
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,830
嗯
Hm.

324
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,040
好了，先生们…
All right, gentlemen...

325
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,875
我们开始吧
let's play.

326
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,185
游戏很简单
The game was quite a simple one.

327
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,694
每一个德国情报，每一个突袭
Every single German message,every surprise attack,

328
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,488
每一个轰炸
every bombing run,

329
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,188
每一个即将到来的潜艇攻击…
every imminent U-boat assault...

330
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,333


331
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,669
他们都在空中传播
They were all floating through the air.

332
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,409


333
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,115
通过无线电信号…
Radio signals that...

334
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,220
好吧，任何一个学生仔只要有无线电
well, any schoolboy with an AM kit

335
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,947
都可以拦截
could intercept.

336
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,921


337
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,426
诀窍是加密的信息
The trick was that they were encrypted.

338
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,375
有159百万亿的可能性
There were 159 million million million possible

339
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,307
的英格玛设定
Enigma settings.

340
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,742
我们要做的就是尝试每一种可能性
All we had to do was try each one.

341
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,978
但是，如果我们有十人检查一个设定要一分钟
But if we had ten men checking one setting a minute

342
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,613
每天24小时，每周七天，
for 24 hours every day and seven days every week,

343
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,319
你认为它会多少天呢，呃，去检查
how many days do you think it would take to, uh, to check

344
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,897
每个设置？
each of the settings?

345
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,831
那不是以天计的，是以年计
Well, it's not days, it's years.

346
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,562
早上好
Good morning.

347
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,572
这将花掉2千万年
It's 2O million years.

348
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,471
-去阻止即将到来的攻击           - 谢谢
- To stop a coming attack,      - Thank you.

349
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,773
我们必须将这2千万的时间
We would have to check 2O million years' worth

350
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,677
精确到
of settings

351
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,012
在2O分钟内
in 2O minutes.

352
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,268


353
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,204


354
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,502
我饿了
I'm famished.

355
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,647
吃午饭吗？
Lunch?

356
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,146
天哪，那些戴小帽子的
Good Lord. What is it

357
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,182
女人是做什么的？
about women with little hats?

358
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,652
伙计，我们去吃午饭
The boys, we're going to get some lunch.

359
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,566
艾伦？
Alan?

360
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,168
嗯哼？
Yes'?

361
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,894
我说我们去吃午饭
I said we're going to get some lunch.

362
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,074
艾伦？
Alan?

363
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,231
怎么了？
Yes'?

364
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,843
- 你有听见我说话吗？       -有啊
- Can you hear me?         - Yes.

365
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,174
我说我们要去吃午...
I said we're off to get some lu...

366
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,475
这开始有点死循环了
This is starting to get a little bit repetitive.

367
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,015
-什么？           - 我问你
- What is?          - I had asked

368
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,515
要不要跟我们一起吃午餐
if you wanted to come to lunch with us.

369
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,085
嗯，没有，你没有
Um, no, you didn't.

370
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,348
你说你要去吃午饭。
You said you were going to get some lunch.

371
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,514
我哪里得罪你了？
Have I offended you in some way?

372
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,853
你怎么会这么想？
Why would you think that?

373
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,519
你要跟我们一起吃午餐吗？
Would you like to come to lunch with us?

374
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,425
 - 什么时间吃午饭？         -天啊，艾伦
 - What time's lunchtime?    - Christ, Alan,

375
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,690
就是一个该死的三明治
it's a bleeding sandwich.

376
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,595
-拿来干嘛？          - 当午餐
- What is?           - Lunch.

377
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,532
哦，我不喜欢三明治
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

378
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,898
算了
Never mind.

379
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,732
你知道，
You know,

380
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,068
要战胜这套天才的加密程序
to pull off this irascible genius routine,

381
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,835
采取的方式也得是天才式的，艾伦
one actually has to be a genius, Alan.

382
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,341
而我们
And yet we're the ones

383
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,570
已经有了进展，不是吗？
making progress here,aren't we?

384
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,907
哦，是吗？
Oh, you are?

385
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,106
是的，我们有
Yes, we are.

386
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,617
我们已经解密的一些德国的消息
We have decrypted a number of German messages

387
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,018
通过对字母的分布频率
by analyzing the frequency of letter distribution.

388
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,625
哦，即使是一个坏时钟一天也有两次正确的时候
Oh, even a broken clock is right twice a day.

389
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,591
那不是进步；那只是运气
That-That's not progress;that's just blind luck.

390
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,627
我正在设计的机器
I'm designing a machine

391
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,027
可以让我们每天即时
that will allow us to break every message

392
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,033
破解每条情报
every day instantly.

393
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,567
谁饿了？
Who's hungry?

394
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,733
我们走吧
Let's go.

395
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,069
我饿了—
I'm hungry-

396
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,778
什么？
What?

397
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,913
彼得问谁饿了
Peter asked who was hungry.

398
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,446
可以给我带些汤吗？
Can I have some soup, please?

399
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,607


400
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,979


401
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,588


402
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,087


403
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,627


404
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,978


405
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,903
你什么意思，“保密”？
What do you mean, "classified"?

406
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,905
不，我知道保密这个词的字面意义
No, I'm aware of the literal meaning of the word classified.

407
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,066
我问的是为什么一个数学教授
What I'm asking is why would a maths professor

408
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,678
他的军事记录需要保密？
have his military records classified?

409
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,315
嗯，好吧，我会冷静
Yeah, well, I will come down.

410
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,724


411
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,172
对不起，我想看一些文件，如果我可以的话
Pardon me, I'd like to see some documents, if I may.

412
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,570
图灵先生服役记录
Service records of a Mr. Turing.

413
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,767
艾伦
Alan.

414
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,276
外交部交给我的
Foreign Office sent me.

415
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,209


416
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,918
这是不可接受的
This is unacceptable.

417
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,954
如果你想讨论投诉
If you wish to discuss the complaint,

418
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,250
我建议你预约一下
I suggest you make a proper appointment.

419
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,415
亚历山…
Alexan...

420
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,719
投诉？
Complaint?

421
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,293
不，不，休 亚力山大
No, no, Hugh Alexander

422
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,897
已经否绝我申请配件
has denied my requisition for parts

423
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,090
和设备，我需要建设我所设计的机器
and-and equipment that I need to build the machine I've designed.

424
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,133
你的同事拒绝与你的工作
Your fellow code-breakers are refusing to work with you,

425
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,701
他们提出正式投诉
and they filed a formal complaint.

426
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,396
它的灵感来自一个古老的波兰码机
It's is inspired by an old Polish code machine.

427
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,303
只有这个是极大的进步
Only this one is infinitely more advanced.

428
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,772
如果你不回应投诉
If you don't respond to the complaint,

429
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,570
我不得不把他们带回内政部
I shall have to take it up with the Home Office.

430
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,110
把文件放在我的桌上
Put those files by my desk.

431
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,748
好的，我的回答是他们都是白痴
Fine, my response is they're all idiots.

432
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,815
解雇他们用剩下的钱来资助我的机器
Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine.

433
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,749
我只需要大约十万英磅
I only need about 100,000 pounds.

434
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,149
十万英磅…
100,000...

435
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,452
你为什么要造一个机器？
Why are you building a machine?

436
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,755
这是高科技，你不会明白的
It's highly technical.You wouldn't understand.

437
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,626
我建议你还是试着说清楚
I suggest you make the effort to try.

438
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,734
英格玛是...
Enigma is...

439
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,631
一个非常精心设计的机器
an extremely well-designed machine.

440
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,603
我们的问题是我们只能用人尝试去击败它
Our problem is that we're only using men to try to beat it.

441
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,673
不，如果有一台机器
No, what if only a machine

442
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,174
能击败另一台机器呢？
can defeat another machine?

443
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,812
嗯，也不是很高科技
Well, that's not very technical.

444
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,344
休 亚力山大才是
Hugh Alexander is in charge

445
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,846
你的主管；他说不，那就是不
of your unit; he said no,and that is that.

446
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,451
我只是没时间了
I simply don't have time for this.

447
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,451
你有没有赢过一场战争，图灵？
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

448
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,487
我有
I have.

449
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,318
你知道如何做？
Do you know how it's done?

450
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,653
秩序，纪律，
Order, discipline,

451
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,295
严格服从
chain of command.

452
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,088
你不再是在大学
You're not at university any longer.

453
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,665
你是一个非常大的系统的一个非常小的齿轮
You are a very small cog in a very large system.

454
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,360
你要服从你上级的命令
And you will do as your commanding officer instructs.

455
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,334
好的
Yes.

456
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,200


457
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,536
谁是你们的指挥官？
Who-who is your commanding officer?

458
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,542
温斯顿丘吉尔
Winston Churchill,

459
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,975

You have a problem with my decision,

462
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,846
你可以去找他
you can take it up with him.

463
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,614
孟席斯先生！
Mr. Menzies!

464
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,990
孟席斯先生！
Mr. Menzies!

465
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,463
你会去伦敦吗？
A-A-Are you going to London?

466
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,397
可能会
Possibly.

467
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:53,004

看，我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry,

00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,276
但是，你在开玩笑吗？
but are you joking?

470
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,505
丘吉尔让艾伦主管？
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

471
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,208
- 这是一个可怕的决定         -不，不，不，不，不行。
- This is a terrible idea.   - No, no, no, no, no.

472
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,752
所以我可以给这些人下命令？
So I can give these men orders now?

473
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,855
我恨这样说，不过是的
I hate to say it, but yes.

474
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,855
太好了，基思和查尔斯，你们被解雇了
Excellent. Keith and Charles,you're both fired.

475
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,354
-你说什么？    -什么？
- Excuse me?   - What?

476
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,824
你是平庸的语言学家
You're mediocre linguists,

477
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,328
可怜的解密者
and positively poor code-breakers.

478
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,897
艾伦，你不能开除基思和查尔斯
Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.

479
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,431
嗯，他刚刚说我可以
Well, he just said I could.

480
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,830
不，我没有这样说
No, I did no such thing.

481
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,528
但丘吉尔这样说了
But Churchill did.

482
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,008


483
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,115
见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

484
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,712
嗯
Well,

485
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,584
这是不人道的
this is inhuman.

486
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,283
即使是你
Even for you.

487
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,194
在学校受欢迎，是吗？
Popular at school, were you?

488
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,529
问题出现，当然
The problem began, of course,

489
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,698
从胡萝卜开始
with the carrots.

490
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,708
胡萝卜是橙色的
Carrots are orange.

491
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,243
豌豆
And peas

492
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,608
是绿色的
are green.

493
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,613
他们不能混在一起
They mustn't touch.

494
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,622


495
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,755


496
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,423


497
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,262
我来
I got it.

498
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,838
你知道人们为什么
Do you know why people

499
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,134
喜欢暴力吗？
like violence?

500
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,176
这是因为让人感觉…
It is because it feels...

501
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,336
很好
good.

502
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,641
人类发现暴力
Humans find violence

503
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,841
能带来强烈的满足感
deeply satisfying.

504
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,648
但除了满足感
But remove the-the satisfaction,

505
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,655
这些行为变得…
and the act becomes...

506
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,351
异常空虚
hollow.

507
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,495


508
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,995
图灵？
Tuflng?

509
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,193
拜托
Come on.

510
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,668
别像个犹太人一样
Don't be such a kike about it.

511
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,864


512
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,839
让他该死的在这腐烂吧
Leave him to bloody rot.

513
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,149
我没有靠我自己学会这个
I didn't learn this on my own,

514
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,716
当然
of course.

515
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,011
有人帮助
I had help.

516
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,645
克里斯托弗会帮我
Christopher helped.

517
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,322
艾伦，你还好吗？
Alan, are you all right?

518
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,824


519
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,895


520
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,623
这不是我的错
It's not my fault.

521
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,498
胡萝卜跟豌豆和混在一起…
The carrots got in with the peas and...

522
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,796
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

523
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,167
我不会让他们再这样做了
I won't let them do it again.

524
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,899
他们越来越狠了
They're getting worse.

525
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,510
他们打我，因为我比他们更聪明
They only beat me up because I'm smarter than they are.

526
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,907
不，他们打你因为你不同
No, they beat you up because you're different.

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,139
妈妈说，我只是一个怪胎
Mother says I'm just an odd duck.

528
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,340
她是对的
And she's right.

529
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,350
但你知道吗，艾伦
But you know, Alan,

530 
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,421
有时候正是人们意想不到之人
sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of

530
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,853
做出了人们意想不到之事
who do the things no one can imagine.

531
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,229
那，我们现在做什么？
So, what do we do now?

532
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,392
我们人手不够
We're short on staff.

533
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,935
那，我们，呃，就去找
Well, we, uh, we get

534
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,368
更多的人来
more staff then.

535
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,406
你打算怎么做？
And how do you propose to do that?

536
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,787


537
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,075


538
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,906


539
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,412


540
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,428


541
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,500


542
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,422


543
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,524


544
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,778


545
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,527


546
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,182

你认为他们有资格为布莱奇利工作
And you think they're qualified for Bletchley

555
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,563
是因为他们擅长拼字游戏吗？
'cause they're good at crossword puzzles?

556
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,730
嗯，他们说他们很擅长，现在我们就来测试一下
Well, they say they're good,and now we shall find out,

557
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,376

对不起，夫人，这个房间不能随便进入

哦，但我只迟到了几分钟

信中没有说具体

576

是啊，所以先上楼去找秘书
Yeah, so secretaries are to head upstairs.

是什么让你认为我不能自己解开？

不是秘密

630
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,914
和交谈有什么不同吗？
How's that different from talking?

631
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,957
- 交谈？            - 当人们彼此交谈
- Talking?          - When people talk to each other,

632
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,288
他们从不说他们的真实想法
they never say what they mean.

633
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,930
他们说的是别的
They say something else,

634
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,394
但是他们希望你能理解他们要表达的是什么意思
and you're expected to just know what they mean.

635
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,001
只有我不懂
Only I never do.

636
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,763
那么，有什么不一样？
So, how's that different?

637
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,405
艾伦，我有一个很奇怪的感觉
Alan, I have a funny feeling

638
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,475
你会很擅长这个
you're going to be very good at this.

639
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,853


640
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,834
晚安，艾伦
Good night, Alan.

641
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,443
晚安
Good night.

642
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,719
等等，玛丽恩，我来了！
Hold on,Marion, I'm coming!

643
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,860
通过这个小的设置然后沿路线返回...
Coming round the lesser settings and then route back through...

644
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,495
回到这里…
Back to those ones...

645
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,460
呃，小心点，好吗？
Uh, careful, will you?

646
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,190
嗯，这不是一个玩具
Um, it-it's not a toy.

647
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,697
有趣
Funny.

648
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,857
这看起来就像个玩具
Looks like a toy.

649
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,367
这就是那该死的要花十万英镑的东西
Bloody great 100,000-pound one.

650
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,165
你的新宠物的到了
Your new minion's arrived.

651
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,500
杰克 古德，我们见…
Jack Good. We met...

652
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,006
嗯，克拉克小姐在哪里？
Well, where's Miss Clarke?

653
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,476
很可爱，不是吗？
Lovely, isn't he?

654
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:14,484
这不只是个单调乏味的生产厂
It's not just a-a usual humdrum production mill factory.

655
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,814
我的意思是，嗯，就像我说的
I mean, well,as-as I was saying,

656
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,252
这是一个非常重要的，呃，无线电厂
it's a very important,uh, radio factory.

657
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,654
它不是，事实上，嗯，嗯，嗯
I-It's not, actually.Uh, well, um,

658
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,227
是辐射方面的，呃...无线电工厂
on the spectrum of,uh... radio factories,

659
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,058
这是一个非常特别…
this-this one is-is particularly...

660
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,667


661
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,601


662
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,841
你为什么不在布莱奇利？
Why are you not at Bletchley?

663
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,878
非常…感谢你的拜访，图灵先生
Thank you... so much for your visit, Mr. Turing.

664
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,244
-你旅途愉快吗？                -收拾你的东西然后我们离开这里
- Was your trip pleasant?      - Gather your things and let's go.

665
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,250
对不起，我无法接受你的提议
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to accept your offer.

666
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,388
我们认为这样一个职位
We feel that such a position

667
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,080
不是很适合我
would hardly be appropriate.

668
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,385
你获得了双第一在数学上
You earned a double first in mathematics.

669
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,358
但遗憾的是没有获得机会成为一个研究员
But sadly wasn't granted the opportunity to become a Fellow.

670
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,395
你属于布莱奇利
You belong at Bletchley.

671
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,999
我很抱歉，为了我的这个职位
I'm sorry,but for someone in my position

672
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,430
我需要...
to live... to...

673
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,470
离家很远去无线电厂
to work in a radio factory so far from home,

674
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,630
和你手下的男人生活、工作，呃...
with all your men, um...

675
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,936
那将...
it-it would be...

676
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,874
有失体统
indecorous.

677
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,941
那在这个世界还有什么意义？
What in the world does that even mean?

678
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:22,648


679
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,880
我们有一组，呃，年轻的女士
We have a group of,uh, young ladies

680
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,683
负责我们所有的
who tend to all of our

681
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,656
文书工作：助理，翻译
clerical tasks:assistants, translators.

682
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,229
嗯，他们住在一起，嗯，在城里
Uh, they live,um, together in town.

683
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:36,459
这-这-这会是一个更，呃，合适的环境？
W-W-Would that be a more,uh, suitable environment?

684
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,503
嗯，所以我会在这些妇女中工作？
Hm. So-so I would be working amongst these women?

685
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,162
是的
Yes.

686
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,405
都是优秀的女士们，嗯，他们甚至还组织社会活动
Wonderful ladies. Uh, they even organize social events

687
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,911
在圣马丁教堂下的路上
at St. Martin's Church down the road.

688
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,175
嗯，真的，整个事情是非常，呃…
Uh, really, the whole thing is-is quite, uh...

689
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,579
怎么说…
uh, um...

690
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,084
端庄
decorous.

691
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,282


692
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,119
现在，你不会有不适当的安全检查
Now, you won't have proper security clearance,

693
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,024
当然，因此，呃，我们将不得不凑合一些事情
of course, so, uh, we'll have to improvise things a bit.

694
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,630
你为什么要帮我？
Why are you helping me?

695
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,698
因为现在在这整个世界
Because there is only one thing that matters

696
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,926
只有一件东西是重要的...你明白吗？
in this entire world right now... do you understand?...

697
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,467
就是破解英格玛
and that is breaking Enigma.

698
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,607
但是，图灵先生…
But-but, Mr. Turing...

699
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,833
你为什么要帮我？
why are you helping me?

700
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,172
哦，呃…
Oh. Um...

701
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,611
因为有时候正是人们意想不到之人
sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of

702
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,344
做出了人们意想不到之事
who do the things that no one can imagine.

703
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,822


704
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,338
先生
Sir.

705
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,496
这是什么？
What's this?

706
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,735
艾伦图灵的机密军事文件
Alan Turing's classified military file.

707
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,881
- 这是空的              -没错
- It's bloody empty.    - Exactly.

708
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,176
-这是一个空的信封                       -是的
- It's an empty manila envelope.        - Yeah.

709
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,115
嗯，你不是已经破案了吗？
Well, you've cracked the case wide open, then, haven't you?

710
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,516
艾伦图灵的战争记录的不仅是机密
Alan Turing's war records aren't just classified,

711
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,350
他们是不存在的
they're nonexistent.

712
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,424
那意味着有人销毁了他们
That means someone's got rid of them.

713
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,186
抹去档案，烧点一切
Erased them.Burned them.

714
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,558
是那个闯进他家什么也没有偷的人干的？
And that same person broke into his house and stole nothing?

715
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,161
盖伊伯吉斯和唐纳德麦克莱恩
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

716
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,700
怎么，写文章的间谍？
What the spies from the papers?

717
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,201
苏联间谍
The Soviet spies.

718
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,705
但首先他们是教授，不是吗？
But first they were professors, weren't they?

719
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,775
在剑桥很激进
Radicalized at Cambridge,

720
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,241
然后他们加入了共产党
then they joined the Communist Party,

721
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,107
对外办公，在战争期间泄露信息
then Foreign Office,then leaked information

722
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,112
给斯大林...现在
to Stalin during the war... now

723
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,683
你能想到我们所知道的人谁在剑桥过
can you think of anyone else we know who was at Cambridge,

724
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,753
而且在战争爆发时泄露了一些黑暗和绝密的信息？
then took up something murky and top secret when war broke out?

725
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,788
你认为这个艾伦可能是一个苏联特工？
You think this Alan Turing might be a Soviet agent?

726
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,119
我认为…
I think...

727
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,283
将要有很严重的事情发生
something very serious is happening

728
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,055
就在我们的鼻子底下
right here under our noses.

729
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,098
难道你不想找出它是什么？
Wouldn't you like to find out what it is?

730
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,637


731
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,747


732
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,333
欢迎，女士们
Welcome, ladies.

733
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,332
请跟我来
If you'd like to follow me.

734
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,130
有些人认为我们与德国
Some people thought we were at war

735
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,603
打战...是不正确的
with the Germans... incorrect.

736
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,106
我们分分秒秒都在战争中
We were at war with the clock.

737
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,769
英国简直快饿死了
Britain was literally starving to death.

738
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,675
美国人每星期会送
The Americans sent over

739
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,478
十万吨的食物过来，是的，每星期
100,000 tons of food every week,and, uh, every week

740
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,144
然后德国人会把我们迫切需要的面包
the Germans would send our desperately needed bread

741
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,914
炸到海底
to the bottom of the ocean.

742
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:49,253
我们失败都会在午夜时刻知晓
Our daily failure was announced at the chimes of midnight.

743
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:53,193
这声音萦绕着我们悲伤的梦想
And the sound would haunt our unwelcome dreams.

744
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,593
滴...
Tick...

745
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,790
答...
tock...

746
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,991
滴
tick.

747
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,660


748
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,267
真该死！
Damn it!

749
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,338
- 怎么了？                      - 到午夜了…
- What just happened?            - Midnight...

750
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,676
我们所做的一切都是无用功
all the work we've done today is useless.

751
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,114
哦，别担心，我们还有几个小时
Oh, but don't worry,we've a few hours

752
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,549
在明天的消息开始泛滥…
before tomorrow's messages start flooding in...

753
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,883
和我们重新开始之前
and we start all over again.

754
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,724
从零开始
From scratch.

755
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,122
我讨厌这样
I'm so sick of this.

756
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,820
花了四小时重装他的插板矩阵
Four hours rewiring his plugboard matrix.

757
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,158
昨天花了三小时
Three hours yesterday

758
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,323
在他的转子的位置上！
on his rotor positions!

759
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,231
-不要去那边                       - 听着，约翰，不
- Don't go over there.            - Look, John, no.

760
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,064
如果之前没人说这个工作无法完成
If this job wasn't already impossible before,

761
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,901
- 该死的现在就是              - 休，不要
- it bloody well is now.      - Hugh, don't.

762
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,009


763
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,702


764
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,649
该死的你和你那没用的机器
Damn you and your useless machine.

765
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,312
我的机器是我们获胜的关键
My machine is how we are going to win.

766
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,547
是吗？
Really?

767
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,552
这台机器吗？嗯？
This machine? Hmm?

768
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,992
你是说这该死的机器？！
Are you talking about this bloody machine?!

769
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,790
-休！休！休，不要！             -休！休！住手！
- Hugh! Hugh! Hugh, don't!      - Hugh! Hugh! Stop!

770
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,161

你这个傲慢的混蛋
You arrogant bastard.

771
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,766
你本可以帮助我们
You could help us.

772
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,098
你可以让运算更快，但是你没有
You could make this go faster, but you won't.

773
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,762


774
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,430
松手
Get off.

775
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,744


776
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,178
他是对的，艾伦
He's right, Alan.

777
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,443
在外面有...
There are...

778
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,610
有真正的战士在保家卫国
actual soldiers out there trying to win an actual war.

779
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,914
我的兄弟
My brother

780
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,581
在海军的护卫食品车队里
protects food convoys in the Navy.

781
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,524
我的表兄弟在皇家空军巡逻
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

782
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,096
我所有的朋友，他们都在改变
All my friends,they're all making a difference,

783
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,894
而我们只是……虚度光阴
while we just...while away our days

784
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,127
做无用功
producing nothing.

785
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,830
这一切都因为你
Because of you.

786
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,303
我的机器…
My machine...

787
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,911
会有用的
will work.

788
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,207
走吧，彼得
Come on, Peter.

789
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,929


790
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,974


791
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,078


792
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,914
你可以走了
Okay

793
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,426


794
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,796


795
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,439


796
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,371


797
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,453
琼？
Joan?

798
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,657


799
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,690
哦
Oh.

800
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,502


801
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,339
呃，你能不能...
Uh, will you...

802
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,137


803
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,871
你可不可以
Could you make

804
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,174
再大声点？我怕我的
a bit more noise? I'm not quite sure

805
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,373
- 房东没被吵醒                  - 哦，不好意思
- my landlady woke up.          - Oh, sorry.

806
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,712
噢，嗯，听着
Oh, uh, look.

807
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,752
我想这是尽最大努力能做的了
I think that's the best I can do.

808
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,320
天黑之后不允许有男性访客
No male visitors after dark.

809
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,082
那么…
So...

810
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,556
你给我带来什么？
what did you bring me?

811
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,161
开始吧
There you go.

812
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,693
给你
Here.

813
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,594
你知道其他男人会送花吧
Some men try flowers, you know.

814
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,258
这些都是真正的英格玛信息
These are actual decrypted Enigma messages

815
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,904
直接从纳粹截获的
direct from Nazi

816
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,300
最高命令
High Command.

817
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,768
“0600个小时
"0600 hours.

818
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,601
“今天白天天气晴朗
"Weather today is clear.

819
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,243
“晚上有雨
"Rain in the evening.

820
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,775
希特勒万岁”
Heil Hitler."

821
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,606
嗯，很明显，这个重要的信息
Well, clearly,that vital piece of information

822
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,509
会帮助我们赢得战争
is going to win us the war.

823
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,650
我感兴趣的正是加密
It's the relationship between the encrypted

824
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,582
和解密的信息
a-and decrypted messages that interests me.

825
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:13,349
我们可以找找线索，好构建到克里斯托弗中去？
Can we find a clue here that we can build into Christopher?

826
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,582
谁是克里斯托弗？
Who's Christopher?

827
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,784
哦，他，呃，他是我的机器
Oh, he's, uh,he's my machine.

828
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,429
你给他命名了？
You named him?

829
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,065
名字很糟糕吗？
Is that a bad name?

830
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,700
不
No.

831
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,933
不是，不管它了
No, never mind.

832
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,541
你是想建立你的通用机器？
Are you trying to build your universal machine?

833
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,606
我读过你的文章
I read your paper

834
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,978
- 在大学          -已经开这门课了？
- at university.  - Is it already being taught?

835
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,245
不，没有，我只是提前看看
No. No. No, I was precocious.

836
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,979
所以…
So...

837
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,987
你的理论上说有一个机器
you-you theorized a machine that

838
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,625
能解决任何问题
could solve any problem.

839
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,658
它不仅会做一件事，而是什么都会
It didn't just do one thing,it did everything.

840
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,921
不仅仅是可编程的，而且还能可重复编程
It wasn't just programmable,it was reprogrammable.

841
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,120
嗯
Mm.

842
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,561
克里斯托弗背后就是你的这个理论吧？
Is that your idea behind Christopher?

843
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,931
嗯，人类的大脑可以很快计算大量的数据…
Well, human brains can compute large sums very quickly...

844
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,267
即使是休都能做到…但我想克里斯托弗更聪明
even Hugh can do that... but I want Christopher to be smarter.

845
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,967
做一个计算，然后，呃…
To make a calculation and then, uh...

846
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,476
来决定下一步该做什么
to determine what to do next.

847
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,808
就像一个真正的人那样做
Like a person does.

848
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,643
想想看
Think of it.

849
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,581
电子大脑
Electrical brain.

850
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,346
数字计算机
A digital computer.

851
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,456
数字计算机
Digital computer.

852
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,654
嗯
Hmm.

853
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,124


854
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:27,265


855
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,007
怎么了？
What's going on?

856
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,701
发生什么事了？
What's happening?

857
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,005
不，不，不，不！别碰那个！
No. No, no. No, no, no!Don't touch that!

858
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,705
-退后              -这是我的桌子
- Stay back.       - That's my desk.

859
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,280
谢天谢地
Thank goodness.

860
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,042
我不想我们找了半天
I'd hate to think we were searching

861
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,550
- 却都是错误的        - 你在做什么？倒底发生什么事了？
- the wrong one.    - What are you doing? What's going on?

862
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,552
有一个间谍
There is a spy

863
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,053
在布莱奇利园
in Bletchley Park.

864
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,521
海军认为我们中的一个
The Navy thinks that one of us

865
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,784
是苏联双重间谍，艾伦
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

866
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,985
呃……为什么？
Uh...why?

867
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,462
我们在它被送往莫斯科途中截获了这个
Our boys intercepted this on its way to Moscow.

868
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,533
看起来眼熟吗？
Look familiar?

869
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,405
这是比尔密码
It's a Beale cipher.

870
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:12,874
加密来自一本书中的一个短语或一首诗或…
Encrypted with a phrase from a book or a poem or...

871
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,182


872
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,843
你不会认为这是我做的吧？
You don't seriously think I did this, do you?

873
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,079
双面特工是个混蛋
Double agents are such bastards.

874
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,190
孤立者
Isolated loners.

875
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,759
没有朋友或家人
No attachments to friends or family.

876
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,055
傲慢
Arrogant.

877
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,164
认识这样的人吗？
Know anybody like that?

878
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,491


879
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,637
我知道你不喜欢我
Hm, I know you don't like me,

880
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,239
但这并不意味我是
but that does not make me

881
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,239
苏联间谍
a Soviet spy.

882
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,242
没找到什么，先生
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

883
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,176
是嘛
Really.

884
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,509
嗯，好吧
Mm, all right.

885
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,118
虽然内政部现在可以保护你
The Home Office may be protecting you now,

886
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,550
但迟早
but sooner or later

887
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:59,121
你会犯错
you will make a mistake.

888
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,055
我不必费心解雇你
And I needn't bother firing you.

889
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,355
他们会以叛国罪绞死你
They will hang you for treason.

890
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,936


891
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,978
嗨
Hello.

892
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,118
我知道今天的事了
I heard about what happened.

893
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:35,089
这是三组女孩唯一可以谈论的事
It's all the girls in Hut 3 can talk about.

894
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:39,059
我有个主意可以让你振作起来
I have an idea of what might cheer you up.

895
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,891


896
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,726
因为没有字母
So because no letter

897
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,834
可以自身编码，已经有少数
can be encoded as itself,there's already a handful

898
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,164
设定打一开始就被拒绝
of settings that can be rejected at the outset.

899
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,508
那是你的团队？
Is that your team?

900
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,339
- 是的      -我们要打招呼吗？
- Y-Yes.    - Shall we say hello?

901
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,912
- 不要         - 嗨
- No.          - Hello.

902
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,911
我说过不要打招呼
L-I told you not to do that.

903
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,679
- 艾伦         -呃，休，嗨
- Alan.        - Uh, Hugh, h-hello.

904
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,618
-我不知道你会喝酒            - 他不喝
- Didn't know you drank.      - He doesn't, really.

905
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,349
他只是喝一点泡沫
He just sort of sips at the foam.

906
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,254
好吧，我告诉你个小秘密，小姐..
Well, I'll let you into a little secret, Miss...?

907
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:10,417
叫我克拉克
Clarke.

908
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,823
- 克拉克小姐            -请讲
- Miss Clarke.          - Please.

909
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,760
泡沫也是我最喜欢的部分
Foam's my favorite part, too.

910
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,023
这是真的吗？
Is it really?

911
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,633
来和我们一起喝一杯吧？
Come and join us for a drink?

912
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,098
我们一会儿就过来
We'll be there in a moment.

913
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,328
克拉克小姐
Miss Clarke.

914
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,033


915
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,041
嗯，他喜欢你
Well, he likes you.

916
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,975
-是的        -你…
- Yes.       -You...

917
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,776
故意让他喜欢你
g-got him to like you.

918
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,281
是的
Yes.

919
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,715
为什么？
Why?

920
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,786
因为我做的是男人们的工作
Because I'm a woman in a man's job,

921
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,356
而且我有没有可以引以为傲的本事
and I don't have the luxury of being an ass.

922
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,458
艾伦…
Alan...

923
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,788
不管你有多聪明
it doesn't matter how smart you are,

924
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,896
英格玛永远比你聪明
Enigma is always smarter.

925
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,554
如果你真的
If you really

926
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,030
要解决你的难题
want to solve your puzzle,

927
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,169
那么你要利用你可以得到的
then you're going to need all the help

928
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,361
所有帮助，他们是不会
you can get,and they are not going

929
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,974
来帮助你，如果他们不喜欢你的话
to help you if they do not like you.

930
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,133


931
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,845
-那是什么？             -苹果
- What are those?       - Apples.

932
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,214
-不会吧           -哦，还真是
- No.             - Oh, they really are.

933
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:14,325
呃，我..嗯，克拉克小姐，我叫她琼，嗯…
Um, l... well, Miss Clarke,Joan actually, um...

934
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,324
她说这样会
said that it would be...

935
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,986
很不错，额，如果我给你们带些东西的话
Nice if I was to, uh,bring you all something.

936
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,597
所以我就这么做了，我...
So here we are. I...

937
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,857
谢谢
Thank you.

938
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,693
我喜欢苹果
I like apples.

939
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,700
替我向克拉克小姐问好
My best to Miss Clarke.

940
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,838
额，树林中的两个人
Uh, there are two people in a wood,

941
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,031
呃，他们碰到一只熊
and, um, they run into a bear.

942
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,574
第一个人跪下祈祷
The first person gets down on his knees to pray.

943
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,541
第二个人开始绑紧他的鞋带
The second person starts lacing up his boots.

944
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,339
第一个人问第二个人
The first person asks the second person,

945
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,039
“我亲爱的朋友，你在做什么？
"My dear friend,what are you doing?

946
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,740
你-你-你跑不过熊的”
You-you-you can't outrun a bear."

947
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,715
呃，第二个人说
Uh, to which the second person responds,

948
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,047
“我不需要跑过熊
"I don't have to.

949
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,246
我只需跑过你就行”
I only have to outrun you."

950
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,736
我会在克里斯托弗那，如果有人需要我的话
I'll be w-with Christopher, if anyone needs me.

951
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,838
如果我们假设2的平方根
If we assume that the square root of two

952
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,236
是个有理数，那么可以说
is a rational number,then we can say

953
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,537
2的平方根
that the square root of two

954
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,043
是A/B
is A over B...

955
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,376
其中A和B
where A and B

956
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,986
是整数，B不能为零
are whole numbers and B is not zero.

957
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,144
图灵先生，你在传纸条吗？
Mr. Turing,passing notes, are we?

958
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,881
没有，先生
No, sir.

959
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:29,332
只有图灵会传写着胡言乱语的纸条
Only Turing would pass notes written in gibberish.

960
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,968


961
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:35,901
好了，先生们
All right, gentlemen,

962
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,565
假期别忘了你们的代数
do not forget your algebra over the break.

963
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,303
假期愉快，当你们回来的
Have a pleasant holiday,and we'll resume

964
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,643
时候我们开始讲无理数
your irrationals when you return.

965
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,944


966
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,495


967
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,994


968
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,615
嗯
Mm.

969
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,443


970
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,144
用欧拉定理就可以直接算出答案
But Euler's Theorem gives you that immediately.

971
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,516
嗯...
Um...

972
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,986


973
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,387


974
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,289


975
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,197
给你，你看下这个
Here. Look at this.

976
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,437
如果你运行的电线穿过插板矩阵的对角
If you run the wires across the plugboard matrix diagonally,

977
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,540
这将使转子位置的消除速度达到500倍
it will eliminate rotor positions 500 times faster.

978
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,870
这个，呃...
That's, uh...

979
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,536
其实不完全是一个糟糕的主意
actually not an entirely terrible idea.

980
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,844
我想艾伦是在说“谢谢”
I think that was Alan for "thank you."

981
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:59,189
呃，那是我的三明治
Uh, th-that's my sandwich.

982
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,586
你不喜欢三明治
You don't like sandwiches.

983
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,851


984
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,932
你紧张吗？
You nervous?

985
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,172


986
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,580


987
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,449


988
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,199
现在它在干嘛？
What happens now?

989
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:46,064
它应该能算出英格玛的设定
It-it should work out the day's Enigma settings.

990
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,870


991
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,739


992
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,142
需要多久？
How long?

993
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,723


994
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,997
胜利万岁！胜利万岁！
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

995
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,969
德国军队已经遍布欧洲
The German Army has fanned out across Europe,

996
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,837
从波兰到塞尔维亚，立陶宛到丹麦
from Poland to Serbia,Lithuania to Denmark,

997
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,273
挪威到法国
Norway to France.

998
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,277
纳粹国旗已插在二十多个
The Nazi flag now flies from more than two dozen

999
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,006
国家的首都
national capitals.

1000
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,911
他们来势凶猛
Their campaign mounts in fury

1001
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,813
想使自由的欧洲崩溃
as a free Europe crumbles.

1002
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,149


1003
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,849


1004
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,130


1005
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,839


1006
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,818
哦，它还在运行中
Oh, it's still going.

1007
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,725
- 早上好，先生          -早上好，玛格丽特
- Good morning, sir.    - Morning, Margaret.

1008
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,730
齿轮一直转
Gears keep spinning on and on.

1009
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,664
转子也一直在动
Rotors on and on.

1010
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,394
没有停过
It's endless.

1011
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,301
还不能看出什么结果吗？
With no result in sight?

1012
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:30,872
不能
No.

1013
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:36,238
哇
Ow.

1014
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,110


1015
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,045


1016
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,588
图灵
Turing.

1017
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:53,088


1018
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,096
图灵
Turing,

1019
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,532
-打开这该死的门                  - 哦，不
- open the bloody door.          - Uh, no.

1020
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,172
不开
No.

1021
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,439
开门不然我们就强行进入了
Open the door or we'll break it down.

1022
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,239
我不能让你进来！我. ..我不能让你干涉
I can't let you in! I-l...I cannot let you interfere.

1023
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,778
踹开它
Go on, then.

1024
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,578
把那东西关掉
Turn that thing off.

1025
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,419
不，不要，求你了，别这样
No. Don't, please. Please.

1026
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,220
不要！求求你！
Please! Please!

1027
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,384
不！
No!

1028
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:26,552
别，别关！
N-No. No!

1029
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,391
不要!
Don't!

1030
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,125


1031
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,736
嗯，那么，看来你伟大的大型
Well, then, it seems that your great big

1032
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,202
贵重机器没什么用处啊
expensive machine doesn't work.

1033
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,568


1034
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,106
有用
It does.

1035
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,471
很好
Wonderful.

1036
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,703
也就是说你破解了英格玛了？
So you've broken Enigma, then?

1037
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,440
只是...
It was just...

1038
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,812
还在运算中
s-still working.

1039
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,215
这是我在内政部的同事
This is my associate from the Home Office.

1040
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,014
你知道，十万英镑
You see, a hundred thousand pounds

1041
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,917
可不是什么小钱
is rather a lot of money,

1042
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:57,083
他过来看是想知道有什么结果
and he's here to see what you have to show for it.

1043
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,492
你…永远都不会懂
You... will never understand

1044
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:04,965
我在这所做的事情的重要性！
the importance of what I-l am creating here!

1045
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,332
你有解密德国的任何消息吗？
Have you decrypted any German messages?

1046
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,133
哪怕一条也行？
A single one?

1047
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,938
你能说说你完成了什么吗？
Can you point to anything at all that you've achieved?

1048
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:18,343
嗯，你的资金用完了
Hmm. Your funding is up,

1049
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,813
我们的耐心是有限度的
and our patience is expired.

1050
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,577
真是开心
It's with such great pleasure

1051
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,017
能说出这句话
that I am finally able to say this.

1052
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:28,591
艾伦图灵，你被解雇了
Alan Turing,you're fired.

1053
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,662
请送图灵先生离开这里
Please escort Mr. Turing from the premises.

1054
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,765
不可以
No.

1055
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,197
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

1056
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,942
如果你解雇艾伦…
If you fire Alan...

1057
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,203
那，把我也解雇了吧
well, then you'll have to fire me, too.

1058
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,040
你知道你在说什么吗？
What on earth are you saying?

1059
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:52,649
相信我没有人比我跟
Trust me when I tell you there is no one

1060
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:56,116
不想承认我所说的，但是…
who would rather say this less than I do, but...

1061
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,777
他是对的
he's right.

1062
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,014
艾伦是对的
Alan is right.

1063
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,318
他的机器可以运作，它可能是
His machine can work,and it's probably

1064
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,392
我们所拥有的最好的机会
the best chance that we've got.

1065
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,825
天啊，真是难以置信
God, it's beyond belief.

1066
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:09,056
如果你解雇他们…
If you fire them...

1067
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:11,634
那你也得解雇我
you'll have to fire me, too.

1068
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,531
还有我
And me.

1069
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,867
我们是英国最好的解密学家
We're the best cryptographic minds in Britain.

1070
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,008
你要解雇我们所有人吗？
Are you going to fire us all?

1071
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,577
指挥官，至少给我们一些时间
Commander, at least give us some more time

1072
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,237
六个月，如果机器不产生
Six months, and if the machine doesn't produce

1073
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,143
任何我们需要的结果，然后我们就重新
any results that we need,then we'll go back

1074
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,546
使用以前的方法……怎么样？
to doing things the old way...how about that?

1075
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,387
一个月
One month.

1076
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,995
如果你们都走的话
And then,so help me God,

1077
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,028
那可不得了
you're all gone.

1078
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,893
哦，放开他
Oh, leave him.

1079
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,029


1080
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,104


1081
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:52,436
谢谢你
Thank you.

1082
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,940
不用客气
You're welcome.

1083
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,344
哦，艾伦，你的机器...
Oh, and, Alan,your machine...

1084
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,346
...最好该死的有用
...it better bloody work.

1085
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,181


1086
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,950


1087
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,084
休
Hugh.

1088
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,453
我发誓…
I swear...

1089
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,633
我不是间谍
I'm not a spy.

1090
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,430
哦，天啊，你当然不是一个该死的间谍
Oh, for God's sake, of course you're not a bloody spy.

1091
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,766
什么？
What?

1092
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,305
丹尼斯顿给我比尔密码
Denniston gave me the Beale cipher,

1093
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,635
你猜怎么着？
and guess what?

1094
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:26,970
我破解了它
I cracked it.

1095
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:29,374
“求，就会给予汝
"Ask, and it shall be given to you;

1096
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,947
寻，就能寻见”马太福音第七章第七段
seek and ye shall find." Matthew 7:7.

1097
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,413
这就是关键所在
That was the key.

1098
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,485
对像你这样的人来说太简单了
Far too simple for the likes of you.

1099
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,551
可怜的丹尼斯顿不同意
Pity Denniston disagrees.

1100
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,590


1101
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,134
进来
Come in.

1102
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,831
先生，我觉得我发现图灵的证据了
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

1103
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,407
我昨晚跟踪他
I tailed him

1104
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,874
到一个酒吧，在那里他遇到了一个家伙
to a pub last night,where he met a bloke.

1105
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,069
他们交换了一个信封
They exchanged an envelope.

1106
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,839
所以我跟着这个家伙
So I follow this other fella,

1107
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,642
抓了他，好好的审问了下
pick him up,give him a good shake.

1108
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,616
他说他是一个同性恋，他招了一切，
He's a poofter.He confessed.

1109
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,118
什么？
What?

1110
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,519
他说他叫阿诺德莫里
The man admitted it.Arnold Murray.

1111
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,422
在酒吧附近闲逛，等男人买他一夜春宵
Hangs around that pub;men pay him for a go.

1112
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,289
图灵就是其中一个
Turing's one of the men that paid.

1113
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:20,624
这个莫里先生
Only Mr. Murray here

1114
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,492
在事后和他的朋友
then has the bright idea

1115
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,465
想到一个聪明的主意一同去打劫图灵的房子
of robbing Turing's house after, with a friend.

1116
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,125
这就是图灵所隐藏的秘密
That's what Turing's hiding.

1117
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,466
好吧，他是个同性恋，不是间谍
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

1118
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,868
- 不    -怎么了？
- No.   - What's the matter?

1119
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,600
我们可以控告一个大学教授
We can charge a university professor

1120
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,142
- 猥亵             - 不，这简直..
- with indecency.   - No, this is...

1121
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,676
没有任何意义
it's bloody rubbish.

1122
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:36,836
图灵企图做一些更重要的事情…
Turing's up to something important...

1123
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,278
他犯了罪，并且做了违法的事
He's committed a crime and he's broken the law.

1124
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,178
和男人上床，天啊
And with a bloke.Jesus Christ,

1125
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,944
- 这真让人恶心              -这不是
- it's bloody disgusting.   - This isn't

1126
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,610
我正在进行调查的事情
the investigation I was conducting.

1127
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:46,882
把他带来
Bring him in.

1128
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,991
等下
Wait.

1129
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,149
让我来审问他
L-Let me interrogate him.

1130
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,455
给我单独半个小时就行
Please. Give me half an hour alone,

1131
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,461
我发誓，下个月
and then I swear,I'll spend the next month

1132
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,861
你给我的任何烂案子我都接
running errands on as many rubbish cases as you like.

1133
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,833
好吧，现在，谁给我弄个抓
Fine. Now,will someone get me a warrant

1134
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,028
艾伦 图灵逮捕令
for the arrest of Alan Turing.

1135
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,974


1136
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,883
艾伦？
Alan?

1137
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,049
克里斯托弗实在太慢了
Christopher's simply not moving fast enough.

1138
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,059
- 我们应该谈谈      -即使有捷径
- We should talk.   - And even with the diagonal board,

1139
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,754
他还是不能快速消除设定
he's still not eliminating settings as quickly

1140
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,660
- 我们需要他让...                 - 我要走了
- as we need him to in order...   - I'm leaving.

1141
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,494
但你才刚来
But you've just walked in.

1142
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:32,760
不
No.

1143
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,700
不是的，是离开布莱奇利
No. Bletchley.

1144
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:35,929
怎么了？
What?

1145
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,369
是我的父母
It's my parents.

1146
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,839
我25岁，未婚，独自生活
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,I'm living alone,

1147
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,239
他们想让我回家
and they want me home.

1148
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,402
这太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

1149
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,173
这就是我的父母
That's my parents.

1150
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,841
你... 你不能离开...我不会让你走的
You... you can't leave...l-l won't let you.

1151
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,886
“我会想你的”这是一个平常人
"I'll miss you." That's what a normal person

1152
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,683
- 在这种情况下都会说的话         - 我不关心平常不平常
- might say in this situation.   - I-l don't care what is normal.

1153
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,088
我该做
What am I supposed

1154
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,251
些什么，艾伦？
to do, Alan?

1155
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,988
我..我是不会...
L-I will not...

1156
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,688
抛弃我的父母的
give up my parents.


1157
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,134
你...你在这里有机会
You... you have an opportunity here

1158
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,135
去实现你的自身价值
to make some actual use of your life.

1159
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,933
然后你一样的下场？不，谢谢
And end up like you?No, thanks.

1160
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,236
我为你的孤独感到难过
I'm sorry you're lonely.

1161
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,573
英格玛也救不了你
But Enigma will not save you.

1162
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,306
你能破解它吗？你个脆弱的自恋狂
Can you decipher that,you fragile narcissist?

1163
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:20,507
还是你想让我去找你的
Or would you like me to go and fetch

1164
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,207
宝贝克里斯托弗来帮忙？
your precious Christopher to help?

1165
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,152


1166
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:29,554
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1167
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,660
嗯..
Mm...

1168
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,820


1169
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,661
我想你…我想你留下来因为我喜欢你
I want you... I want you to stay because I-l like you.

1170
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,101
我喜欢和你…说话
I like...talking to you.

1171
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,605
我也喜欢和你说话，艾伦
I like talking to you,too, Alan.

1172
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,314
如果你不再是一个人？
And what if you weren't alone?

1173
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,417
如果你有一个丈夫呢？
What if you had a husband?

1174
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,950


1175
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,088
你有理想的人选吗？
Do you have one in mind?

1176
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:00,621
我有
I do.

1177
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,417
休？
Hugh? 

1178
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,526
休很有魅力，我承认
Hugh's terribly attractive,I'll give you that,

1179
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,822
但他不是我想结婚的那种
but I don't really think he's the marrying kind.

1180
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,989
不，我没有在想休
No, I-l wasn't thinking of Hugh.

1181
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,692
那就是彼得
Or Peter.

1182
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,962
彼得太安静了
Peter's so quiet.

1183
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,341
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1184
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,807
但是这是合乎情理的
But this makes sense.

1185
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,446
你是在向我求婚吗？
Did you just propose to me?

1186
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,241
嗯，这是顺理成章的事
Well, it is the logical thing to do.

1187
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,713
- 这太荒谬了                 - 这是你的父母想要的
- This is ridiculous.        - This is your parents.

1188
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,344
我-我不信..居然就这么发生了
I-I can't... believe that this is happening.

1189
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,386
呃，琼…
Mm. Joan...

1190
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,891


1191
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,393
你的中间名是卡洛琳还是凯瑟琳？
Is your middle name Caroline or Catherine?

1192
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:43,556
-伊丽莎白            -嗯，琼 伊丽莎白…
- Elizabeth.         - Um, Joan Elizabeth...

1193
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,531
克拉克，嗯…
Clarke, um...

1194
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,672
...你愿意嫁给我吗？
...will you marry me?

1195
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:54,741


1196
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,980
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

1197
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,145
嗯，我知道这不常见，不过…
Well, I know it isn't ordinary, but...

1198
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,155
喜欢常见的呢？
whoever loved ordinary?

1199
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,315
她把它捧在手上...
She had it in both hands...

1200
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,482


1201
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,459
然后她抬头看着我说，
And she looked up at me with her doe eyes and said,

1202
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,654
“我应该把它放进我的嘴里吗？”
"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"

1203
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:19,564
我说，“是的，你知道的，像法国人那样”
And I said, "Yes.You know, the French way."

1204
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,431
然后她把它放进嘴里
So she pops it in,

1205
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,266
把它含住
clamps her lips around it,

1206
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,375
并开始哼唱那该死的马赛曲
and starts humming the bloody Marseillaise.

1207
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,011


1208
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,408
我们跳舞吧
Come have a dance.

1209
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,571
不，不，不，你可以在任何时间
No, no,no, you can dance

1210
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,739
和你的未婚夫跳舞
with your fiance anytime you like.

1211
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,214
现在，这一刻…
Right now, this moment...

1212
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:37,114
轮到我了
my turn.

1213
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,688


1214
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,153


1215
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,770


1216
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,431


1217
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,541
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1218
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,919
要是...
Wh-What if...

1219
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,927
要是我不喜欢...
Wh-What if I don't fancy being...

1220
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,363
和琼那样怎么办？
with Joan I-in that way?

1221
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,800
因为你是同性恋？
Because you're a homosexual?

1222
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:35,973
我怀疑过
I suspected.

1223
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,443
嗯，我该不该告诉她
Well, should-should I tell her

1224
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,139
我和
that I've had...

1225
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,080
男人发生过关系？
affairs with men?

1226
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,083
你知道，以我...
You know, in my...

1227
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:46,086
有限的经验看来
admittedly limited experience,

1228
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,520
女人…往往是有点敏感关于
women... tend to be a bit touchy

1229
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,684
不小心嫁给同性恋
about accidentally marrying homosexuals.

1230
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:54,023
也许不要把这个消息传开
Perhaps not spreading this information about might be

1231
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,460
对你来说最好
in your best interest.

1232
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:57,862


1233
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,024
我在乎她
I care for her,

1234
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:01,193
真的，我...
I truly do. I...

1235
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,333
我..我只是不知道
I-I... I just don't know

1236
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,774
我是否可以，呃，继续装下去
if I can, um... pretend.

1237
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,381
你不能告诉任何人，艾伦
You can't tell anyone, Alan.

1238
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,643
这是违法的
It's illegal.

1239
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:17,515
丹尼斯顿可以找任何借口
And Denniston is looking for any excuse he can

1240
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,052
把你带走
to put you away.

1241
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,519
我知道
I know.

1242
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,283
保守这个秘密
This has to stay a secret.

1243
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,484
来吧，轮到你了
Come on, it's your turn.

1244
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,459
啊，好的
Ah. Okay.

1245
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,530


1246
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,679


1247
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,978


1248
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,551


1249
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,759


1250
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,511


1251
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,952


1252
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,730


1253
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,709
要茶吗？
Cup of tea?

1254
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,746
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

1255
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,820


1256
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,723
图灵先生，我可以告诉你一个秘密吗？
Mr. Turing, can I tell you a secret?

1257
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,456
秘密我很在行
I'm quite good with those.

1258
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,623
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

1259
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,798
哦，显而易见
Oh, clearly.

1260
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,997


1261
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,645
机器能思考吗？
Can machines think?

1262
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,909
哦，所以你看过我的作品咯？
Oh, so you've read some of my published works?

1263
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,110
你为什么这么说？
What makes you say that?

1264
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,812
嗯，因为我坐在警察局，
Well, because I'm sitting in a police station,

1265
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,118
被指控要求一个年轻男子摸我的阴茎
accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis

1266
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:39,785
而你只是问我机器能思考吗？
and you just asked me if machines can think.

1267
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,957
那么，它们能吗？
Well, can they?

1268
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:48,199
机器能像人类一样思考吗？
Could machines ever think as human beings do?

1269
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,804
大多数人说不能
Most people say not.

1270
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,341
你不是大多数人
You're not most people.

1271
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,779
嗯，问题在于你...问了个傻问题
Well, the problem is you're...asking a stupid question.

1272
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:00,679
是吗？
I am?

1273
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,648
机器当然...
Of course machines...

1274
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,221
不能像人类一样思考
can't think as people do.

1275
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,053
机器和人是不同的
A machine is different...from a person.

1276
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,622
因此，他们思考的方式也不同
Hence, they think differently.

1277
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:20,328
有趣的是，仅仅因为某些，嗯
The interesting question is,just because something, uh,

1278
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,902
思考方式与你不同
thinks differently from you,

1279
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,836
是不是就意味着他们没有思考能力？
does that mean it's not thinking?

1280
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,511
嗯，我们人类之间就有
Well, we allow for humans to have such divergences

1281
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:31,147
这样的不同
from one another.

1282
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,580
你喜欢吃草莓，我恨滑冰
You like strawberries,I hate ice-skating,

1283
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:39,415
你...会为悲伤的电影哭泣
you... cry at sad films,

1284
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:43,321
我..我对花粉过敏
I... am allergic to pollen.

1285
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,019
不同口味的不同点是什么
What is the point of-of different tastes,

1286
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,493
不同的…偏好的不同点又是什么
different... preferences

1287
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:51,498
如果不是说我们的大脑工作方式不同
if not to say that our brains work differently,

1288
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:54,194
我们怎会想的不一样呢？
that we think differently?

1289
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,334
如果我们可以这样认为人的思考方式
And if we can say that about one another,

1290
01:07:57,507 --> 01:08:00,204
那为什么不能这么认为由
then why can't we say the same thing for brains...

1291
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,236
铜和电缆构成的大脑也有思考能力？
built of copper and wire, steel?

1292
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,382
这就是...
And that's...

1293
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,449
你写的文章？
this big paper you wrote?

1294
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,017
名字叫什么
What's it called?

1295
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,917
“模仿游戏”
"The Imitation Game."

1296
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,079
好的，那..
Right, that's...

1297
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,247
那它是关于什么的？
that's what it's about?

1298
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,986


1299
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,359
你想玩吗？
Would you like to play?

1300
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,159
玩？
Play?

1301
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:25,562
这是一个游戏
It's a game.

1302
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,931
一种测试
A test of sorts.

1303
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,096
用于确定某物是...
For determining whether something is a...

1304
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,333
机器还是人
a machine or a human being.

1305
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,307
怎么玩？
How do I play?

1306
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,469
嗯，有一个法官和一个测试对象，呃...
Well, there's a judge and a subject, and...

1307
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,048
法官问问题
the judge asks questions,

1308
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,275
根据测试对象给出的答案
and, depending on the subject's answers,

1309
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,784
来判断法官是在和谁...
determines who he is talking with...

1310
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:49,585
或者和某物说话…
what he is talking with,and, um...

1311
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,490
你所需要做的是问我一个问题
All you have to do is ask me a question.

1312
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,628
战争期间你在做什么？
What did you do during the war?

1313
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,998
我在一个无线电工厂工作
I worked in a radio factory.

1314
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,264
在战争期间你真正在做的是什么？
What did you really do during the war?

1315
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,274


1316
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,741
你有注意听我说话吗？
Are you paying attention?

1317
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,783


1318
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:31,366


1319
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,593
该死的！
Damn it!

1320
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,605


1321
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,974
我们快没时间了，就一个月
We're soon out of time. A month.

1322
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,047
所以就这样了，是吗？
So that's it, then, is it?

1323
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,684
哦，问题是，不管我们如何改善它
Oh, the trouble is, it doesn't matter how much we improve it.

1324
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,444
机器还是不可能解决
The machine's never gonna be able to process

1325
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,180
159百万亿的可能性
159 million million million possibilities in time.

1326
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,484
没希望了
It's just bloody hopeless.

1327
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,990
它在搜寻，只是..
It's searching.It's just...

1328
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:01,597
不知道它在搜寻什么
It... doesn't know what it's searching for.

1329
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:03,698
如果我们知道这个消息要表达的是什么…
If we knew what the messages were going to say...

1330
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,027
如果我们知道这个消息要表达的是什么
If we knew what the messages were going to say,

1331
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,896
我们就不需要破解它
we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.

1332
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,038


1333
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,673


1334
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,864


1335
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,909
艾伦的那个朋友是谁？
Who's Alan's friend?

1336
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:16,808
休，他其实有点下流
Hugh. He's a bit of a cad, actually.

1337
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,970
很好，是我的类型
So my type, then?

1338
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,049
- 好吧，我给你介绍一下              -不要
- Well, I'll introduce you.         - No.

1339
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,311
他会过来的
He'll come over.

1340
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,147
-你确定？            -确定
- Are you sure?      - Yes.

1341
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:26,881
我15分钟前对他笑了一下
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago

1342
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,148
然后就没看其他地方了
and haven't looked back since.

1343
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:30,692


1344
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,918
琼旁边的是谁？
Who's that with Joan?

1345
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,460
嗯？
Hmm?

1346
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,893
呃，海伦，她的同事
Uh, Helen. Works with her.

1347
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,555
她真漂亮
She's really pretty.

1348
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,202
她希望我过去
She wants me to come over.

1349
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,735
什么？你怎么知道？
What? H-How on earth can you know that?

1350
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,736
她对我笑了笑
She smiled at me a while back

1351
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,738
然后就没看其他地方了
and she hasn't looked again since.

1352
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,276
他上钩了
And got him.

1353
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,883
现在，这是为什么，当我是单身时
Now, why is this,that when I was single

1354
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:57,213
我发现这很无聊，但现在我订婚了
I found it very boring,but now that I'm engaged,

1355
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,854
我却觉得这很有趣
I just find it dreadfully fun.

1356
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,046


1357
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:02,953
宾戈，她上钩了
Bingo. She's in.

1358
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,890
艾伦，给我们引介一下
Alan, introduce us.

1359
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:07,086
什么？为什么是我？
What? Wh-Why me?

1360
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:10,794
因为没有什么能像一个朋友的订婚
Because there's nothing like a friend's engagement

1361
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,765
使一个女人想要和她朋友的未婚夫的帅气朋友
to make a woman want to do something she'll later regret

1362
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,926
做点她事后会后悔的事
with the fiance's better looking chum.

1363
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,469
我们过去
Let's go.

1364
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,402
半克朗赌艾伦会搞砸
Half a crown says Alan bollixes this up entirely.

1365
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,048
不赌
No bet.

1366
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,582
- 艾伦图灵有个理论                - 他有很多
- Alan Turing has a theory.       -  He has many.

1367
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,549
他认为禁止男人与女人
He believes that the regulations

1368
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,781
一起工作的规定是正确的
against men and women working side by side are sound

1369
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,822
因为这样的接近必然导致情愫
because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance.

1370
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,255
什么？不，我没有，我...
What? No,I don't. I...

1371
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,587
然而…
However...

1372
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,751
我不同意
I disagree.

1373
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,454
-是吗？        -是的
- You do?      - Yeah.

1374
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,827
我想如果我整天和一个女人一起工作
I think that if I were working beside a woman all daylong,

1375
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,662
不用和她上床
I could appreciate her abilities and intellect

1376
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:49,066
就能欣赏她的能力和智慧很好
without taking her to bed.

1377
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:51,335
对不起，我们见过吗？
I'm sorry, have we met?

1378
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:54,135
我不记得，但我觉得我们没有
I don't recall.But let's assume we haven't.

1379
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,937
海伦 斯图尔特，休 亚力山大
Helen Stewart.Hugh Alexander.

1380
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:57,170
那你赞成谁的
So who do you agree with,

1381
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,508
-艾伦还是我的？       -当然是艾伦的
- Alan or myself?     - Well, Alan, of course.

1382
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,652
我很高兴，真的，但我不认为…
L-I'm very flattered, really,but I-l don't think...

1383
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,618
-  胡说           - 我每天都和男人
-  Rubbish.        - Well, I work beside a man

1384
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,313
一起工作，我控制不住
every day,and I can't help

1385
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,015
不让自己对他产生点感觉
but have developed a bit of a crush on him.

1386
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:10,956
嗯，这个人是谁？我要揍他一顿
Well, who is this man?So I can kick his arse.

1387
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,186
好的，不用担心…只是想想而已
Well, there's no need to worry... it's been chaste.

1388
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,854
我们甚至都没见过，他是个德国人
We've never even met.He's a German.

1389
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,195
现在我真想杀了他
Now I really want to kill him.

1390
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,633
你说德国人一起工作是什么意思？
How-how do you mean you work alongside a German?

1391
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,466
嗯，我们每个人都从一个特定的
Well, each of us intercepts messages

1392
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,369
德国广播塔拦截信息
from a specific German radio tower.

1393
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:27,805
所以我们在另一边有个同行
So we have a counterpart on the other side

1394
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,342
再打这些信息
who's tip-tapping out the messages.

1395
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,276
每个人都有不同的节奏
Everyone types a touch differently,

1396
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,279
所以你会开始了解你的同行的节奏
so you get to know the rhythm of your counterpart.

1397
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,178
有种奇怪的亲密感
It's strangely intimate.

1398
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,342
我觉得我很了解他
I feel as if I know him so well.

1399
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,851
可惜他有女朋友
It's a pity he has a girlfriend,

1400
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,285
这就是为什么我不同意你的观点，亚力山大先生
but that's why I disagree  with you, Mr. Alexander.

1401
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,391
因为我爱上了一个同事
Because I'm in love with a coworker of sorts,

1402
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,049
我们甚至都没见过面
and we've never even met.

1403
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:46,855
好的，请允许我给你买一杯酒
Well, allow me to buy you another pint,

1404
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,622
然后我会告诉你为什么你错了
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.

1405
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:50,197
好的
Let's.

1406
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,697
太好了
Excellent.

1407
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,563


1408
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,203
谢谢
Thanks.

1409
01:12:56,372 --> 01:13:00,070
啤酒，你们有松子酒吗？
Um, pints.Have you got any sloe gin?

1410
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,408
以防你不知道那行为就是调情
In case you were wondering,that's what flirting looks like.

1411
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,049
海伦…
Helen...

1412
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,150
-真的没有香烟吗？            -艾伦…
- Really, no cigarettes?      - Alan...

1413
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,513
怎么了艾伦？
Yes, Alan?

1414
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,085
为什么你认为
Wh-Why do you think

1415
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,622
你的德国同行有一个女朋友？
your German counterpart has a girlfriend?

1416
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:17,725
-只是一个愚蠢的笑话；别在意               - 不，不，不，不行，告诉我
- It's just a stupid joke; don't worry.   - No, no, no, no. Tell me.

1417
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:20,054
嗯，他的每一个信息
Well, each of his messages

1418
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,526
都用相同的五个字母开头：
begins with the same five letters:

1419
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,529
C-I-L-L-Y
C-I-L-L-Y.

1420
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,394
所以我猜想希里可能就是他
So I suspect that Cilly must be the name

1421
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,058
- 女友的名字       -但那是不可能的
- of his amore.    - But that's impossible.

1422
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,261
德国人指示使用五个随机字母
The Germans are instructed to use five random letters

1423
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,530
为每一个信息的开头
at the start of every message.

1424
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,071
好吧，这小子不是
Well, this bloke doesn't.

1425
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,506
我认为爱情会使人做奇怪的事
Love will make a man do strange things, I suppose.

1426
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:39,012
那在这种情况下，德国将输给爱情一场战争
In this case, love just lost Germany the whole bloody war.

1427
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,376
哦1
Oh!

1428
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,675
走，彼得
Go, Peter.

1429
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,750
不好意思
Sorry.

1430
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:50,181
艾伦！艾伦1

如果
What...

1439
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,937
如果克里斯托弗
what if...what if Christopher

1440
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,311
不用搜寻所有的设定
doesn't have to search through all of the settings?

1441
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,248
如果他只需要检查几个词
What if he only has to search through

1442
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:20,219
在情报里我们已经知道的
ones that produce words we already know will be

1443
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,586
- 是什么？             -重复可以预见的词
- in the message?      - Repeated words; predictable words.

1444
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:23,748
没错
Exactly.

1445
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,452


1446
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,755
看，看，比如这个
Look, look, like this one.

1447
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,762
“0600小时，今天白天天气晴朗

1448
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,764
“晚上有雨，希特勒万岁”
Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

1449
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,561


1450
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:35,467
这就是了
Well, that's it.

1451
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,128
没错
Exactly.

1452
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,173
他们每天六点发一份天气预报
They send a weather report every day at 6:00 a.m.

1453
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:43,608
所以我-我们已经知道
So that's-that's three words we know will be

1454
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,476
在每天六点的情报中有“天气”这个词，绝对的
in every 6:00 a.m. message..."weather," obviously,

1455
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,640

- a-and...        - Heil bloody Hitler.

1456
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,650

01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:36,430
让潜艇...
Let the U-boats...

1560
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,663
-打沉护航                  - 听着，我们知道
- sink the convoy.         - Look, it's been

1561
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:38,897
你工作了很久 ...也许你...
a big day...maybe you're...

1562
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:42,510
-我们没有时间...               - 不！
- We don't have time...        - No!

1563
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:44,237
哦!休！休！可以了！
Oh! Hugh! Hugh!That's enough!

1564
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:45,676
- 你够了！              - 住手，休！
- That's enough!        - Stop, Hugh!

1565
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:47,145
约翰，这个突袭在分秒之间
John, the attack is in minutes.

1566
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:48,545


1567
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,448
不用，我没事，我很好
Yes, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1568
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,111
我没事
I'm fine.

1569
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:57,021
你知道为什么人们喜欢暴力吗？休
You know why people like violence, Hugh?

1570
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,957
因为它使人感觉很好
It's because it feels good.

1571
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,588
有时我们不能做什么的感觉很好的事
Sometimes we can't do what feels good.

1572
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,427
我们要做的是理智的事
We have to do what is logical.

1573
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:07,261
什么理智的事？
What's logical?

1574
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:08,835
最难的欺骗是
Hardest time to lie to somebody

1575
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,836
当他们有防备被骗的时候
is when they're expecting to be lied to.

1576
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,440
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

1577
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:13,905
怎么了？
What?

1578
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,339
当有人正在等待着一个谎言时
If someone's waiting for a lie,

1579
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,001
你不能，呃，给他们一个
you can't just,uh, give them one.

1580
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,647


1581
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,304
该死的，艾伦是对的
Damn it, Alan's right.

1582
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,280
什么？
What?

1583
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:24,943
如果我们摧毁了他们的潜艇
What would the Germans think if we destroy

1584
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,679
德军会怎么想？
their U-boats?

1585
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,448
还能怎么想，他们都死了
Nothing. They'll be dead.

1586
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:29,955
不
No.

1587
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,957
不，你不可能是对的
No, you can't be right.

1588
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,117
我们的护航队伍
So our convoy

1589
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,855
突然偏离路线…
suddenly veers off course...

1590
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,125
一群空军轰炸机
a squadron of our air bombers

1591
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,861
奇迹般地降落在德国潜艇的坐标上…
miraculously descends on the coordinates of the U-boats...

1592
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,837
德军会怎么想？
what will the Germans think?

1593
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,936
德军会知道
The Germans will know

1594
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:51,205
我们破解了英格玛
that we have broken Enigma.

1595
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:55,339
他们会在中午停止一切无线电通信
They'll stop all radio communications by midday,

1596
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,042
在这个周末改变英格玛的
and they'll have changed the design of Enigma

1597
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:00,154
- 设定                       - 没错
- by the weekend.            -  Yes.

1598
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,222
两年的工作
Two years' work.

1599
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,519
我们所做的这一切
Everything that we've done here

1600
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,752
都将白费
will all be for nothing.

1601
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:09,057
在那艘护航上有五百个普通百姓
There are 500 civilians in that convoy.

1602
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,392
女人...
Women...

1603
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:13,058
孩子
children.

1604
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,363
我们是在送他们去死
We're about to let them die.

1605
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,005
我们的工作不是
Our job I-is

1606
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,800

去就一艘护航船，而是去赢得
not to save one passenger convoy, it is to win

1607
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,411
-战争               - 我们的工作是破解英格玛
- the war.          - Our job was to crack Enigma.

1608
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:25,445
我们做到了了
We've done that.

1609
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,741
现在是最困难的部分
Now for the hard part.

1610
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,515
- 保守秘密              -卡莱尔
- Keeping it a secret.  - Carlisle.

1611
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:34,247
什么？
What?

1612
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:36,551
这个你说的护航船...它，呃
The convoy you're about to...it's, uh...

1613
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,751
是皇家公务船中的其中一艘，叫卡莱尔
The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.

1614
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,627
我们不会对每一份情报都做出回应
We can't act on every piece of intelligence.

1615
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:45,665
好吧，我们不会
So fine, we won't.

1616
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,496
但这一份
Just this one.

1617
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,331
彼得，你怎么了？
Peter, what's the matter with you?

1618
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,975
我的哥哥..
My-my brother's...

1619
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:55,509
那个，他在卡莱尔上
well, he's on the Carlisle.

1620
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,840
他是海军射击少尉
A gunnery ensign.

1621
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,111
我很..
I'm...

1622
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,551
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1623
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,452
你觉得你自己是什么人？
Who the hell do you think you are?

1624
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,596
那...那是我的哥哥
This... this is my brother.

1625
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,061


1626
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:18,757
他是我的大哥，没事，你还有
He's my big brother,all right, and you have

1627
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,265
几分钟的时间可以救他
a few minutes to call off his murder.

1628
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,370
我们不能
We can't.

1629
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:23,562


1630
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,242
他是对的
He's right.

1631
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,309
艾伦
Alan.

1632
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:32,743
琼
Joan.

1633
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,383
休
Hugh.

1634
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,882
约翰
John.

1635
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:39,420
求你们了，我...
Please, I...

1636
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,113
德军他们不会因为
The-the Germans, they won't get suspicious

1637
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,917
这一起袭击起疑心的
just because we stop one attack.

1638
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,355
没有人会知道的
No one will know.

1639
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,359
我求你们了...
I'm asking you...

1640
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,793
以你们朋友的身份
as your friend.

1641
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,490
救救他吧
Please.

1642
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,470
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1643
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,505
你不是上帝，艾伦...你没有权利决定
You're not God, Alan...you don't get to decide

1644
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:01,666
谁生谁死
who lives and who dies.

1645
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,176
不，我们可以
Yes, we do.

1646
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:08,042
为什么？
Why?

1647
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,686
因为再也没有其他人可以
Because no one else can.

1648
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:15,017


1649
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,697


1650
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,041


1651
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,310


1652
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,228
你为什么告诉我这个？
Why are you telling me this?

1653
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:04,134
我们需要你帮忙通过英国海军、空军、陆军
We need your help to keep this a secret from...

1654
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:08,073
来隐藏这个秘密
Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1655
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,508
呃，谁也不能知道我们破解了英格玛
Uh, no one can know we broke Enigma.

1656
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,580
即使是丹尼斯顿也不能
Not even Denniston.

1657
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:16,343
他正在考虑解雇你
Who's in the process of having you fired.

1658
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,316
你可以处理好那个
You can take care of that.

1659
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:21,047
虽然我们开发了一个系统来帮助你确定
While we develop a system to help you determine

1660
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:22,748
哪些情报中的
how much intelligence

1661
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:25,360
袭击...去阻止它发生
to act on... which a-attacks to stop,

1662
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,517
哪些需要放弃
which to let through.

1663
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:29,096
完全的统计分析
Statistical analysis.

1664
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,891
希望用最少的攻击
The minimal number of actions

1665
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,558
来赢得战争
it would take for us to win the war...

1666
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,102
在德军起疑心之前
but the maximum number we can take

1667
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:38,603
做出最多的攻击
before the Germans get suspicious.

1668
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:42,870
所以你要相信这些数据统计是吗？
And you're going to trust all this to statistics?

1669
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:45,480
- 对数学？           - 对的
- To maths?          - Correct.

1670
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,581
然后军情六处要想出一个谎言
And then MI6 can come up with the lies

1671
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,217
来告诉其他人
that we tell everybody else.

1672
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,718
你需要一个可靠的情报来源
You'll need a believable alternative source for all

1673
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:54,378
使它可以用在所有的情报上
the pieces of information you use.

1674
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,389
一个我们能够解释我们的如何得到信息的虚假的故事
A false story so that we can explain how we got our information

1675
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,186
而不是通过英格玛
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

1676
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:02,456
然后你可以把这些故事泄漏给，额，德军
And then you can leak those stories to the, uh, the Germans.

1677
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:04,599
然后是我们自己的军队
And then to our own military.

1678
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,899
对最高级别的政府
Maintain a conspiracy of lies

1679
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:14,543
散布一个阴谋谎言
at the highest levels of government.

1680
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,284
听起来很对我胃口
Sounds right up my alley.

1681
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:31,289
艾伦，我很少会这样说
Alan, I so rarely have cause to say this,

1682
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,419
你正是我一直希望的那个人
but you are exactly the man I always hoped you would be.

1683
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,569


1684
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:52,246
他们代号命名为“最强者”
They code-named it "Ultra."

1685
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:55,281
它为英国收集了最多的军事情报
It became the largest store of military intelligence

1686
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,420
在，呃……世界历史上
in, uh...the history of the world.

1687
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,520


1688
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,318


1689
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:09,431
就像在海因里希 希姆莱的对讲机里装了窃听器
It was like having a tap on Himmler's intercom.

1690
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,623
I-E-O...
I-E-O...

1691
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,268


1692
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,733
保密成为首要关注的问题
Secrecy became the primary concern,

1693
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:19,498
因为某些原因，他们……他们信任我
and for some reason, they...they trusted me.

1694
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:23,176
彼得…你有，呃
Peter... do you have the, uh,

1695
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,313
那个630电译文...
the-the 630 decryp...

1696
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,688


1697
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,750


1698
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,683
……是比尔密码
...it's a Beale cipher

1699
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,481
加密来自一本书中的一句短语或…
encrypted with a phrase from a book or...

1700
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,852
“求，就会给予汝
"Ask,and it will be given to you;

1701
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,153
寻，就能寻见”马太福音第七章第七段
seek and you will find."Matthew 7:7.

1702
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:14,489
这就是关键所在
That was the key.

1703
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:17,223
彼得总有一天会回心转意的
Peter will come around eventually.

1704
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,270
杰克
Jack.

1705
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:31,106
能让我和艾伦单独呆会儿吗？
Could you give Alan and me a moment, please?

1706
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,441


1707
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:41,113


1708
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,620
苏联和美国
The Soviets and us,

1709
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,725
是我们站在同一边
we're on the same side.

1710
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:47,726
我所做的事会帮助英国
What I'm doing will help Britain.

1711
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:50,558
我要告诉丹尼斯顿
L-I have to tell Denniston.

1712
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:53,758
不，你不会的
No, you don't.

1713
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,029
因为如果你告诉他我的秘密…
Because if you tell him my secret...

1714
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:58,468
我会告诉他你的
I'll tell him yours.

1715
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:03,644
你知道他们会对同性恋怎么做吗？
Do you know what they do to homosexuals?

1716
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:05,644
你永远不能再工作
You'll never be able to work again,

1717
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:07,680
永远不能教书
never be able to teach.

1718
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:09,817
你宝贵的机器…
Your precious machine...

1719
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:12,420
我怀疑你会再也见不到他
I doubt you'll ever see him again.

1720
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:21,493


1721
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:28,261


1722
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,427
你好，我可以...可以，额
Hello. Can I... can I, um,

1723
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,733
和斯图尔特孟席斯通话吗？这是紧急的

1724
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:35,002
请稍候
One moment, please.

1725
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,114
你好，孟席斯
Hello. Menzies.

1726
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:45,580
关于保守秘密的一些建议
Some advice about keeping secrets.

1727
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:48,246


1728
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:52,787
就是尽量不发现他们的存在
It's a lot easier if you don't know them in the first place.

1729
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:56,522
他们有在偷看我的信，窃听我的电话
Were they steaming my letters,tapping my telephone?

1730
01:28:57,966 --> 01:29:00,697
或跟踪我紧张的步伐吗？
Trailing my nervous walks?

1731
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:03,497
你知道，我..
You know, I...

1732
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,640
我从来没有发现
I never did find out.

1733
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,866
琼？
Joan?

1734
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,034


1735
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,613
琼？
Joan?

1736
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,545
这是...
What's...

1737
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:17,949
呃…
Uh...

1738
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,814
琼在哪里？
where's Joan?

1739
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:22,116
军事监狱
Military prison.

1740
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,657
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1741
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,694
一堆破译了的英格玛信息，我在床边的
Decoded Enigma intercepts.I found a pile of them

1742
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:32,391
- 桌子上发现的               - 不，不，那些是我在
- in the bedside table.      - No, no. I-l gave those to her

1743
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,831
一年前给她的当时我还在试图找出
over a year ago when I was trying to figure out

1744
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:37,165
-这之间的联系…           -我相信你
- a link between...       - I'm sure you did.

1745
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:39,137
丹尼斯顿一直在寻找一个苏联间谍
Denniston's been looking for a Soviet spy.

1746
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,799
他认为在八组内部
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1747
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,346
我知道谁是间谍
I know who the spy is.

1748
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:48,847
不是琼，是..
It's not Joan.It's...

1749
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:51,247
凯恩 克罗斯
it's Cairncross.

1750
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,683
我发现比尔密码的线索
L-I found the Beale cipher,

1751
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:55,687
就是圣经
the Bible.

1752
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,827
天啊，我希望你是一个间谍
God, I wish you'd been a spy.

1753
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,861
你会比他强多了
You'd be so much better at this than he is.

1754
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,064
你知道是他？
You knew it was him?

1755
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,623


1756
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,858
我当然知道
Of course I bloody knew.

1757
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:09,094
他来 布莱奇利之前我就知道了
I knew before he came to Bletchley.

1758
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,865
你认为我为什么把他放在这里？
Why do you think I had him placed here?

1759
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,566
但我们只有一个英格玛密码机
But we have an Enigma machine.

1760
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,233
是的，波兰情报局…
Yeah, Polish Intelligence...

1761
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,606
你安排了
You-you placed

1762
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:22,341
一个苏联特工在布莱奇利园？
a... a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?

1763
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,848
能够给斯大林透露我们想要
It's really quite useful to be able

1764
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,612
透露的信息真是太好了
to leak whatever we want to Stalin.

1765
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,620
丘吉尔太多疑了
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1766
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,884
他是不会透露一点关于
He won't share a shred of intelligence

1767
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:33,187
苏联的情报
with the Soviets.

1768
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:36,092
即使是能帮助他们对付德国的信息也不肯透露
Not even information that will help them against the Germans.

1769
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,732
这有...
There's...

1770
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,526
太多的秘密了
so much secrecy.

1771
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:44,028
凯恩克罗斯不知道我们知道，肯定的
Cairncross has no idea we know, of course.

1772
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:47,607
他不是什么聪明人
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1773
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,210
这就是为什么我需要你的帮助
Which is why I need your help.

1774
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,402
我想知道是什么泄漏给了约翰
I want to know what to leak to John,

1775
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:52,740
苏联以及英国
what to feed to the Soviets,

1776
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,780
得到了什么信息
as well as the British.

1777
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,250
我..我不是间谍
I... I'm not a spy.

1778
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,583
我..我只是一个数学家
I'm... I'm just a mathematician.

1779
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,557
我认识很多间谍，艾伦
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1780
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:08,958
你有比他们更好的秘密
You've got more secrets than the best of them.

1781
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:16,930
你…你要答应我，你会释放琼
You... you have to promise me that you will release Joan.

1783
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,937
对了，琼在市场上
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1782
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,633
她会在一小时后回来，之前我撒了谎
She's gonna be back in an hour. I lied.

1783
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:25,578
这些我带走了
I better hold on to these.

1784
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:27,181
如果有人发现了他们
If anybody finds out about them,

1785
01:31:27,349 --> 01:31:30,114
她可能真的要进监狱了
prison will be the least of her worries.

1786
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,178
哦，艾伦…
Oh,Alan...

1787
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:37,587
我们将会合作得很愉快
we're gonna have such a wonderful war together.

1788
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:45,966


1789
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:48,000


1790
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,137


1791
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,639
我要你离开这里
I need you to leave Bletchley.

1792
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:01,441
-什么？      - 孟席斯，我不信任他
- What?     - It's Menzies. I don't trust him.

1793
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:04,950
-这里不安全                 你认为还有哪里
-It's not safe here.        - Do you think it's any safer

1794
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,451
- 比这更安全？        - 你需要离开
- anywhere else?       - You need to get away.

1795
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,146
你需要远离我
You need to get very far away from me.

1796
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,485
艾伦，发生什么事了？
Alan, what's happened?

1797
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,395
我们不能订婚了
We can't be engaged anymore.

1798
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:17,622
你…你的父母要你回去
You... your parents need to take you back

1799
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:20,063
你会在那里找到你的丈夫的
and find you a husband elsewhere.

1800
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,160
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

1801
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:27,840
我有一件事，呃，呃，要告诉你
I have something, uh, uh, to tell you.

1802
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:29,977
我..
I'm...

1803
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,608
我是一个同性恋
I'm a homosexual.

1804
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:38,646
好吧
All right.

1805
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,312
不，我喜欢男人，琼…
No, no. M-Men, Joan...

1806
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,423
呃，不是女人
uh, not women.

1807
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,650
- 那又怎样？ -嗯
- So what?   - Well,

1808
01:32:45,827 --> 01:32:46,851
我刚刚告诉你了
I-I just told you.

1809
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,962
我说那又怎样？
So what?

1810
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,191


1811
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:53,892
我有我的疑虑；我总是那样
I had my suspicions;I always did.

1812
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,060
但我们不像其他人
But we're not like other people.

1813
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,205
我们以我们自己的方式相爱者着
We love each other in our own way,

1814
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,774
只要我们想就可以生活在一起
and we can have the life together that we want.

1815
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,502
你-你…你不会是完美的丈夫
You-you... you won't be the perfect husband.

1816
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,043
好吧，我可以告诉你
Well,I can promise you,

1817
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:07,477
我也没想成为一个完美的妻子
I have no intention of being the perfect wife.

1818
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:10,117
我不会...整天等你
I'll not be... fixing your lamb all day

1819
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:12,276
下班回家
while you come home from the office.

1820
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,115
我要工作
I'll work.

1821
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:16,223
你也要工作
You'll work.

1822
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:20,624
但我们拥有彼此的陪伴
And we'll have each other's company.

1823
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,627
和彼此的心灵
We'll have each other's minds.

1824
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,732
这听起来不像一个最美好的婚姻
That sounds like a better marriage than most.

1825
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:31,295
但我在乎你
Because I care for you.

1826
01:33:31,473 --> 01:33:35,239
你在乎我
And you care for me.

1827
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,935
我们可以比别人…
And we understand one another more than...

1828
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:39,706
更多的了解彼此
more than anyone else ever has.

1829
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,078
我没有
I don't.

1830
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:48,921
-什么？   -在乎你
- What?  - Care for you.

1831
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,580
我从来没有
I never did.

1832
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,420
我只需要你破解英格玛
L-I just needed you to break Enigma.

1833
01:33:53,595 --> 01:33:56,690
现在我已经完成了，所以…所以你可以走了
I've done that now, so... so you can go.

1834
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,500
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

1835
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:06,936
我已经花了我太多的生命去
I've spent entirely too much of my life

1836
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:09,008
担心你是怎么想我的
worried about what you think of me,

1837
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:10,645
我父母是怎么想我
or what my parents think of me,

1838
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,247
或者是八组的男生和三组的女生是怎么想我的
or the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3.

1839
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,939
你知道吗？我受够了
And do you know what? I'm done.

1840
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:19,178
这是我能做的最重要的工作
This is the most important work I will ever do,

1841
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:21,652
没有人能阻止我
and no one is going to stop me.

1842
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,313
即便是你
Least of all, you.

1843
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,852
你知道吗，他们是对的
You know what, they were right.

1844
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,965
休，彼得，约翰
Peter, Hugh, John.

1845
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:37,132
你真的是个混蛋
You really are a monster.

1846
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:41,769


1847
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:52,016


1848
01:34:54,389 --> 01:34:57,723
这场战争又持续了...
The war dragged on for two more...

1849
01:34:57,892 --> 01:35:01,192
两年...
solitary years...

1850
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,490
我们每天都进行
and every day we performed

1851
01:35:03,665 --> 01:35:07,295
我们该死的演算
our blood-soaked calculus.

1852
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:11,837
每一天我们都决定究竟谁死谁活
Every day we decided who lived and who died.

1853
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,303
我们每一天…
Every day we...

1854
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:17,502
都在帮助盟国打胜战，但没有人知道
helped the Allies to victories,and nobody knew.

1855
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,479

所有的胜利如果我们提供得情报
All victories that would not have been possible

1860
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:32,152
都是不可能发生的
without the intelligence that we supplied.

1861
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:35,155
人们…
And people...

1862
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:39,324
会谈论这场战争，这场，额...
talk about the war as this epic battle between, um...

1863
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,867
文明...
civilizations...

1864
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:43,868
自由与专制
freedom versus tyranny,

1865

船舰沉入海底

1869
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,611
飞机从空中投下炸弹

1870
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,253
就像乌云一般遮挡住了太阳...
until they obliterated the sun itself...

1871
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,615


1872
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:04,452
但是战场对我们来说不是那样的
The war wasn't like that for us.

1873
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:07,727
对我们来说，战场是...
For us, it was just...

1874
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,388
...七八个填字游戏爱好者

1875
01:36:11,566 --> 01:36:14,729
住在英国南部一个的小村庄里

这是…

1877
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,937
你的胜利

1878
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:22,304
胜利…
Victory...

1879
01:36:22,477 --> 01:36:24,502
是属于每一片争取

1880
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:26,271
自由的土地
in every land.

1881
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,245


1882
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,585
这是一个庄严而光荣的时刻

1883

01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,984
能活着看到这一天

1886
01:36:41,663 --> 01:36:43,722
不，因为…
No. Because...

1887
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:46,424
上帝没有赢得战争

1888
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:48,626
我们做到了
We did.

1889
01:36:52,674 --> 01:36:55,837


1890
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,069


1891
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:04,751
所以，现在怎么办？
So, what happens now?

1892
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:08,685
难道...让我们都回到大学？
Is it... back to university for us, I suppose?

1893
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:10,415
是的，差不多
Yes, pretty much.

1894
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:11,922
但是你们剩下最后一件事情要

01:37:12,093 --> 01:37:13,185
给你的政府服务

1897
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,428
烧掉一切

1898
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:19,623
- 烧掉?为什么？   -在你们开始的时候
- Burn? Why?      - You were told when you started

1899
01:37:19,801 --> 01:37:24,534
说过这是一个绝密计划……你认为我们在开玩笑吗？
This was a top-secret program...did you think we were joking?

1900
01:37:24,706 --> 01:37:26,435
- 但是战争已经结束             -只是这场而已
- But the war is over.         - This war is.

1901
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:28,302
但还会有其他战争的
But there'll be others.

1902
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:30,672
而且我们知道如何破译

1903
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:34,110
大家都认为牢不可破的密码
that everybody else believes is unbreakable.

1904
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:36,683
正是如此
Precisely.

1905
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,149
尘归尘，土归土
Tear it down.Light it up.

01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,845
忘掉该忘的

01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,387
你从来没有见过
None of you have ever met before.

1908
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:45,959
你从来没有听说过英格玛这个词
None of you have ever even heard the word Enigma.

1909
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:50,226
回家一路顺风
Have a safe trip home.

1910
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:55,832
另外，运气好的话，你永远不会
Behave. With a bit of luck, you'll never have

1911
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:59,462
在你的余生见到我或者是其他人

1912
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:17,722
难以置信
That's unbelievable.

1913
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,056
现在，警探
Now, Detective,

1914
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,392
你来判断
you get to judge.

1915
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:29,731
告诉我…
So, tell me...

1916
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,929

嗯，我是..
Mm, am I...

1918
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:35,968
机器？

1919
01:38:36,177 --> 01:38:38,441
还是人类？
Am I a person?

1920
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:41,105
我是一个战争英雄？
Am I a war hero?

1921
01:38:43,151 --> 01:38:45,779
还是一个罪犯？
Am I a criminal?

1922
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:51,286
我无法判断
I can't judge you.

1923
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:56,393
好吧，那么…
Well, then...

1924
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,234
……你一点也没有帮到我
...you're no help to me at all.

1925
01:39:03,805 --> 01:39:05,967
进来
Come in.

1926
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,131


1927
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:12,941
你要见我吗，先生？
You wanted to see me, sir?

1928
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,014
图灵，请坐
Turing. Sit down.

1929
01:39:15,216 --> 01:39:18,208


1930
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:21,821


1931
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:29,161
发生什么事了吗？
Something the matter?

1932
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:32,163
听说你和克里斯托弗莫科姆走得很近
You and Christopher Morcom are quite close.

1933
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,528
我不好说
I wouldn't say that.

1934
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:35,133
嗯，你的数学老师

1935
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,397
说你们两个形影不离

01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,734
我们班里最好的学生
We're the best students in the class.

1937
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,274
那天他抓住你们传纸条了
He caught you passing notes the other day.

1938
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:45,572
密码学，用来打发时间的，那节课太简单了
Cryptography, to pass the time. The class is too simple.

1939
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:49,182
你和你的朋友在数学课堂用数学来解决问题
You and your friend solve maths problems during maths class

1940
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,409
是因为数学课太无聊了？
because the maths class is too dull?

1941
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:53,418
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

1942
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:55,852
好吧，我听说他是你唯一的朋友
Well, I'm told he's your only friend.

1943
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:57,650
谁说的？
Who said that?

1944
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:03,429
关于莫科姆发生了一些事
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1945
01:40:03,598 --> 01:40:05,965
我为什么在这里？
Why am I here?

1946
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:11,299
克里斯托弗去世了
Christopher is dead.

1947
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,772


1948
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,711
我不明白
I don't understand.

1949
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:21,872
他的母亲今天早上派人送来的消息
His mother sent word this morning.

1950
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,541
他们一家人在度假，你知道的
The family were on holiday, you see.

1951
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,355
我不理解
I don't understand.

1952
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,051
嗯，他有牛结核病
Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,

1953
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:35,457
我相信他告诉过你
as I'm sure he told you.

1954
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,962
所以一切不是那么突然，但是...
So this won't come as a shock, but...

1955
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,226
仍然，同样的
still, all the same,

1956
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:42,995
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1957
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:46,071
你搞错了
You're mistaken.

1958
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,709
他没告诉你吗？
Did he not tell you?

1959
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,504
嗯，他已经病了很长时间
Well, he's been sick for a long time.

1960
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,205
他知道这是必然的
He knew this was coming soon.

1961
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,908
但他还咬是坚持来上课
But he had a stiff upper lip about it.

1962
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,576
真是个好孩子
Good lad.

1963
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:02,382
-你没事吧，图灵？                   -是的，当然
- Are you all right, Turing?        - Yes. Of course.

1964
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,254
就像我说的，我不是很了解他
Like I said,I didn't know him very well.

1965
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,952
啊，我知道了
Ah. I see.

1966
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:10,096
那好吧
Very well.

1967
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,593
我可以走了吗，校长？
May I leave, Headmaster?

1968
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:19,070


1969
01:41:30,117 --> 01:41:32,552
恭喜你，长官
Congratulations, sir.

1970
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,063


1971
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,864


1972
01:41:54,809 --> 01:41:56,368


1973
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:00,271
对不起

那你要说些什么，我，呃…

我不是同性恋

1978
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:15,586
艾伦…这是很严重的事

01:42:15,763 --> 01:42:17,094
他们会送你去监狱的
They could send you to jail.

01:44:50,918 --> 01:44:52,147


2030
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,914
我们为什么不做填字游戏呢
Why don't we do a crossword puzzle.

2031
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,889
它只会花费我们五分钟
It'll only take us five minutes.

2032
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:00,584
或者，以你的要求，六分钟

01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:54,810


2044
01:45:54,982 --> 01:45:57,212


2045
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:02,045
没有一个平凡人能做到那样

2046

你知道吗，今天早上…

经过一个城市，如果不是因为你
that went through a city that wouldn't exist

2049
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,469
它将是不存在的
if it wasn't for you.

2050
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:18,867
我从一个男人那买了一张票
I bought a ticket from a man

2051
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:22,566

现在，如果你真的希望你可以变得平凡…

我可以向你保证我没有

这个世界是无限美好的地方

2058
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:52,001
正是因为你的不平凡

01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:56,399
你…
Do you...

2060

你真的这么认为？
do you really think that?

2061

我认为…
I think...

2062
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:05,050
有时候正是人们
that sometimes it is the people

2063

意想不到之人
who no one imagines anything of

2064

意想不到之事
that no one can imagine.

在持续了一年的强制治疗之后, 
图灵于1954年6月7日自杀身亡

2068
01:48:27,899 --> 01:48:30,199
享年41岁

以此对他前所未有的贡献表示敬意

2071
01:48:58,494 --> 01:49:05,494

拯救了超过一千四百万人的生命

2072
01:49:09,878 --> 01:49:13,278
这些秘密被政府保管50年后公开

2073
01:49:20,809 --> 01:49:25,809
图灵的工作鼓舞了几代人投入到被科学界称为“图灵机”的研究当中

2074
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:32,090
今天我们叫它“电脑”
