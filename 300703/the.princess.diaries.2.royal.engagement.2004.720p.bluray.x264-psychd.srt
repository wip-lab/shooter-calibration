尽管你们的毕业证书相当管用 记住
Although your diplomas are equally specific, remember:

2
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,920
你们是独自去闯世界
you are all going out into the world as individuals.

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,360
现在 我很荣幸的介绍
I now proudly present

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:39,060
今年伍得罗威尔逊公共国际事物学院的

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,030
公主日记
Dear diary.

10
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,510
是我 全新的大学公主毕业生
Well, it's me. Brand-new college graduate-slash-princess.

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,740
哦 真不敢相信已经五年了
Oh, I can't believe it's been five years

12
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,680
从奶奶告诉我 我是个公主算起
since Grandma told me that I was a princess.

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,310
我? 公主? 闭嘴
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,480
自从那以后 我妈妈令我感到很吃惊
And right after that, my mother surprised me

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,120
她同我高中老师帕特里克・奥柯奈尔结了婚
by marrying my high-school teacher, Patrick O'Connell.

16
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,220
一切都会好的 因为他们希望能有一个孩子
It must be going well, because they are now expecting a baby.

17
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
莉莉还是老样子 一如既往的制造麻烦
Lilly's remained the same, as she continues to cause turmoil,

18
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,160
但是现在作为一个柏克利的毕业生
but now as a graduate student at Berkeley.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,800
她一直叫它"柏斯克利"
Which she calls "Berserkeley."

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,700
你可能会问"麦克怎么样了?"
"How's Michael?" you may ask.

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,840
自从他和他的乐队全国巡回演出后 我们现在只是朋友
Well, we're just friends now, as he went off to tour the country with his band.

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,510
米娅公主
Princess Mia.

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,650
看看窗外 欢迎回到基诺维亚
Look out the window, and welcome back to Genovia.

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,700
哦 是的 我美丽的基诺维亚
Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia.

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,140
当然 能够回来我很激动 但是也有一点紧张
Of course, I'm completely excited to be going back, but I'm also a bit nervous.

26
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,200
基诺维亚一号已经着陆
Genovia One has landed.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,300
奶奶克拉丽斯今年年底将从女皇的位置退下来
Grandma Clarisse will step down by the end of this year as queen,

28
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,010
我将会接任 这时我是21岁
and I'll be taking over, since I'm now 21.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,070
看啊 米娅公主
Mira, la princesa Mia.

30
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,050
这是来自美国的公主 你好!
It's the princess from America! Hi.

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,880
公主万岁
Viva la princesa.

32
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,790
我知道我在学校里学的是外交和政治 但是
I know I studied diplomacy and political science at school, but...

33
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,490
没有一门课程是关于"女皇"和"如何管理国家"的
there is no course in "Queen, " or "How To Run A Country 1 0 1."

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,970
但是奶奶会教我 在她认为我准备好了的时候会让我接任
But Grandma's going to help me, and I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready.

35
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,900
当然 我会想 我什么时候才能准备好呢?
Of course, I wonder... will I ever be ready?

36
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,100
在这期间 我会住在一个像童话般漂亮的宫殿里
In the meantime, I'm going to live in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale,

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,670
并最终登上王座 来统治基诺维亚的人民
and eventually sit on a throne and rule the people of Genovia.

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,910
那样会很恐怖或是什么的吗?
Is that scary or what?

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,440
好了 或许胖路易会帮助我的
Well, maybe Fat Louie can give me some help.

40
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,000

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,870
在我的童话里 有件沮丧的事情就是我从未恋爱过
The one downer in my fairy tale is I've never been in love.

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,510

但是你迟到了 殿下

他擦了须后水 好让别人认为他很成熟
He wears aftershave to make people think that he's older.

120
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,010

女皇祝您早安 公主 她正在和国会议员开会
The queen bids you good morning, Princess. She's in session with parliament.

144
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,510
-好的  -您应该已经见过您的女仆了
- OK.  - I see you've met your lady's maids.

145
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,820
是的
Yeah. Um...

146
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,460
-能不能不用屈膝礼?  -哦
- How do you turn off the curtsies?  - Oh.

147
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,460
好了 去干你们的事吧
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.

148
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,500
殿下一个小时内会在王宫见您
Her Majesty will meet you in one hour at the throne room.

149
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,230
-好的  -很抱歉您的房间还没有准备好
- OK.  - I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.

150
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,960
但您可以在殿下的房间住下来
But you're welcome to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...

151
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,870
不 不 不 不 没关系
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,340
嘿 我能去看看皇宫的其他地方吗?
Hey, can I explore the palace a little bit?

153
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,960
当然
Of course.

154
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,100
哦 你已经见过毛瑞斯了
Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.

155
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,800
你好 毛
Hey, Mo.

156
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,610
王宫 一个小时内
The throne room, in an hour.

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,980
基诺维亚的国会开始开会 由莫塔兹首相主持
The parliament of Genovia is in session. Prime Minister Motaz presiding.

158
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,550
马布雷子爵 你可以发言了
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.

159
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,920
马布雷阁下 你可以发言了
Monsieur Mabrey, s'il vous plait.

160
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,990
我们都知道 基诺维亚皇室血统的继承人的21岁的生日
As we all know, the 21 st birthday of an heir to the Genovian bloodline

161
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,330
的确是一件全国的大事
is indeed a matter of great public significance.

162
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,810
它意味着这个年轻人有资格戴上皇冠
It signifies that this young person is eligible to assume the crown.

163
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,270
的确 我们都认识到了 子爵
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.

164
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,110
女皇已经指出米娅公主
The queen has already indicated that Princess Mia

165
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,080
在戴上皇冠之前还要学很多这方面的知识
intends to learn more at her side before assuming the throne.

166
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,580
我指的不是米娅公主
It was not Princess Mia to whom I was referring.

167
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,710
谢瓦利埃国王
King Chevalier

168
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,780
是曾曾曾祖父
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...

169
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,450
你好
Hello?

170
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,260
哦哦
Ah... Oh.

171
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,690
继续
Proceed.

172
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,810
好极了
Nice.

173
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,140
有人吗?
Hello?

174
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,330
因此
So.

175
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,030
在去年的10月20日
As of the 20th of October last year,

176
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,840
在他21岁生日的时候
on the occasion of his 21 st birthday,

177
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,750
另外一个基诺维亚的皇家血统已经有资格戴上皇冠了
another Genovian of the royal bloodline became eligible to assume the throne.

178
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
什么?
What?

179
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,220
我的侄子 德弗里奥克斯亲王
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

180
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,780
请你再说一遍
I beg your pardon?

181
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,820
我侄子的母亲是我夫人的姐姐
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

182
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,630
因此殿下 我很高兴的说
Therefore, Your Majesty, I am pleased to say

183
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,070
我的侄子准备接替他的位置
that my nephew is ready to take his place

184
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,130
作为基诺维亚公正的国王
as Genovia's rightful king.

185
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,180
闭嘴
Shut up.

186
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,770
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

187
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,480
-我的意思是  -"闭嘴"并不总是闭嘴的意思
- I mean...  - "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.

188
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,020
在美国 它就像"天啊""上帝"
In America, it's like "Oh, my," "Gee whiz, " "Wow."

189
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,250
-"梦幻般的" "华丽的" "Oy vey"  -谢谢 首相先生
- "Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey."  - Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,920
但是米娅公主不是王室的第一继承人吗?
But isn't Princess Mia first in line to ascend the throne?

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,290
并不是这样的
Not yet.

192
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,160
基诺维亚法律规定 公主必须结婚
Genovian law states that a princess must marry

193
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,860
在她登上王座之前
before she can take the throne.

194
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,500
我们从没有执行过那样的法律
We have never enforced that law.

195
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,510
一个男人就不必在当上国王之前结婚了
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

196
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,340
我的意思是 这是21世纪了 看在上帝的份上
I mean, this is the 21 st century, for heaven's sake.

197
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,610
我的孙女应该拥有和其他男人同样的权力
My granddaughter should be given the same rights as any man.

198
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,210
对!
Yeah!

199
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,220
基诺维亚不应该要女皇 以免她会陷进婚姻的束缚中
Genovia shall have no queen lest she be bound in matrimony.

200
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,690
帕利莫阁下?
Lord Palimore?

201
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,330
那是过去300年的基诺维亚法律
That is the law of Genovia for the last 300 years.

202
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,860
米娅公主没有资格统治 因为她没有结婚
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule because she is unmarried.

203
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,370
请宽恕我 殿下
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,540
我们并不认为米娅公主
Not all of us are sure that the princess

205
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,210
就是统治我们国家最好的继承人
is the most suitable choice to govern our great nation.

206
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,150
好了 好了 先生们 先生们
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

207
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,160
我建议这位尊敬的阁下
I suggest this honored body

208
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,420
给米娅公主一年的时间
allow Princess Mia one year,

209
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,590
在这段时间内她必须结婚
during which time she must marry,

210
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,900
否则将有德弗里奥克斯亲王接替她成为基诺维亚的国王
or she forfeits the throne of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.

211
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,330
什么? 不行
What? No.

212
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,370
-我反对 最强烈的反对  -一年?
- I object. I object most strongly.  - One year?

213
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,030
-60天  -2个月
- 60 days.  - Two months.

214
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,510
60天?
60 days?

215
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,310
30天
30 days.

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,850
国会怎么能让我在30天内就谈恋爱? 这就像...
How could parliament expect me to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

217
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,650
这就像一个给我包办婚姻的大陷阱
It's like it's a big trick to get me to have an arranged marriage, or...

218
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,350
不行
No.

219
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,090
不 这没有 就这样决定了 这没有这是我
No, there's no... That's it, there's no "or." There's... I...

220
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,220
包办婚姻是我唯一的选择
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

221
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,500
什么人能够同意这种包办婚姻的呢?
What kind of person agrees to an arranged marriage?

222
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
你同意了这个包办婚姻
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

223
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,210
-对  -是的
- Right.  - Yes, I did.

224
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,010
它肯定会很壮观
And it turned out quite splendidly.

225
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,920
他是我最好的朋友 我们都很喜欢对方
He was my best friend. We grew very fond of each other.

226
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,610
我肯定 奶奶 但是
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

227
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,920
我梦想爱情 但不沉迷于此
I dream of love, not fondness.

228
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,190
但你不必这样做 米娅 你不一定要成为女皇的
But you don't have to do this, Mia. You don't have to become queen.

229
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,270
这不公平
This is so unfair.

230
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,140
阿米莉娅
Amelia.

231
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,580
勇气不是逃避恐惧
Courage is not the absence of fear,

232
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:34,390
而是判断 有一些事情会比恐惧
but rather the judgment that something else is more important...

233
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,790
更重要
than fear.

234
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,120
雷纳尔迪挂在这个墙上已经有550年了
There are 550 years of Renaldis on these walls.

235
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,870
我也将被挂在靠近我父亲的地方
And I will be up there next to my father.

236
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,630
我坚信 作为一个统治者 我能有一些机会做一些改变
I'm sure I want my chance to make a difference as a ruler.

237
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,140
你这就像一个真正的女皇在说话
Spoken like a true queen.

238
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,150
哦 我的孩子 一个拥有基诺维亚血统的孩子
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

239
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,190
你应该成为我们的国王
You should be our king.

240
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,550
我同意
I agree.

241
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,290
但是 我们怎么才可以做到呢?
But how can we make it happen?

242
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,290
给我一枝镖
Give me one of your arrows.

243
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,930
我给你表演个从一个意大利老哲学家那学来的把戏
I'm going to show you a trick that I learned from an old ltalian philosopher.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,870
尼克洛・马基雅弗利
Niccolo Machiavelli.

245
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,640
我能让这只镖每次都击中靶心
I can make this dart hit the bull's-eye every time.

246
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,720
是的 但那是在作弊
Yes, but that is cheating.

247
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,760
你说对了
You've got it.

248
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,480
德弗里奥克斯亲王和他叔叔很快会到 考特太太
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly, Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.

249
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,760
是的 殿下
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,700
-殿下  -嗯?
- Your Majesty.  - Hm?

251
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,470
我知道莱昂内尔是首相的侄子
I know Lionel is the prime minister's nephew

252
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,670
他整个夏天一直在做实习医师
and he's interning for the summer

253
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,500
因为他想学更多的安全知识
because he wants to learn about security.

254
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,910
但他还是站在我们这边 他始终和我们在一起
But he never leaves my side. He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.

255
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,210
不会太久了 他秋天的时候会回学校的
It won't last very long. He returns to school in the autumn.

256
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,540
-他想拜见您  -什么 现在?
- He wants an audience with you.  - What, now?

257
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,610
现在
Now.

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
莱昂内尔?
Lionel?

259
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,180
快点
Short.

260
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,620
我不知道你是否见过我们的女管家考特太太
I don't know if you've met Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

261
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,030
普里希拉和奥莉维亚 我的女仆
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.

262
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,890
我正在调查奥莉维亚背景
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

263
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,090
不必了 莱昂内尔
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.

264
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,100
这个房间的每个人都可以优先排除
Everybody in this room has high-priority clearance.

265
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,610
当然 当然
Of course, of course.

266
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,140
-殿下  -嗯?
- Your Majesty?  - Hm?

267
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,200
我很愿意为你挡一颗子弹
I would gladly take a bullet for you.

268
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,040
哦 真勇敢
Oh, how brave.

269
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,140
很多实习医师都不愿帮我拿茶
Most interns don't even want to fetch me my tea.

270
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,190
车已经备好了 女士
The limousine is at the gates, madam.

271
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,020
子爵没有来 只来了他的侄子
The viscount is not staying, just the nephew.

272
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,500
乔瑟夫 我希望你能够保护他 并且时刻盯住他
Joseph, I want you to protect him and keep your eye on him at all times.

273
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,970
-当然 莱昂内尔  -哦 你好
- Of course. Lionel.  - Oh, hello.

274
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,870
这样欢迎子爵和他的侄子可以吗?
So is this all right to welcome the viscount and his nephew?

275
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,770
非常合适 非常漂亮
Very appropriate. And pretty.

276
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,800
我不敢相信国会邀请了这个男的
Oh, I can't believe parliament invited the guy

277
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,850
他正在试图偷走皇冠 并和我们一起呆在皇宫里
who's trying to steal the throne to stay here with us at the palace.

278
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,150
哦 不 国会并没有邀请他
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

279
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,980
是我邀请的
I did.

280
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,350
什么
What...

281
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,980
我建议把他挂在我们的后花园
I offered to have him hung by his toes in our courtyard.

282
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,620
-对不起  -是的 乔的建议怎么样?
- Excuse me.  - Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?

283
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,720
不 如果有任何状况发生 我希望都能够在我的控制之下
No. If there's any mischief going on, I'd prefer it be right under my nose.

284
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,970
你知道 这不是非常困难的工作
It's not a very difficult job, you know.

285
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,340
在乘客老死之前 你应该打开门
You just have to open the door before the passenger dies of old age.

286
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,210
-你好 欢迎你  -你的人不合格也不可靠
- Hello, I'm here to welcome you.  - Your staff is incompetent and unreliable.

我不想对这个家伙太好 你知道吗?
I just so don't want to be nice to this guy, you know?

I mean, he is rude, he's arrogant, self-centered, he's...

291
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,520
是的 可能他是 奶奶 我是说
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma. I mean...

292
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,160
现在 就像一个突发事件一样 他想成为基诺维亚的国王
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he wants to be the king of Genovia?

293
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,070
-还是什么别的?  -哦 呸
- What is that about?  - Oh, tush.

294
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,800
不管他是什么 我们都要很尊重他
Whatever he is, we will be charm itself.

295
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,360
我们要表现的很优雅和高贵

一次意外
An accident.

311
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,200
当然

312
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,510
她正在学习弗拉门戈舞
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.

313
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,920
您能解释一下刚才发生在外面的事情吗

314
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,480
对不起
Sorry.

315
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,790
实际上 我已经见过尼古拉斯亲王了
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.

316
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,060
是的 在舞会上 我不知道他的身份
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know who he was, so, you know, we...

317
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,830
我们一起跳舞 并且我对他有些感觉
We danced, and I flirted.

318
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,170
现在我觉得我真是太笨了
I feel so stupid right now.

319
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,610
我明白了 作为女皇 我是绝对不能宽恕的
I see. Well, as your queen I absolutely cannot condone it.

320
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,440
作为奶奶 我要说 好极了
As a grandma, I say, "right on."

328
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,570
但是不幸的是 我们要鲁柏特的堂兄来布置浴室
but unfortunately we asked Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.

329
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,940
这是一个教训 任人唯亲只会让事情越来越糟
It's a good lesson. Nepotism belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.

330
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,320
这是你自己真正的房间
This is your very own suite.

这太酷了
This is so cool.

338
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,680

Ah, Fat Louie. I think he rather likes his new abode as well.

339
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,090
这儿还有
There's more.

340
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,630
-这也是我的?  -你为什么不去自己看看呢?
- Is that mine?  - Why don't you go and find out?

341

346
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,630
奶奶 你觉得怎么样?
What do you think? Grandma?

347
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,190
我在这
I'm here.

348
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,640

They're yours to borrow, with great discretion, at appropriate times.

353
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,830
现在 让你看看最让你吃惊的东西
Now for the best surprise of all.

354
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,510
太漂亮了 奶奶 但是我有些失望 我不想说谎...
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...

355
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,590
-你在这  -我知道
- You're here.  - I know I'm here.

356

361

让你们两位女士好好的闹闹
I think I'll let you two ladies catch up with each other.

362
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,530

I can't believe you're here. When did your flight get in?

363
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,100
-刚到不久  -哦
- Just a little while ago.  - Oh.

364
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,670

I got it.

这曾经是我曾祖母的订婚戒指

我不记得他曾经那样对我说过

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,090
当然 你当然不记得 他死的时候 你才6岁
Well, you wouldn't. You were only six years old when he died.

461
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,530
但你一定记得他给你起的谁的名字 是吗?
But you do remember who he named you after, don't you?

471
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,390
他不会离开太久的 为什么我们要这么小声说话呢?
He won't be gone long. Why are we whispering?

472
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,520
我正在躲我的女仆
I'm hiding from my lady's maids.

473
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,930

But I'm fine, I'm fine.

474

-你后悔了?  -没有

475
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,880
实际上 正好相反 我已经开始喜欢我的戒指了
Actually, on the contrary. I was just admiring my ring.

476
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,920
这是安德鲁的奶奶的
It was Andrew's grandmother's.

477
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,790
你也看到了 他真的很浪漫

好了 如果不介意 我现在想去看看婚礼准备情况
Well, if you'll excuse me, I really must go see to some wedding details.

479
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,930
对不起 你是不是有什么话想对我说?
I'm sorry, is there something you wanted to say to me?

No, no.

481
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,170
你是个用大脚踩我的人
You are the one who stomped on me with your big feet.

482
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,070
大脚?
Big feet?

483
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,010
布丽奇特 我找到她了
Brigitte, I found her.

484
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,140
啊 布丽奇塔
Uh, Brigitta.

485
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,910
说我不在这
I'm not here.

486
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,680
那不是她 那是幽灵 嗯
It wasn't her. It was a ghost. Whoo...

487
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,820
好吧 你和我的大脚一起跳过舞
Well, you know, you danced with my big feet.

488
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,620
好吧 我和你一起跳舞 叫海牙军事法庭来审判吧
Fine. I danced with you. Call The Hague, convene the war-crimes tribunal.

489
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,790
米娅 我想起我们曾经一起跳过大约一分钟的舞
Mia, I would remind you that we only danced for about a minute.

490
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,300
不只一分钟
It was more than a minute.

491
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,430
好吧 可能是一分半钟
Well, maybe a minute and a half.

492
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,440
好吧 是一分半钟 但是那是一个谎言
Fine. It was a minute and a half, but it was also a lie,

493
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,910
因为你没有告诉我你的身份 并且你想偷走我的皇冠
because you didn't tell me who you were and that you were trying to steal my crown.

494
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,880
请原谅我 当时我可能有些失礼了
Please pardon me, I just had a momentary lapse of good manners.

495
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,890
通常我邀请女士跳舞时 我会告诉她我的家族史的
You see, usually, when I ask a woman to dance, I always show her my family tree.

496
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,680
哦 好吧 你不够
Oh. Well, aren't you just...

497
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,650
狡猾
crafty.

498
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,060
-让我们看看舞厅  -舞厅?
-Let's look in the ballroom.  -The ballroom?

499
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,860
-我想她不在舞厅  -是的
- I don't think she's in the ballroom.  - Well.

500
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,160
你想知道你还干了些什么吗?
Do you want to know what else you were doing,

501
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,990
在你跳那段欺骗的舞蹈的时候
while you were doing your little lie dance?

502
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,830
-欺骗的舞蹈?  -舞厅?
- Lie dance?  -The ballroom?

503
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,420
-是的 那就是你做的  -欺骗的舞蹈是什么?
- Yeah, that is exactly what you did.  - What is a lie dance?

504
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,700
我将亲自去看看舞厅
I'll go look in the ballroom myself.

505
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,670
好的
All right.

506
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,540
欺骗的舞蹈不是关键
The lie dance is not the point.

507
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,980
-关键是...  -关键是什么?
- The point is that...  - What is the point?

508

我
I...

509
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,410
关键是我在你之上 就在你努力想得到的那个位置
The point is that I'm onto you. Oh boy, am I onto what you are trying to do.

510
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,920
-我想努力得到什么位置?  -我想我们都清楚是什么位置
- And what am I trying to do?  - I think we both know exactly what that is.

511
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,430
请原谅我的打扰 殿下 德瑞福克斯亲王

她具备女皇的素质吗?

她还年轻 但我一直都相信她

克拉丽斯 亲爱的 先忘掉婚礼吧

首先 一只手故意拿着扇子的把

这是用来交流的很好的工具 就这样

你在耍你的奶奶吗?
Are you sassing your grandma?

554
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,630
我从没有耍过你 奶奶
I would never sass you, Grandma.

555

这也是一种让人生气的方式
This is also a way of showing you're annoyed.

你必须公正 诚实
One has to be fair and very honest.

公主 没事了 公主 我在这
Princess. It's OK, Princess. I'm here.

623
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,420
难怪她那么笨拙 原来她用了一个木腿
No wonder she's so clumsy. She's got a wooden leg.

624
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,820

那么能不能 让我自己好好的哭一次?
So just this once, can you please let me be miserable,

635
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,780
让我感觉并没有太糟

and to be frank, she's spent little time here since then.

嗯 如果让她来治理这个国家也许会不错
Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if she ran the country.

1023
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,510
你疯了么?
Are you mad?

1024
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,280
她信任基诺维亚所以她也相信自己
She believes in Genovia so much that she's convinced herself

1025
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,690
要嫁给一个自己并不爱的人
to marry someone that she knows she can never love.

1026
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,060
我不能相信居然听到了这些 你想让她来统治国家?
I can't believe that I am hearing this. You want her to rule?

1027
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,400
毕竟我们付出了努力 就这样无为而终?
After all the effort that we have put in,  to end up with nothing?

1028
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:54,840
并不是 基诺维亚会被治理的很好 而且她会快乐的
It wouldn't be nothing. Genovia would be in good hands, and she would be happy.

What do you think will happen? That she will leave Andrew and marry you?

1035

我耗尽精力要让你当上国王
I put in the effort to make you a king, 

1036
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,560
不是让你娶一个公主 我不会让这种情况发生的 先生
not to have you marry a queen. I will not have it, sir.

1037
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,090
别担心 叔叔 那不会发生的 米娅在那方面并不在乎我
Don't worry, Uncle. That will never happen. Mia doesn't care for me that way.

1038
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,660
哦 但是你在乎她
Oh, but you care for her.

1039
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,800
叔叔 我只是想我们不要再对她使坏了 就是这样
Uncle, I just want us to stop trying to sabotage her. That's all.

1040

好的 如果这就是你真正想要的
All right. If that's what you really want.

1041

That's enough flaming ones for now.

1048
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,320
你肯定我没有烧伤你?
Are you sure I didn't burn you?

1049
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,490
-当然烧伤了 看看他的外套  -不 不 这没什么
-Of course you did. Look at his coat.  -No, no, it's very minor.

1050
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,660
只是袖子有些烧焦 看
You just sort of seared the sleeve. Look.

1051
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,630
对不起
Sorry.

1052
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,670

1058
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,190
-退下 安德鲁?  -什么事?
-Backing off, please. Andrew?  -Yes?

1059
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,860
你为什么不去把莉莉介绍给你的父母呢?
Why don't you go introduce Lilly to your parents?

1060
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,700
告诉他们 我马上就去吃饭
You know, just tell them I'll be up for brunch in a second.

他不是她要嫁的那个人 是么?
He's not the one she's marrying, is he?

With only two and a half days left, Olivia,  I'm beginning to feel rather frantic.

我得检查一下乐队挑选的如何了

不 约瑟夫 你必须知道我要说什么
No, Joseph. You had to know what I was going to say.

你从来就不只是我的女王 克拉丽斯

你是我想共度一生的人

但是 如果你希望我首先把你当成我的女王...
But, if you prefer that I see you first and foremost as my queen...

你的床铺好了 殿下

1129
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,680
而且我对你的诗没有任何反应 它太差劲了
And I won't respond to that line, it's far too cheesy.

1130
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,480
他想干什么?
So what does he want?

1131
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,020
他想让我从藤上爬下去
He wants me to climb down the vine.

1132

1133
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,590

你知道的 他昨晚没有弄到做果汁的真是 羞耻啊 你这个小人
You know, it's really a shame he didn't get juicier stuff last night, you jerk.

米娅 我和这件事根本无关 我发誓
Mia, I have nothing to do with this. I swear.

最近事情的确压力很大
Things have been so pressured lately.

1202
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,060
我在想我们是不是应该...
I was wondering whether we should spend...

1203
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,690

我发誓这是唯一的皇室
And here's the royal exclusive I promised,

1211
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,990
基诺维亚终于有了一个世界级的丑闻

1212
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,080
假设我们很久以前带进来一个美国人

Or will Lord Nicholas Devereaux be the new king?

1216

现在对米娅公主来说相当于从煎锅 出来又跳进了火里
It's out of the frying pan and into the fire for Princess Mia, 

1217

保持你的鸡蛋蛋黄向上

安德鲁 等一下 我向你发誓什么也没有发生

01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,740
问问你们自己：
and ask yourselves:.

1416
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:53,580
你们会强迫她们去做 你们让我做的事情么?
would you force them to do what you're trying to make me do?

1417
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:59,450
我相信我会成为一个伟大的女王
I believe I will be a great queen.

1418
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,860
我了解基诺维亚是一块过去美丽
I understand Genovia to be a land that combines the beauty of the past

1419
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:06,860
将来充满希望的土地
with all the best hope of the future, 

1420
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,870
-现在不行  -嘘
-Not now.  -Shh.

1421
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:13,230
我从心底和灵魂深处感觉到我可以 治理好基诺维亚
I feel in my heart and soul that I can rule Genovia.

1422

我...我爱基诺维亚

1423
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:21,210
如果不是 你们觉得我会穿着一身婚纱站在这么?
Do you think that I would be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?

1424
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:24,650
我站在这
I stand here, 

1425
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,950
是准备做你们的女王的

没有丈夫的女王
Without a husband.

1427
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,220

每次...
Every time...

1429
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:49,000
每次这个迷人的年轻女士张开她的嘴
Every time this charming young lady opens her mouth, 

1430
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:55,030
她总是对基诺维亚的传统做出蔑视
she demonstrates a contempt for the customs of Genovia.

1431
01:35:55,110 --> 01:36:01,050
法律明确指出 一个未婚女子不可以成为女王
The law clearly states an unmarried woman cannot be queen.

1432
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:04,910
幸运的是
Fortunately, 

1433
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,460
这还有另一个继承人
there is another heir.

1434

不 没有
No, there is not.

1435
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,690
我拒绝 我不想当国王
I decline. I refuse to be king.

1436
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:20,670
女士们先生们 米娅公主才是应该继位的人
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia who should have the crown.

1437
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:23,370
她聪明 有同情心
She's bright, and she is caring.

1438
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:26,810
更重要的是 她有远见
But more importantly, she has a vision.

1439
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,440
她会带领基诺维亚向前发展 如果议员们够精明
One that will take Genovia forward,  and if the parliament were astute, 

1440
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,310
他们就应该任命她为女王
they would name her queen.

1441
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:37,340
听她的 她会带领我们进入21世纪
Listen to her. She'll lead us into the 21 st century.

别走开 先生! 你身负基诺维亚的重任 先生
Don't you walk away from me, sir! You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.

1446
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,610
他 他...很悲伤
He's, uh... he is very distressed.

1447

01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:17,690
尼古拉斯 我不能让你把这一切都给那个女孩
Nicholas, I cannot have you giving all, all this up just for a girl.

1452
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,320
-现在 我们还可以...  -够了 叔叔
-Now, look, we can still...  -Enough, Uncle.

01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,730
结束了
We're finished.

1454
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,730
这发生了什么?
What is happening here?

1455
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:29,370
谁将会得到王位? 范・筹肯?
Who's next in line for the throne? The Von Trokens?

1456
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,740
我们同意
We accept.

1457

我决定要废除婚姻法
I move to abolish the marriage law, 

1463
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:53,890
对现在和将来的基诺维亚女王都有效
