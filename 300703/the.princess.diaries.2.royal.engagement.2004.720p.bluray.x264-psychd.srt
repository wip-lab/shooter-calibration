1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,780
尽管你们的毕业证书相当管用 记住：
Although your diplomas are equally specific, remember:

2
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,920
你们是独自去闯世界
you are all going out into the world as individuals.

6
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,750
加油 加油 加油
Go, go, go.

10
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,510
是我 全新的大学公主毕业生
it's me. Brand-new college graduate-slash-princess.

16
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,220
一切都会好的 因为他们希望能有一个孩子
It must be going well, because they are now expecting a baby.

17
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
莉莉还是老样子 一如既往的制造麻烦
Lilly's remained the same, as she continues to cause turmoil,

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,840
自从他和他的乐队全国巡回演出后 我们现在只是朋友
we're just friends now, as he went off to tour the country with his band.

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,650
看看窗外 欢迎回到基诺维亚
Look out the window, and welcome back to Genovia.

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,700
哦 是的 我美丽的基诺维亚
Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia.

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,140
当然 能够回来我很激动 但是也有一点紧张
Of course, I'm completely excited to be going back, but I'm also a bit nervous.

26
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,200
基诺维亚一号已经着陆
Genovia One has landed.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,300
奶奶克拉丽斯今年年底将从女皇的位置退下来
Grandma Clarisse will step down by the end of this year as queen,

32
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,790
我知道我在学校里学的是外交和政治 但是...
I know I studied diplomacy and political science at school, but...

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,970
但是奶奶会教我 在她认为我准备好了的时候会让我接任
But Grandma's going to help me, and I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready.

36
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,100
在这期间 我会住在一个像童话般漂亮的宫殿里
In the meantime, I'm going to live in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale,

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,910
那样会很恐怖或是什么的吗?
Is that scary or what?

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,440
好了 或许胖路易会帮助我的
Well, maybe Fat Louie can give me some help.

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,090
公主 欢迎回家
Welcome home, Princess.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,870
在我的童话里 有件沮丧的事情就是我从未恋爱过
The one downer in my fairy tale is I've never been in love.

47
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,650
不管怎么样 今晚是我21岁的生日晚会
However, this evening is my 21st-birthday party,

49
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,820
我必须同基诺维亚所有符合条件的单身汉跳舞
I have to dance with all the eligible bachelors in Genovia.

50
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,620
或许今晚我能遇见我的白马王子
So maybe I'll meet my Prince Charming tonight.

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,860
女皇要来了
The queen is coming.

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,740
她要有一个双门的入口
She'll have a double-door entrance.

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,340
她已经到大厅了
She's in the foyer.

57
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,590
真漂亮
Beautiful.

58
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,260
但是你迟到了 殿下
But you're late, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
当然
Of course.

63
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,290
你们好 朋友们
Greetings, good friends.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,760
很高兴今晚你们能来这里
I am delighted to welcome you here this evening.

66
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,540
好的
good.

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,120
你们很多人应该记得鲁柏特国王和我的 孙女米娅公主
Many of you will remember King Rupert's and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

68
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,450
鲁柏特国王 愿他长眠
King Rupert. May he rest in peace.

74
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,790
敬米娅公主
To Princess Mia.

75
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,890
敬米娅公主
To Princess Mia.

78
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,240
哦 我不会说希腊语
 I don't speak Greek.

79
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,810
你显然也不会说英语
And you obviously don't speak English.

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,860
一 二 三 一 二 三
One, two, three. One, two, three.

81
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,650
一 二 三 一 二 三
One, two, three. One, two, three.

83
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,820
对不起
Sorry.

87
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,250
我想死你了
I've missed you.

92
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,470
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

93
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,230
我还活着 殿下
I'll survive, Your Highness.

94
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,640
都是我脚的错 对不起
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.

95
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,200
你确认你不想换保险执照和保险证吗?
Are you sure you don't want to exchange licenses and proof of insurance?

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,610
不 不 这些鞋子只是有点大
No, no. These shoes were a little big anyway.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,980
慢慢的膨胀会使它们更舒服的
The swelling should help them fit better.

98
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,920
嘿 看这个男的
Hey, get a load of this guy.

99
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,390
摇动 摇动
Shimmy shimmy.

106
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,340
可以吗?
May l?

108
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,890
米娅 我喜欢别人叫我米娅
Mia. I like to be called Mia.

109
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,190
那么你是?
And you are?

111
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,530
我很高兴我的笨拙没有影响到你的舞步
I'm very glad to see that my clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,230
对不起 我刚才踩到你的脚了
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.

113
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,570
你可以任何时候踩它
You can step on my foot anytime.

114
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,410
轮到雅克王子了
It is Prince Jacques' turn.

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,050
殿下
Your Highness.

118
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,760
他是一个早熟的王子
He's a very precocious prince.

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,500
他擦了须后水 好让别人认为他很成熟
He wears aftershave to make people think that he's older.

120
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,010
可以和你耳语几句吗?
May I blow in your ear?

121
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,670
你够得着吗?
Can you reach it?

122
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,980
公主 你应该会见一些国会的人
Princess, there's someone from parliament you should meet.

123
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,450
夏洛特 这里有多少国会的人?
Charlotte, how many members of parliament are there?

124
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,680
只剩下两个 殿下
Only two left, Your Highness.

126
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,720
哦 殿下 对不起 这只是一次意外
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me, I am so sorry. It was only an accident.

127
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,560
没事 没事 没有受伤 没有弄脏 没有撞到
It's fine, it's fine. No harm, no foul, no bruise.

128
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,660
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

129
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,500
你应该注意些 高贵的殿下
You should be more careful, Your Royal Highness.

130
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,600
有人可能会把这个拿走的
Somebody might try to take that away from you.

131
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,470
哦 希望不会 不过还是要谢谢你的帮助
Oh, I hope not. But thank you so much for all your help.

135
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,190
嘿 怎么样了?
Hi. How's it going?

147
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,460
好了 去干你们的事吧
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.

148
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,500
殿下一个小时内会在王宫见您
Her Majesty will meet you in one hour at the throne room.

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,340
我能去看看皇宫的其他地方吗?
can I explore the palace a little bit?

153
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,960
当然
Of course.

163
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,270
的确 我们都认识到了 子爵
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.

166
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,580
我指的不是米娅公主
It was not Princess Mia to whom I was referring.

169
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,450
你好？
Hello?

172
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,810
好极了
Nice.

173
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,140
有人吗?
Hello?

178
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
什么?
What?

179
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,220
我的侄子 德弗里奥克斯亲王
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

180
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,780
请你再说一遍？
I beg your pardon?

181
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,820
我侄子的母亲是我夫人的姐姐
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

182
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,630
因此殿下 我很高兴的说 我的侄子准备接替他的位置
Therefore, Your Majesty, I am pleased to say that my nephew is ready to take his place

185
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,180
闭嘴
Shut up.

186
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,770
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,920
但是米娅公主不是王室的第一继承人吗?
But isn't Princess Mia first in line to ascend the throne?

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,290
并不是这样的
Not yet.

194
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,500
我们从没有执行过那样的法律
We have never enforced that law.

195
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,510
一个男人就不必在当上国王之前结婚了
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

196
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,340
我的意思是 这是21世纪了 看在上帝的份上
I mean, this is the 21 st century, for heaven's sake.

197
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,610
我的孙女应该拥有和其他男人同样的权力
My granddaughter should be given the same rights as any man.

198
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,210
对!
Yeah!

199
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,220
基诺维亚不应该要女皇 以免她会陷进婚姻的束缚中
Genovia shall have no queen lest she be bound in matrimony.

200
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,690
帕利莫阁下?
Lord Palimore?

201
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,330
那是过去300年的基诺维亚法律
That is the law of Genovia for the last 300 years.

202
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,860
米娅公主没有资格统治 因为她没有结婚
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule because she is unmarried.

203
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,370
请宽恕我 殿下
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

211
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,330
什么? 不行
What? No.

214
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,510
60天?
60 days?

215
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,310
30天
30 days.

216
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,850
国会怎么能让我在30天内就谈恋爱? 这就像...
How could parliament expect me to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

218
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,350
不行
No.

220
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,220
包办婚姻是我唯一的选择
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

221
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,500
什么人能够同意这种包办婚姻的呢?
What kind of person agrees to an arranged marriage?

222
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
你同意了这个包办婚姻
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

224
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,010
它肯定会很壮观
And it turned out quite splendidly.

226
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,610
我肯定 奶奶 但是
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

227
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,920
我梦想爱情 但不沉迷于此
I dream of love, not fondness.

229
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,270
这不公平
This is so unfair.

230
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,140
阿米莉娅
Amelia.

231
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,580
勇气不是逃避恐惧
Courage is not the absence of fear,

236
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,630
我坚信 作为一个统治者 我能有一些机会做一些改变
I'm sure I want my chance to make a difference as a ruler.

237
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,140
这就像一个真正的女皇在说话
Spoken like a true queen.

238
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,150
哦 我的孩子 一个拥有基诺维亚血统的孩子
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

239
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,190
你应该成为我们的国王
You should be our king.

240
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,550
我同意
I agree.

241
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,290
但是 我们怎么才可以做到呢?
But how can we make it happen?

242
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,290
给我一枝镖
Give me one of your arrows.

243
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,930
我给你表演个从一个意大利老哲学家那学来的把戏
I'm going to show you a trick that I learned from an old ltalian philosopher.

245
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,640
我能让这只镖每次都击中靶心
I can make this dart hit the bull's-eye every time.

246
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,720
是的 但那是在作弊
Yes, but that is cheating.

247
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,760
你说对了
You've got it.

249
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,760
是的 殿下
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,470
我知道莱昂内尔是首相的侄子
I know Lionel is the prime minister's nephew

252
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,670
他整个夏天一直在做实习医师
and he's interning for the summer

260
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,620
我不知道你是否见过我们的女管家考特太太
I don't know if you've met Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

262
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,890
我正在调查奥莉维亚背景
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

264
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,100
这个房间的每个人都可以优先排除
Everybody in this room has high-priority clearance.

265
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,610
当然 当然
Of course, of course.

267
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,200
我很愿意为你挡一颗子弹
I would gladly take a bullet for you.

268
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,040
哦 真勇敢
Oh, how brave.

269
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,140
很多实习医师都不愿帮我拿茶
Most interns don't even want to fetch me my tea.

270
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,190
车已经备好了 女士
The limousine is at the gates, madam.

271
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,020
子爵没有来 只来了他的侄子
The viscount is not staying, just the nephew.

272
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,500
乔瑟夫 我希望你能够保护他 并且时刻盯住他
Joseph, I want you to protect him and keep your eye on him at all times.

274
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,870
这样欢迎子爵和他的侄子可以吗?
So is this all right to welcome the viscount and his nephew?

275
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,770
非常合适 非常漂亮
Very appropriate. And pretty.

276
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,800
我不敢相信国会邀请了这个男的
I can't believe parliament invited the guy

278
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,150
哦 不 国会并没有邀请他
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

279
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,980
是我邀请的
I did.

280
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,350
什么...
What...

281
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,980
我建议把他挂在我们的后花园
I offered to have him hung by his toes in our courtyard.

285
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,340
在乘客老死之前 你应该打开门
You just have to open the door before the passenger dies of old age.

287
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,440
我不想对这个家伙太好 你知道吗?
I just so don't want to be nice to this guy, you know?

289

女王很少唱卡拉OK的

嗯 我可能是在电脑上改变了一点旋律

01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,450
但是我不知道怎么做这种事
But I don't know how to do this sort of thing.

997

有些人看起来没有缺点

而且她真心在乎基诺维亚
And she really cares about Genovia.

1021
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,850

Maybe...

1022
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,890
嗯 如果让她来治理这个国家也许会不错
Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if she ran the country.

1023
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,510
你疯了么?
Are you mad?

1027
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,400
毕竟我们付出了努力 就这样无为而终?
After all the effort that we have put in,  to end up with nothing?

1029
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,240

不 叔叔 我要问的是...

我耗尽精力要让你当上国王

米娅
Mia.

1087
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,710
在我走之前我能再见你一面么?
Could I see you one more time before I go?

1088
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,940
尼古拉斯 我像一只鹰一样被监视着
Nicholas, I'm watched like a hawk.

1089
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,250
公主 公主
Princess, Princess.

嗯 没什么 我只是应该看护着你

我得检查一下乐队挑选的如何了

不 约瑟夫 你必须知道我要说什么
No, Joseph. You had to know what I was going to say.

1105
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,620
米娅现在比以前任何时候都更需要我
Mia needs me now more than ever before.

1108
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,690
你从来就不只是我的女王 克拉丽斯
You were never just my queen, Clarisse.

1109
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:55,890
你是我想共度一生的人
You were the someone that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

1110
01:12:55,970 --> 01:13:02,340
但是 如果你希望我首先把你当成我的女王...
But, if you prefer that I see you first and foremost as my queen...

你的床铺好了 殿下

不要再行屈膝礼了
No more curtsy.

1118
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,440

We're going to supper.

1119
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,680
谢谢
Thank you.

1124
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,920
尼古拉斯
Nicholas.

1125
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,260
尼古拉斯 你在干什么?
Nicholas, what are you doing?

1126
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:09,330
莴苣姑娘 莴苣姑娘 你的头发如此美丽

从窗户出来 顺着藤爬下来
Come out your window,  climb down the vine.

1130
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,480

01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,020
他想让我从藤上爬下去
He wants me to climb down the vine.

1137
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,560
我一直喜欢在阴影中的男人

进来 进来 我正想出去

我的脚卡住了
My foot is stuck.

1142
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,270

晨钟响了 晨钟响了

我们在派对上没有看到真是可惜啊

1159
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,910
没有人知道你心里想什么
No one knows what's in your heart.

1162
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,630
我学校里有考试的时候 我就装作生病

01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:53,680
不 米娅 我根本不知道那个男的是谁

1194
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,520
米娅 我和这件事根本无关 我发誓

01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:23,290
我知道有点早 但是我一直在想

1201
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,690
最近事情的确压力很大
Things have been so pressured lately.

1203
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,690
莉莉?
Lilly?

1204

早安 殿下
Good morning, Your Majesty.

1206
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,430
米娅
Mia.

1216
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,570
现在对米娅公主来说相当于从煎锅 出来又跳进了火里
It's out of the frying pan and into the fire for Princess Mia, 

1218
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,360
我应该告诉她应该怎么做她的鸡蛋...
I'd like to tell her what she can do with her eggs...

安德鲁 等一下 我向你发誓什么也没有发生

我还是觉得我们的婚姻是非常好的
I still think this marriage is a good idea.

1232
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:16,520
米娅
Mia.

1233
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,340
女王不会赞成监视的
The queen would not approve of spying.

1234
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:30,780
啊
Ah.

1235
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,720

1245
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,910
米娅
Mia.

1246

01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:29,870
一个绅士从不收回他的话

1250
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,470

殿下 我们迟到了很多

1257
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,890
奶奶说女王从来不迟到 只是其他人来早了
Grandma says the queen is never late,  everyone else is simply early.

1262
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,840
看 这就是我所说的壁橱
Now, this is what I call a closet.

1271
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:05,590
结婚就是做回你自己 只不过是和其他人一起
Being married is about being yourself,  only with someone else.

1272
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,400
