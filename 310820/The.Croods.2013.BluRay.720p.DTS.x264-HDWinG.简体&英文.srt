12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,500
每每旭日东升
With every sun comes a new day.

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,150
都是崭新的开始
A new beginning.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,750
总是期冀今日之美远胜昨日
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,160
但不属于我   我叫小伊
But not for me. My name's Eep.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,380
这是我的家人  克鲁德一家
And this is my family. The Croods.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,930
我们整日在洞穴中度日 藏于黑暗
Most days we spend in our cave,in the dark.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,770
日复一日  年复一年
Night after night, day after day.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,030
难得出洞  还得在残酷的大自然里 拼命找食物
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,430
我还得拼命保护家人
And I struggled to survive my family.

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,180
曾经有很多邻居
There used to be neighbors.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,820
高茨一家  被猛犸象踩扁了
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,700
霍克一家  被沙蛇吞了
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

32
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,850
还有克鲁德一家  就是我们
And the Croods... That's us.

33
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,250
我们活下来了  全靠我老爸
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,480
新鲜事物都很危险  好奇心也很危险
Anything new is bad. Curiosity is bad.

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,640
夜晚出门更是危险
Going out at night is bad.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,910
总而言之  有趣的事情都危险
Basically, anything fun is bad.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,490
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,860
这故事讲的是这一切如何瞬间改变
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,950
因为我们还不知道我们的世界面临末日
Because what we didn't know was that our world was about to come to an end.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,760
你应该等我信号的  小伊
You're supposed to wait for my signal, Eep.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,970
小伊
Eep.

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,320
小伊  拜托下来好吗
Eep, will you come down here?

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,520
没事了  桑克  出来吧
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,440
可如果你不发信号  我怎么知道你是我老爸？
But if you don't give me the signal, how do I know you're my dad?

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
信号不是为了验明我的正身
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,690
是为了证明我还没被野兽吃掉
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,170
那为何信号是野兽叫啊？
Then why is the signal an animal noise?

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,270
那样不会产生歧义吗
doesn't that just confuse things?

64
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,170
我还在等信号
I'm still waiting for the signal.

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
妈妈  准备出发！
Mom, we're ready to leave!

66
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,120
妈妈？
Mom?

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,460
发挥出洞穴人应有的水平来！
I want to see some real caveman action out there!

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,360
吃早餐啦
Yay breakfast.

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,570
快点  桑克
Come on, Thunk.

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,850
谢谢啦
Thanks.

91
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,530
老爸  能开饭了吗？
 Dad, can we eat now?

92
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,310
等回到家再说吧
Just wait til we get home.

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,290
小伊  启动刹车！
Eep, put on the brakes!

94
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,320
小伊
Eep!

95
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,320
谁想吃饭
Who's hungry?

96
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,830
干得好  老爸
Good one, Dad.

97
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,650
给你  桑克  尽情喝吧
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

99
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,550
没事  我上周吃过了
That's all right. I ate last week.

102
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,150
赶紧  赶紧
Come on, come on.

104
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,740
满月之夜  该洗澡了
The moon is full. Bath night.

106
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,790
我可不想被洗掉保护皮
I don't want to lose my protective layer.

107
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,380
妈妈  你身上都长蚂蚁了
Mom, you've got ants.

111
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,330
她怎么会不喜欢洞穴  多温馨啊
How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.

112
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,670
太黑了点  是吧？
It is a little dark, right?

113
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,230
也没那么黑
It's not that dark.

114
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,560
小伊！
Eep!

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,290
快来  我要关门了
Come on, I gotta close the cave.

116
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,340
小伊！
Eep!

117
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,380
来了 ！ 来了！
Okay! Okay!

118
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,860
快回来
Come on.

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,130
小伊 ！ 下来！
Eep! Come down!

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,540
恐惧让我们生存  小伊
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.

128
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,370
这一切有何意义呢？
What's the point of all this?

131
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,370
没人说生存是件趣事
No one said survival is fun.

132
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,750
一切都了无生趣
Nothing is fun.

137
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,270
她在思索 需要自己的空间
She's working through some things and needs some space.

140
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,810
看吧？  她听着呢
See? She's listening.

141
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,820
要想生存  她就必须遵守规矩
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.

144
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,210
好的  能借用一下吗？  多谢
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

146
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,550
我都多少年没玩过那玩具了
I haven't played with that thing in years.

148
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,830
很久以前  小熊还活着
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.

149
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,640
她能活着  因为她听从老爸的话
She was alive because she listened to her father

151
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,710
所以她很快乐
So she was happy.

164
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,220
我明白  老爸  我永远不会去尝鲜
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.

168
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,850
我和你一样  是个人
I'm person, like you.

170
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,480
好吧  好吧  喂 喂 喂
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey,

173
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,190
安静 ！ 我不应该出门的
Quiet! I am not supposed to be out here.

176
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,780
哇  你可真是强壮
Wow, you're really strong.

180
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,010
加油  加油
Come on, come on

181
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,920
它听你的命令吗？
It does what you tell it?

184
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,120
你好啊  火儿
Hi, Fire.

185
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,440
它没有生命
It's not alive.

195
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,900
我同意  虎妞  我们必须马上离开
I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

196
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,330
我都不认识你
I don't even know you.

204
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,560
首先  大地会颤抖  然后裂开
First, the ground is gonna shake. Then it breaks open.

205
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,020
万物跌入其中
Everything falls in.

206
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,010
烈火  熔岩  我不想太夸张  但是...
Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

207
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,620
相信我  我们脚下的一切
Believe me, everything we're standing on,

208
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,750
所有的一切  都会毁灭
all this right here, will be gone.

209
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,700
我们必须去高地  我知道有座山
We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain,

211
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,040
跟我来吧
Come with me.

213
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,820
这个
Here.

214
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,980
如果你能活下来  呼叫我
If you survive, call me.

215
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,650
谢谢
Thank you.

220
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,120
你从不让我解释
You never let me talk.

221
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,750
你被关禁闭了
You're grounded.

224
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,310
我现在很生气  不想和她说话
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.

226
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,840
我找到了一样新东西
I found something new.

228
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,900
等等
Wait.

229
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,070
小伊  待在家庭作战队形里
Eep, stay inside the family kill circle.

234
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,140
奇怪  一般都反过来才对
Strange. Usually it's the reverse.

237
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,240
他是个男孩  好吗 ？ 我现在就叫他来
There was a boy. okay? I'm gonna call him.

238
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,170
你们有毛病吗？
What is wrong with you?

242
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,560
我们现在就回洞穴
We're going back to the cave

244
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,220
什么？
What?

245
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,700
你不能关我一辈子！
You can't keep me inside forever!

246
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,210
他说过会这样的
He said this would happen.

247
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,420
快回洞穴
Get to the cave.

248
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,610
快跑！
Go!

249
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,220
小心！
Look out!

250
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
停！
Stop!

252
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,180
阿瓜  洞穴没了
Grug, the cave. It's gone.

253
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,980
不
No.

254
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,010
你们真该来看看
You really need to see this.

257
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,690
那男孩还说了什么
What else did that boy say?

260
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,230
六个
Six.

262
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,040
在下面  低一点的地方
Down. In a lower place.

263
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,730
有一点可以确定  我们回不去了
One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came.

264
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,290
仙蒂？  那是什么？
Sandy? What is it?

266
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,860
我们不能像这样暴露在外面
We can't be out in the open like this.

267
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,410
我们要找个洞穴
We need a cave.

268
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,710
踩着我的脚印走
Now step where I step.

269
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,430
好的  保持安静
Okay. Stay quiet.

270
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,830
希望还没有大家伙注意到我们
Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet.

271
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,100
等等！  好了
Wait! Okay.

272
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,120
等等！  好了
Wait! Okay.

273
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,810
等等！
Wait!

274
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,190
等等！
Wait!

275
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
好了  等等
Okay. Wait.

276
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,160
等等
Wait.

281
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,710
等等！
Wait!

283
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,490
好的  爸爸  拿下它们
All right, Dad, go get them.

286
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,570
爸爸  我知道了
Dad, I got this.

291
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,850
快点！
Move!


297
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,590
六个
Six.

300
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,650
他怕黑
He's scared of the dark

301
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,700
等一下  我们也怕黑
Wait, we're scared of the dark

303
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,340
小伊
Eep

304
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,310
小伊
Eep

311
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,970
好的  闭上眼
All right. Close your eyes.

312
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,480
我来取他们性命
I'm going to have to take their lives.

313
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,430
不  没用的  他们是我的家人
No, it won't help. They're my family.

314
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,400
什么？
What?

323
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,220
我们现在就坐在这儿等太阳出来
Now we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.

324
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,630
明天我们去找一个新的洞穴
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave

326
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,750
很有趣吧  小伊？
Isn't this fun, Eep?

327
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,350
小伊  别碰他！
Eep, don't touch him!

328
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,850
鬼知道他从哪冒出来的
Goodness knows where he's been.

329
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,730
爸爸  仙蒂在伤害火！
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire!

338
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,810
没错  但我不会让他得逞的
Yeah. But I won't let him.

339
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,360
等一下  儿子  回来！
Hold on, son, come back!

340
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,070
它停不下来  别碰我！
It won't stop. Stop touching me!

341
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,550
滚开！
Get out!

342
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,810
尽情吃吧  宝宝们！
Eat up, babies!

343
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,360
去死！
Die!

344
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,540
我赢了！
I win!

345
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,290
熟了之后你就不觉得他们吓人了
They're not so scary once you get to know them.

346
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,520
你们到底是什么人？
Who are you people?

347
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,490
真抱歉  我们是克鲁德一家！
Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croods!

348
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,040
你呢？
And you are?

350
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,810
跟魔术一样！
Looks like magic!

351
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,900
闻起来好美味
And smells like food.

352
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,540
别吃  这是新事物
Don't eat it, it's new.

353
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,650
还活着！
Still alive!

354
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,320
来吧  继续吃！
Come on, keep eating!

355
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,000
盖伊在哪？
where's Guy?

359
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,300
不  这只是末日的前兆
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

361
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,250
小伊  把他放下
Eep. Drop it.

362
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,770
我们不能让他跑了！
We can't let him go!

365
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,110
要是那群鸟又来了怎么办？
What if the birds come back?

366
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,080
我们需要他的火  笨蛋
We need his fire, dummy!

367
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,780
好吧  你就待到我们找到洞穴为止
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.

369
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,240
你们想留下就留下  但是放我走
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

370
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,960
我还有梦想  有使命
I've got a dream, a mission,

371
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,460
有活下去的理由！
a reason to live!

373
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,550
我有个主意  我们去那座山上吧
I've got an idea. Let's go to that Mountain.

375
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,330
山上也有洞穴
There are caves on that Mountain.

376
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,590
你去过了？
Have you been there?

377
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,020
那是座山
It's a mountain.

380
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,410
妈妈  你听见没？
Mom, did you hear that?

381
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,470
我可以有自己的树枝了！
I can get my own stick!

383
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,330
洞穴跟树枝  好多树枝呢  走吧
Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go.

385
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,510
那玩意真奇怪
That thing is weird.

386
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,420
不 不 不  没事  仙蒂
No. No. No. It's okay, Sandy.

391
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,790
我们可从来没走过这么远
We've never really walked that far.

392
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,800
我的脚可受不了
I don't think my feet can do that.

393
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,640
我可活不到走到的那一天
I'll never live long enough to get there.

400
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,860
一家人的感情会更好
We'll become closer as a family.

407
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,230
别推我  不然我拔掉你舌头！
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!

411
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,450
仙蒂  快把那东西吐出来
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

420
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,530
我不要做个饿死鬼
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

421
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
阿瓜  我们都很累了
Grug, we're all pretty tired.

423
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,630
我先吃点零食
I'm grabbing a snack.

425
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,260
他是我的宠物
he's a pet.

427
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,710
我们管那种东西叫小孩
We call those children.

428
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,610
人不应该养宠物
No man should have a pet.

431
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,040
不是它  是它！
Not that. That!

432
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,120
食物能解决任何问题
Food fixes everything.

433
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
好了  进入狩猎状态
All right, show me your hunting face.

434
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,770
不是你！  你还在禁闭中
Not you! You're still grounded.

435
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,990
来吧  桑克
Come on, Thunk.

436
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,550
我的脚好痛
My feet hurt.

439
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,760
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

440
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,890
坚持住  桑克  我来了
Hang on, Thunk. I'm coming.

443
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,800
你离我远点！
You stay away from me!

444
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,210
不  说真的  他们在干嘛？
No, seriously, what are they doing?

447
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,540
来  谁想要吃蝎子
There. Who is hungry for scorpion?

448
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,530
那只鸟和那颗蛋怎么了？
What happened to the egg and the bird?

457
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,520
我还要！
I need more!

460
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,700
你身上没肉
You're too skinny.

464
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,980
快点！  把棍子塞进她嘴里！
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

465
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,070
稳住她  用石头
Hold her still. Use a rock.

468
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,220
我只是想找吃的！
I just want something to eat!

470
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,110
拜托 ！ 我会让你帮我狩猎
Please! I'll let you help me hunt.

471
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,970
真的吗？
Really?

472
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,460
别管我了！
Don't wait on me!

474
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,030
行了
Okay.

477
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,310
你一个人过多久了？
How long have you been alone?

478
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,820
那我们要做什么？
So what do we do?

479
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,410
你的演技如何？
How's your acting?

480
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,820
你很擅长这个啊
You're good at this.

481
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,840
不对  抱歉  不是  就这样
No, Sorry. No. Okay.

482
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,990
不好意思
Excuse me.

483
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,850
那是我的手臂！  是...
That's my arm! That's...

486
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,130
是  我发现了！
Yeah, I noticed!

487
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,890
小伊去哪儿了？
Where's Eep?

488
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,090
她好厉害
She's awesome.

489
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,460
小伊！
Eep!

490
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,080
老爸  别！
Dad, no!

491
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,740
真是一顿饕餮大餐！
It's an avalanche of flavor!

496
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
我们从来都没弄到过那么多食物
We never have that much food.

497
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,350
阿瓜  来讲个故事吧？
Grug, how about a story?

499
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,280
太好了  快给我们讲故事吧！
Yeah,Tell us a story!

508
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,760
但是当大家都睡着了以后 她还是跑出去了
But while everyone was asleep,she went out anyway.

511
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,850
她前脚刚走  她家的山洞就被毁了
And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed

512
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,700
全家人只得走上这长长的恼人旅程
and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk,

516
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:39,990
讲完了
The end.

519
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,750
我的故事是不会就这样潦草结束的
My stories never end like that.

520
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,990
太好了！  一晚上俩故事！
Yes! Two stories in one night!

521
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,030
好吧  但没有阿瓜的那么精彩
Okay, but it won't be as good as Grug's.

522
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,170
很久以前  有只美丽的老虎
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.

523
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,290
她和家人住在一个山洞里
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.

543
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,980
在那里  天空中的太阳多得数不清
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.

544
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,420
那会很明亮啊
It would be so bright.

545
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,260
那里不像今天亦或昨天
A place not like today, or yesterday.

546
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,370
那里的一切都更美好
A place where things are better.

547
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,590
明天又不是个地方
Tomorrow isn't a place.

548
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,790
它是...是...是...
It's... It's... It's...

551
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,510
那就是我要去的地方
That's where I'm going.

552
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,550
行了  该去睡觉了
Well, we are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

561
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,610
你有时间吗？
Do you have a minute?

562
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,850
那只老虎是怎么飞的？
How did the tiger fly?

564
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,810
那样我才有激情
I'm funny that way.

565
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,440
看我的吧
Leave this to me.

566
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,970
桑克  你脸上有只蜘蛛
Thunk, you have a spider on your face.

567
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,390
他跑掉了！
He's loose!

574
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,550
回来  马上给我回来！
Get back here, get back here now!

575
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,690
我们的救星跑掉了
there goes our chance for survival.

577
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,440
好吧！
Okay!

582
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,430
我可以帮忙
I can help you,

586
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,400
现在把它踢走
Now kick it away.

590
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,230
现在要怎样？
Now what?

592
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,480
好了  现在可以看了
Okay, now you can look.

595
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,120
那好
Okay.

599
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,860
行了  她起来了
Okay, she's up.

600
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,810
我们都没事  没事了
We're good. I'm good.

602
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,770
这个叫做大脑
I'm calling it a brain.

604
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,760
爸  我没有大脑
Dad, I don't have a brain.

605
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,750
就算没有大脑  我们也生活得很好
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.

606
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,770
原始人不需要大脑
Cavemen don't need brains.

609
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,860
现在  让我们朝那座山迈进吧
Now let's get to that Mountain.

611
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,700
乖乖鱼  别吃我的脚脚
Good fish, don't eat my feet.

612
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,430
老虎到底是怎么飞的?
how did the tiger fly?

613
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,080
她跳上了太阳
She jumped on the sun,

617
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,520
老爸再见
Bye, Dad.

619
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,600
我们很少出门的
We don't get out much.

620
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,360
小伊  这个看着不安全
Eep, looks dangerous.

621
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,080
老爸  你看什么都危险
Dad, you say that about everything.

627
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,120
这故事很有趣!
That's a funny story!

628
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,520
这不是故事  是笑话
It's not a story, it's a joke.

629
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,000
笑话是什么?
What's a joke?

634
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,110
行了 行了  够了
Okay. Okay. That's enough.

638
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,670
等下  你是说我们要分头行动吗?
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

639
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,550
这样就能同时尝试多条路径了
We can try more paths at once.

640
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,050
这是最快捷有效的方式
It's the fastest way through.

641
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,180
克鲁德一家永远不分离
The Croods stick together.

642
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,650
你的方法不安全
Your way isn't safe.

645
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,120
保护你们的安全是我的责任
It's my job to keep you safe.

651
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,420
我们没事  阿瓜  
We're okay, Grug!

652
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,700
老爸  我有点害怕
Dad, I'm freaking out a little bit.

653
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,730
告诉我该怎么做
Just tell me what to do.

655
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,410
原地不动!  我会找到你的
Stay where you are! I'll find you.

656
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:48,190
不!  太慢了
No! Too slow.

657
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,190
所有人都往前走  我们会走出去的
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.

658
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,170
老爸?
Dad?

659
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,110
是的  好吧
Yeah. Okay.

660
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,160
记住  千万不要害怕
Remember, never not be afraid.

661
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,720
你可以的!
You can do this!

663
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,950
我要晕过去了
I'm gonna pass out.

666
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,550
你掉东西了
You dropped these.

667
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,240
跟我走
Come with me.

671
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,140
阿瓜
Grug?

672
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,680
我去接他
I'll go get him.

676
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,590
就叫你道格拉斯吧
I'm going to call you Douglas.

677
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,170
你能做动作吗?
Can you do tricks?

678
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,150
翻身
Roll over.

679
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,770
来  道格拉斯  翻身
Come on, Douglas. Roll over.

680
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,890
好狗狗  道格拉斯!
Good boy, Douglas!

683
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,930
在当时算是件丑闻
It was quite a scandal.

684
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,290
我们喂对方吃浆果  一起跳舞
We fed each other berries. We danced.

685
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,950
然后我爸用石头把他捶成肉泥
Then my father smashed him with a rock,

688
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,440
阿瓜  他们没事
Grug, they're okay.

691
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,950
那还真是感谢  
Well, thank you,

692
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,900
谢谢你告诉我关于盖伊的有趣近况
thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.

693
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,100
好了  我要上去了
Okay. I'm gonna go up.

01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,240
我知道你带着我们走挺麻烦的  但是...
I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but...

701
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,220
这些天是他们生命中最多彩的日子
they had the best day in their lives.

702
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,710
谢谢你
Thank you.

703
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,200
我带你们看样东西
I wanna show you something.

704
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,210
数都数不清的太阳
More suns in the sky than you can count.

705
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:13,490
每一颗横跨天空的星星都会在那里休息
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.

707
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,300
我要跟盖伊一起走  
I'm going with Guy.

708
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,170
不  不要带走我的女儿
No, not my little girl.

709
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,950
跟我们一起走吧
Come with us.

710
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,570
我不能扔下阿瓜
I can't go without Grug.

713
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,460
阿瓜根本不知道怎么保护我们
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

714
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,690
他压根就没主意
In fact, he has no ideas at all.

727
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,120
你头上那是什么?
What's that on your head?

728
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,360
我看叫孤注一掷
It's called desperation.

735
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,270
绘画已经过时了
Painting is a thing of the past.

739
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,270
阳光不再刺眼啦
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

740
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,980
你哪来的这些好主意?
Where do you get these great ideas?

744
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,290
阿瓜  该出发了
Grug, we have to keep moving.

749
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,260
我懂的  太烂了
I know. It's bad.

750
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,550
我差点儿就要心疼他了
I almost feel sorry for him.

752
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,760
阿瓜  你想干吗
What are you trying to do, Grug?

755
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,350
也许她就不会想跟盖伊走了
Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.

757
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,840
我还以为这样能干掉你老妈  所以...
And I also thought it would kill your mother, so...

758
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,720
你懂的  双赢
you know, win-win.

759
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,720
我们到了！
We're here!

762
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,560
不！
No!

764
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,150
我们要乘着太阳和盖伊一起去明天
We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.

767
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,590
别再为我们操心了
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

769
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,390
规矩在这儿不好使了！
The rules don't work out here!

771
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,560
那不是活着  那只是...
That wasn't living, that was just...

773
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,240
乌格  大家听着  你们得听我讲!
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me!

774
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,730
要是听了你的  我们早就死了!
We'd be dead now if we'd listened to you!

775
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,820
我们必须跟着盖伊走
We have to follow Guy now.

778
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:09,620
世界就要崩塌了
Everything is collapsing.

779
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,890
你失去理智的话会适得其反的
You are being irrational and counterproductive.

783
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,270
你变了  记得吗?
You changed, remember?

789
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,590
别动了
You have to stop.

791
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,610
阿瓜  别动!
Grug, stop!

792
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:12,800
没人能挣脱焦油  相信我
No one gets out of this. Believe me.

793
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:14,910
我知道
I know.

795
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,530
对不起
Sorry.

796
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,510
当时我还很小
I was little when it happened.

801
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,480
不  他像你
No. She's like you.

802
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,110
她爱你  却总是忘记说出口
She loves you but always forgets to say it,

803
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,280
就像你也总是忘记向她表露心声
just like you forget to tell her.

804
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:11,350
也许因为我总是忙着保护他们
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.

805
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,200
我理解  这是父亲的责任
It's okay. That's what dads do.

806
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,640
没错  但是我们要先离开这里
That's right, and we can't do that from here.

807
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,650
我们需要你的主意
We need one of your ideas.

808
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,950
来吧  你行的
Come on, you can do it.

818
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:32,290
可能咱们的人偶不够惊恐
I don't think out puppet looks scared enough.

819
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,830
惊恐?  我给你来个惊恐的!
Scared? I'll show you scared!

821
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,430
抓紧了!
Hold on!

824
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,780
我们没事!
We're okay!

826
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,990
阿瓜  听你的
Grug, your call.

827
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,420
带我们去明天吧
Take us to Tomorrow.

828
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:04,250
快点!  加油!  我们要到了!
Hurry! Come on! We're gonna make it!

831
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:38,560
快跑!
Run!

832
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,170
我...我不明白
I ... I don't understand.

833
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:12,040
太阳就在这儿!  刚刚还在这儿呀!
The sun was right here! It was right here!

834
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,520
快回到洞里去!  快
We have to go back to the cave! Hurry.

837
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,680
大家抓住我的手!  桑克
Everybody hold my hand! Thunk,

840
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,000
阿瓜  在这里会死的
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

841
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,690
阿瓜  听我说!  我们得回到洞里
Grug, listen to me! We have to get back to that cave.

842
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,260
不要黑暗  不再躲藏
No more dark. No more hiding.

843
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,020
不要再进洞穴了
No more caves.

844
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,210
这一切都是为了什么?
What's the point of all this?

845
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,700
追逐光明
To follow the light.

846
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,110
我无法改变自己  我也没有主意
I can't change, I don't have ideas,

847
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,470
但是我有蛮力
but I have my strength.

849
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:42,020
不!  我们对那边一无所知!
No! We don't know what's over there!

850
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,240
那边也许什么都没有  太冒险了!
Maybe nothing. It's too risky!

851
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,740
这是个机会
It's a chance.

852
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,770
我愿意试试
I'll take that chance.

853
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:05,990
从我一见到你  就想把你扔出去
You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.

855
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,300
他成功了!
He made it!

856
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,640
他成功了
He made it.

857
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,080
桑克  该你了
Thunk. Your turn.

859
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,900
你到了那边  我也就到了
When you make it, so will I.

860
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,030
你真棒
You did good.

861
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,950
老爸
Daddy.

863
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,830
等下 ! 你今天让我刮目相看  傻孩子
Wait! You surprised me today. Lunkhead.

864
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,650
我还活着!
Still alive!

866
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,370
我想弥补一切  却没有时间了
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.

867
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,850
我会弥补的
I can fix it.

868
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,180
感觉真好
This works good.

873
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,890
我爱你
I love you.

874
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,650
我...
I...

875
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,390
老爸
Dad,

880
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,050
他们有麻烦了  挺住!  我来了!
They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm coming!

881
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,150
我要怎么过去呢?  好好想一想
How do I get across? I gotta think.

883
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,710
我会怎么做呢?
What would I do?

884
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:44,020
拿着
Hold this.

885
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,760
我...有...
I... have...

887
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,050
跑啊
Run!

889
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:59,450
抓紧了!
Hold on!

890
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,380
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

891
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,890
我去和她说吧
I'll tell her.

892
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,950
我还没来得及告诉他
I've never had to tell him.

893
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,630
小伊  要是你老爸在  他会让你...
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...

894
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,810
快让开!
Get out of the way!

895
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:49,150
你学得可真像
you sound just like him.

896
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:52,420
快让开!
Get out of the way!

898
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:57,300
他乘着太阳
He's riding the sun,

900
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,390
阿瓜
Grug!

901
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:12,590
危险在哪儿?  谁吹的号?
Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?

902
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,890
我也爱你!
I love you, too!

909
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,300
男孩总得养个宠物吧
boy's got to have a pet.

912
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:09,660
你们快来看啊
You really need to see this.

913
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,240
我们去那里吧
We should go there.

915
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,990
这就是我  我是小伊
This is me. My name is Eep.

916
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,290
这是我们一家  克鲁德一家
And this is my family, the Croods.

919
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,140
再来一次  我好像眨眼了
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

920
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,170
世界依然艰辛险恶
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile.

921
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,820
但我们对未来充满信心
But now we know the Croods will make it,

925
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,130
放出宝宝
Release the baby!

927
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:41,990
从今往后  我们将在外面的世界生活 并在这里追逐光明
So from now on, we'll stay out here,where we can follow the light.
