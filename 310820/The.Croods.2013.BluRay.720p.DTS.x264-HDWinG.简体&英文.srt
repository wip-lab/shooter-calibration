26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,500
我们是仅存的一家了
We were the last ones around.

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,180
曾经有很多邻居
There used to be neighbors.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,820
高茨一家  被猛犸象踩扁了
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,700
霍克一家  被沙蛇吞了
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,100
他不但强壮  而且遵守规则
He was strong, and he followed the rules,

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,480
新鲜事物都很危险  好奇心也很危险
Anything new is bad. Curiosity is bad.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,910
总而言之  有趣的事情都危险
Basically, anything fun is bad.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,490
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,760
你应该等我信号的  小伊
You're supposed to wait for my signal, Eep.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,970
小伊
Eep.

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,510
我就回洞里  你就可以发信号了
I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,520
没事了  桑克  出来吧
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,440
可如果你不发信号  我怎么知道你是我老爸？
But if you don't give me the signal, how do I know you're my dad?

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
信号不是为了验明我的正身
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,690
是为了证明我还没被野兽吃掉
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,170
那为何信号是野兽叫啊？
Then why is the signal an animal noise?

64
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,170
我还在等信号
I'm still waiting for the signal.

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,850
谢谢啦
Thanks.

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,290
小伊  启动刹车！
Eep, put on the brakes!

94
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,320
小伊！
Eep!

96
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,830
干得好  老爸
Good one, Dad.

97
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,650
给你  桑克  尽情喝吧
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

103
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,330
黑暗意味着死亡！  都明白吧
Darkness brings death! We know this.

106
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,790
我可不想被洗掉保护皮
I don't want to lose my protective layer.

107
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,380
妈妈  你身上都长蚂蚁了
Mom, you've got ants.

108
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,480
看看 ？ 仙蒂都不闹
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

110
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,590
请你明天一定要回来
Please come back tomorrow.

111
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,330
她怎么会不喜欢洞穴？  多温馨啊
How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.

112
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,670
太黑了点  是吧？
It is a little dark, right?

114
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,560
小伊
Eep!

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,290
快来  我要关门了
Come on, I gotta close the cave.

116
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,340
小伊！
Eep!

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,540
恐惧让我们生存  小伊
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.

128
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,370
这一切有何意义呢？
What's the point of all this?

131
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,370
没人说生存是件趣事
No one said survival is fun.

132
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,750
一切都了无生趣
Nothing is fun.

144
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,210
好的  能借用一下吗？  多谢
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

164
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,220
我明白  老爸  我永远不会去尝鲜
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.

176
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,780
哇  你可真是强壮
Wow, you're really strong.

180
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,010
加油  加油
Come on, come on

195
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,900
我同意  虎妞  我们必须马上离开
I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

196
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,330
我都不认识你
I don't even know you.

204
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,560
首先  大地会颤抖  然后裂开
First, the ground is gonna shake. Then it breaks open.

211
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,040
跟我来吧
Come with me.

214
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,980
如果你能活下来  呼叫我
If you survive, call me.

215
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,650
谢谢
Thank you.

218
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,170
没有  我自己出来的
Nothing. I left on my own.

220
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,120
你从不让我解释
You never let me talk.

221
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,750
你被关禁闭了
You're grounded.

223
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,610
阿瓜！  怎么回事？
Grug! What happened?

226
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,840
我找到了一样新东西
I found something new.

238
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,170
你们有毛病吗？
What is wrong with you?

244
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,220
什么？
What?

245
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,700
你不能关我一辈子！
You can't keep me inside forever!

249
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,220
小心！
Look out!

250
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
停！
Stop!

253
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,980
不
No.

254
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,010
你们真该来看看
You really need to see this.

256
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,170
哪儿都不许去
No one is going anywhere.

257
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,690
那男孩还说了什么？
What else did that boy say?

260
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,230
六个
Six.

263
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,730
有一点可以确定  我们回不去了
One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came.

266
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,860
我们不能像这样暴露在外面
We can't be out in the open like this.

267
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,410
我们要找个洞穴
We need a cave.

268
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,710
踩着我的脚印走
Now step where I step.

269
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,430
好的  保持安静
Okay. Stay quiet.

270
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,830
希望还没有大家伙注意到我们
Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet.

271
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,100
等等！  好了
Wait! Okay.

272
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,120
等等！  好了
Wait! Okay.

273
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,810
等等！
Wait!

274
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,190
等等！
Wait!

275
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
好了  等等
Okay. Wait.

276
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,160
等等
Wait.

283
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,490
好的  爸爸  拿下它们
All right, Dad, go get them.

286
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,570
爸爸  我知道了
Dad, I got this.

297
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,590
六个
Six.

300
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,650
他怕黑！
He's scared of the dark!

303
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,340
小伊！
Eep!

304
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,310
小伊！
Eep!

311
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,970
好的  闭上眼
All right. Close your eyes.

312
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,480
我来取他们性命
I'm going to have to take their lives.

313
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,430
不  没用的  他们是我的家人
No, it won't help. They're my family.

314
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,400
什么
What?

323
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,220
我们现在就坐在这儿等太阳出来
Now we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.

324
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,630
明天我们去找一个新的洞穴
tomorrow we'll find a new cave

328
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,850
鬼知道他从哪冒出来的
Goodness knows where he's been.

329
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,730
爸爸  仙蒂在伤害火！
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire!

338
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,810
没错  但我不会让他得逞的
Yeah. But I won't let him.

339
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,360
等一下  儿子  回来！
Hold on, son, come back!

340
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,070
它停不下来  别碰我！
It won't stop. Stop touching me!

341
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,550
滚开！
Get out!

342
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,810
尽情吃吧  宝宝们！
Eat up, babies!

344
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,540
我赢了
I win!

350
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,810
跟魔术一样！
Looks like magic!

354
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,320
来吧  继续吃！
Come on, keep eating!

358
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,630
已经发生了  它毁了我们的洞穴
That already happened. It destroyed our cave.

359
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,300
不  这只是末日的前兆
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

360
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,740
真正的末日还在后头
The end of the end is still coming.

361
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,250
小伊  把他放下
Eep. Drop it.

362
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,770
我们不能让他跑了！
We can't let him go!

363
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,810
要是日落前没找到洞穴怎么办？
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?

364
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,070
要是得找上好几天怎么办？
What if it takes a few days?

365
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,110
要是那群鸟又来了怎么办？
What if the birds come back?

366
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,080
我们需要他的火  笨蛋！
We need his fire, dummy!

367
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,780
好吧  你就待到我们找到洞穴为止
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.

369
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,240
你们想留下就留下  但是放我走
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

370
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,960
我还有梦想  有使命
I've got a dream, a mission,

375
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,330
山上也有洞穴
There are caves on that Mountain.

376
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,590
你去过了？
Have you been there?

377
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,020
那是座山
It's a mountain.

378
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,430
山上很安全  山上有洞穴
Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves.

380
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,410
妈妈  你听见没？
Mom, did you hear that?

381
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,470
我可以有自己的树枝了！
I can get my own stick!

385
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,510
那玩意真奇怪
That thing is weird.

386
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,420
不不不  没事  仙蒂
No. No. No. It's okay, Sandy.

391
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,790
我们可从来没走过这么远
We've never really walked that far.

392
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,800
我的脚可受不了
I don't think my feet can do that.

393
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,640
我可活不到走到的那一天
I'll never live long enough to get there.

394
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,920
那我们走吧
Let's do it.

395
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,050
来吧  你们想一想
come on, just think.

396
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,570
我们全家人一起
Our whole family, packed together

400
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,860
一家人的感情会更好
We'll become closer as a family.

406
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,950
是不是很有趣？  我们第一次一起旅行
Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.

407
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,230
别推我  不然我拔掉你舌头
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!

411
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,450
仙蒂  快把那东西吐出来
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

420
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,530
我不要做个饿死鬼
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

421
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
阿瓜  我们都很累了
Grug, we're all pretty tired.

427
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,710
我们管那种东西叫小孩
We call those children.

428
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,610
人不应该养宠物
No man should have a pet.

431
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,040
不是它  是它！
Not that. That!

432
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,120
食物能解决任何问题
Food fixes everything.

433
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
好了  进入狩猎状态
All right, show me your hunting face.

434
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,770
不是你！  你还在禁闭中
Not you! You're still grounded.

435
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,990
来吧  桑克
Come on, Thunk.

436
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,550
我的脚好痛
My feet hurt.

439
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,760
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

440
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,890
坚持住  桑克  我来了
Hang on, Thunk. I'm coming.

460
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,700
你身上没肉
You're too skinny.

465
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,070
稳住她  用石头
Hold her still. Use a rock.

477
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,310
你一个人过多久了？
How long have you been alone?

478
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,820
那我们要做什么？
So what do we do?

479
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,410
你的演技如何？
How's your acting?

480
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,820
你很擅长这个啊
You're good at this.

481
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,840
不对  抱歉  不是  就这样
No, Sorry. No. Okay.

482
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,990
不好意思
Excuse me.

488
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,090
她好厉害
She's awesome.

489
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,460
小伊！
Eep!

490
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,080
老爸  别！
Dad, no!

492
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
看样子是不会剩了
Looks like we won't have any leftovers.

497
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,350
阿瓜  来讲个故事吧？
Grug, how about a story?

500
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,520
很久以前  有只小老虎
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger

511
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,850
她前脚刚走  她家的山洞就被毁了
And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed

519
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,750
我的故事是不会就这样潦草结束的
My stories never end like that.

520
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,990
太好了  一晚上俩故事
Yes! Two stories in one night!

521
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,030
好吧  但没有阿瓜的那么精彩
Okay, but it won't be as good as Grug's.

522
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,170
很久以前  有只美丽的老虎
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.

523
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,290
她和家人住在一个山洞里
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.

541
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,020
她飞去了哪里？
Where did she fly?

543
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,980
在那里  天空中的星星多得数不清
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.

544
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,420
那会很明亮啊
It would be so bright.

545
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,260
那里不像今天亦或昨天
A place not like today, or yesterday.

546
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,370
那里的一切都更美好
A place where things are better.

547
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,590
明天又不是个地方
Tomorrow isn't a place.

551
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,510
那就是我要去的地方
That's where I'm going.

552
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,550
行了  该去睡觉了
Well, we are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

557
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,020
有我看着呢  没事
I was watching. We were fine.

562
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,850
那只老虎是怎么飞的？
How did the tiger fly?

564
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,810
那样我才有激情
I'm funny that way.

565
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,440
看我的吧
Leave this to me.

566
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,970
桑克  你脸上有只蜘蛛
Thunk, you have a spider on your face.

567
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,390
他跑掉了！
He's loose!

568
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,870
别去踩那些奇怪的尖石头！
Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks!

569
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,070
你是说这些石头吗？
You mean these rocks?

570
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,120
千万不要踩  ！
Do not step on these rocks!

00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,120
那好
Okay.

609
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,860
现在  让我们朝那座山迈进吧
Now let's get to that Mountain.

629
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,000
笑话是什么
What's a joke?

642
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,650
你的方法不安全
Your way isn't safe.

645
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,120
保护你们的安全是我的责任
It's my job to keep you safe.

646
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,100
这里还是我说了算
 I'm still in charge,

652
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,700
老爸  我有点害怕
Dad, I'm freaking out a little bit.

653
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,730
告诉我该怎么做
Just tell me what to do.

657
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,190
所有人都往前走  我们会走出去的
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.

659
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,110
是的  好吧
Yeah. Okay.

660
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,160
记住  千万不要害怕
Remember, never not be afraid.

663
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,950
我要晕过去了
I'm gonna pass out.

665
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,190
再给我一朵
Give me another one.

666
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,550
你掉东西了
You dropped these.

667
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,240
跟我走
Come with me.

671
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,140
阿瓜?
Grug?

672
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,680
我去接他
I'll go get him.

677
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,170
你能做动作吗?
Can you do tricks?

678
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,150
翻身
Roll over.

684
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,290
我们喂对方吃浆果  一起跳舞
We fed each other berries. We danced.

685
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,950
然后我爸用石头把他捶成肉泥
Then my father smashed him with a rock,

688
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,440
阿瓜  他们没事
Grug, they're okay.

689
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,390
有盖伊在呢
Guy's with them.

701
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,220
这些天是他们生命中最多彩的日子
they had the best day in their lives.

703
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,200
我带你们看样东西
I wanna show you something.

704
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,210
数都数不清的太阳
More suns in the sky than you can count.

707
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,300
我要跟盖伊一起走  
I'm going with Guy.

709
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,950
跟我们一起走吧
Come with us.

710
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,570
我不能扔下阿瓜
I can't go without Grug.

713
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,460
阿瓜根本不知道怎么保护我们
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

735
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,270
绘画已经过时了
Painting is a thing of the past.

740
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,980
你哪来的这些好主意?
Where do you get these great ideas?

758
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,720
你懂的  双赢
you know, win-win.

764
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,150
我们要乘着太阳和盖伊一起去明天
We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.

782
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,370
还记得今早你什么样吗?
Remember how you were this morning?

783
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,270
你变了  记得吗?
You changed, remember?

793
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:14,910
我知道
I know.

795
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,530
对不起
Sorry.

796
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,510
当时我还很小
I was little when it happened.

800
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:54,880
你追求光明  我女儿很像你
You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.

801
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,480
不  他像你
No. She's like you.

802
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,110
她爱你  却总是忘记说出口
She loves you but always forgets to say it,

804
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:11,350
也许因为我总是忙着保护他们
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.

808
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,950
来吧  你行的
Come on, you can do it.

821
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,430
抓紧了!
Hold on!

824
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,780
我们没事!
We're okay!

825
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,580
我们很好
We're okay.

827
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,420
带我们去明天吧
Take us to Tomorrow.

842
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,260
不要黑暗  不再躲藏
No more dark. No more hiding.

851
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,740
这是个机会
It's a chance.

855
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,300
他成功了!
He made it!

856
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,640
他成功了
He made it.

857
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,080
桑克  该你了
Thunk. Your turn.

860

861

老爸
Daddy.

863
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,830
等下  你今天让我刮目相看  傻孩子
Wait! You surprised me today. Lunkhead.

866
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,370
我想弥补一切  却没有时间了
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.

867
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,850
我会弥补的
I can fix it.

868
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,180
感觉真好
This works good.

873
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,890
我爱你
I love you.

874
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,650
我...
I...

875
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,390
老爸

这里不安全
It's not safe here.

891

我去和她说吧
I'll tell her.

893
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,630
小伊  要是你老爸在  他会让你...
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...

905
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:33,880
七
seven.

912
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:09,660
你们快来看啊
You really need to see this.

913
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,240
我们去那里吧
We should go there.

915
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,990
这就是我  我是小伊
This is me. My name is Eep.

this is my family, the Croods.

918
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:46,590
我们不再是原始人了

925
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,130
放出宝宝!
