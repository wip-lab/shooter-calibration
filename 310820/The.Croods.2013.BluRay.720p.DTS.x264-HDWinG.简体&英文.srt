都是崭新的开始
A new beginning.

14

总是期冀今日之美远胜昨日
A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,160
但不属于我   我叫小伊
But not for me. My name's Eep.

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,380
这是我的家人  克鲁德一家
And this is my family. The Croods.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,750
如果你看到我们的兽皮和倾斜的额头
If you weren't clued already, by animal skin

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,470
还不明白  我们是原始人
and sloping forehead, we are cavemen.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,930
我们整日在洞穴中度日
Most days we spend in our cave,

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,790
藏于黑暗
in the dark.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,770
日复一日  年复一年
Night after night, day after day.

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,640
真是甜蜜的家啊
Yep. Home sweet home.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,030
难得出洞  还得在残酷的大自然里
When we did go out, we struggled to find food

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,600
拼命找食物
in a harsh and hostile world.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,430
我还得拼命保护家人
And I struggled to survive my family.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,500
我们是仅存的一家了
We were the last ones around.

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,180
曾经有很多邻居
There used to be neighbors.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,820
高茨一家  被猛犸象踩扁了
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,700
霍克一家  被沙蛇吞了
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,920
厄夫一家  被蚊子叮死了
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,700
斯洛格一家  感个冒就挂了
The Throgs, common cold.

32
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,850
还有克鲁德一家  就是我们
And the Croods... That's us.

33
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,250
我们活下来了  全靠我老爸
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,100
他不但强壮  而且遵守规则
He was strong, and he followed the rules,

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,570
规矩都刻在洞穴的墙上了
the ones painted on our cave walls:

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,480
新鲜事物都很危险  好奇心也很危险
Anything new is bad. Curiosity is bad.

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,640
夜晚出门更是危险
Going out at night is bad.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,910
总而言之  有趣的事情都危险
Basically, anything fun is bad.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,490
欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome to my world.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,860
这故事讲的是这一切如何瞬间改变
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.

41
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,950
因为我们还不知道
Because what we didn't know was that our world

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,350
我们的世界面临末日
was about to come to an end.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,310
我们洞穴的墙上
And there were no rules on our cave walls

44
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,000
可没有应对之法
to prepare us for that.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,760
你应该等我信号的  小伊
You're supposed to wait for my signal, Eep.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,970
小伊
Eep.

47
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,110
我在洞里呆够了
We've been in that cave forever.

48
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,830
三天可不算长吧
Three days is not forever.

49
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,330
和你们一起度日如年
It is with this family.

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,320
小伊  拜托下来好吗
Eep, will you come down here?

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,190
你真是  太夸张了
You're being so... so dramatic.

52
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,720
别别别  仙蒂  快回来
No, no, no, Sandy, come back here!

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,580
记住信号  好女孩总是等信号
Remember the signal. Good girls wait for the signal.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,710
-乌格  -一抓到仙蒂
- Ugga! - As soon as I get Sandy,

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,510
我就回洞里  你就可以发信号了
I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.

56
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,420
可是  你已经出来了啊
No. But you're already out now.

57
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,330
我在乖乖等信号呢  老爸
I am waiting for the signal, Dad!

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,520
没事了  桑克  出来吧
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,440
可如果你不发信号  我怎么知道你是我老爸
But if you don't give me the signal, how do I know you're my dad?

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
信号不是为了验明我的正身
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,690
是为了证明我还没被野兽吃掉
It's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,170
那为何信号是野兽叫啊
Then why is the signal an animal noise?

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,270
那样不会产生歧义吗
I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?

64
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,170
我还在等信号
I'm still waiting for the signal.

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
妈妈  准备出发
Mom, we're ready to leave!

66
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,120
妈妈
Mom?

67
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,690
我还没死呢
Still alive!

68
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,660
大限还没到
It's still early.

69
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,570
你这个死肥仔
And you're still fat.

70
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,960
组成早餐队形
Breakfast formation!

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,460
发挥出洞穴人应有的水平来
I want to see some real caveman action out there!

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,760
勇往直前  奋勇争先
We do this fast. We do this loud,

73
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,680
我们齐心协力
we do this as a family,

74
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,060
疯狂原始人

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,020
时刻保持警惕
and never not be afraid!

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,700
冲啊  克鲁德们
The croods

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,360
吃早餐啦
Yay breakfast.

78
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,630
好了  该谁了  猜字决定
Okay, who's up? We'll flip for it.

79
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,880
-快决定吧  -头朝上
- Call her in the air. - Heads!

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,190
屁股朝上  桑克赢了  各就位
Tails. Thunk's in. Positions!

81
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,850
好了  桑克  出发
Okay. Thunk, go!

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,570
快点  桑克
Come on, Thunk.

83
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,750
干得好  带着蛋回洞穴
Way to go! Take it to the cave!

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,330
快放出宝宝
Release the baby!

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,090
干掉他们  仙蒂  加油
Get 'em, Sandy, go!

86
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,080
加油  妈妈
Get them, Mom!

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,300
老太婆倒啦
Old lady down!

88
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,920
小伊  替我报仇
Eep, avenge me!

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,850
谢谢啦
Thanks.

90
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,620
-小伊  -接好了
- Eep! - Heads up!

91
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,530
老爸  能开饭了吗
Hey, Dad, can we eat now?

92
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,310
等回到家再说吧
Just wait til we get home.

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,290
小伊  启动刹车
Eep, put on the brakes!

94
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,320
小伊
Eep!

95
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,320
谁想吃饭
Who's hungry?

96
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,830
干得好  老爸
Good one, Dad.

97
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,650
给你  桑克  尽情喝吧
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

98
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,680
-对不住  老爸  -看来今天要吃快餐啦
- Sorry, dad. - Looks like fast food tonight!

99
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,550
没事  我上周吃过了
That's all right. I ate last week.

100
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,290
夕阳警报
Two knuckle warning!

101
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,060
快走快走
Go, go, go.

102
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,150
赶紧  赶紧
Come on, come on.

103
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,330
黑暗意味着死亡  都明白吧
Darkness brings death! We know this.

104
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,740
满月之夜  该洗澡了
The moon is full. Bath night.

105
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,780
-快逃命啊  -你也得洗  妈妈
- Run for your life! - You too, Mom.

106
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,790
我可不想被洗掉保护皮
I don't want to lose my protective layer.

107
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,380
妈妈  你身上都长蚂蚁了
Mom, you've got ants.

108
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,480
看看  仙蒂都不闹
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

109
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,980
-她还还外面吗  -你知道她讨厌洞穴
- Is she still out there? - You know she hates the cave, Grug.

110
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,590
请你明天一定要回来
Please come back tomorrow.

111
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,330
她怎么会不喜欢洞穴  多温馨啊
How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.

112
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,670
太黑了点  是吧
It is a little dark, right?

113
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,230
也没那么黑
It's not that dark.

114
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,560
小伊
Eep!

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,290
快来  我要关门了
Come on, I gotta close the cave.

116
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,340
小伊
Eep!

117
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,380
来了  来了
Okay! Okay!

118
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,860
快回来
Come on.

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,130
小伊  快下来
Eep! Come down!

120
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,510
-刚才太危险了  -我只是看看  又没事
- That was too close! - I was watching. I was fine.

121
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,600
-你在干什么  小伊  -我也不知道
- What were you doing up there, Eep? - I don't know.

122
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,180
-你在找什么  -没什么
- What were you looking for? - Nothing.

123
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,370
好吧  那你上去干吗
Well then, why did you go up there?

124
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,370
-说了不知道  -你为什么不知道
- I don't know! - Why don't you know?

125
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,670
别去找什么鬼东西了
Stop looking for things!

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,540
恐惧让我们生存  小伊
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.

127
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,410
时刻保持警惕
Never not be afraid.

128
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,370
这一切有何意义呢
What's the point of all this?

129
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,240
-你说什么  -我说  我们在这里干吗
- What was that? - I mean, why are we here?

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,140
我们这么躲藏是为什么
What are we doing this for?

131
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,370
没人说生存是件趣事
No one said survival is fun.

132
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,750
一切都了无生趣
Nothing is fun.

133
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,550
-请你下来好吗  小伊  -阿瓜
- Would you come down here? Eep? - Grug?

134
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,730
-下来  下来  -好吧  我只是想
- Off! Off!- Yes. Okay. I am trying to

135
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,690
我就是不明白她为什么要自己在上面
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge.

136
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,920
仅此而已  我就是想知道
That's all. That's what this is about.

137
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,270
她在思索罢了  她需要自己的空间
She's working through some things and needs some space.

138
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,930
思索什么  要思索多久
What things? How long is this going to take?

139
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,340
她都不肯听我说话了
Really? She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

140
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,810
看吧  她听着呢
See? She's listening.

141
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,820
要想生存  她就必须遵守规矩
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.

142
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,730
-讲个故事吧  小伊爱听故事  -好主意
- How about a story? Eep loves those. - That's a good idea.

143
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,490
-谁想听故事  -快讲一个
- How about a story, huh? - Yeah, tell us a story.

144
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,210
好的  能借用一下吗  多谢
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

145
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,250
小伊  你儿时的最爱
Eep! Your old favourite!

146
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,550
我都多少年没玩过那玩具了
I haven't played with that thing in years.

147
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,280
今晚我们来讲熊熊的故事
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.

148
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,830
很久以前  熊熊还活着
A long time ago, this little bear was alive.

149
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,640
她能活着  因为她听从老爸的话
She was alive because she listened to her father

150
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,380
整日在黑暗与恐惧中谨慎地生活
and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror.

151
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,710
所以她很快乐
So she was happy.

152
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,280
但是熊熊有个致命弱点
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

153
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,410
她充满了
She was filled with...

154
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,860
好奇心
curiosity.

155
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,930
-阿瓜  -好吧  好吧
- Grug! - Yes, yes.

156
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,290
有一天  好奇熊熊站在树上
And one day, while she was in a tree,

157
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,510
她想爬上树顶
the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.

158
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,360
-什么  -当她爬到树顶的时候
- What? - And no sooner had she climbed to the top

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,500
她看到了新鲜事物  然后  死了
she saw something new and died.

160
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,580
就这样完了
Just like that?

161
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,530
没错  她最后惊恐的表情
Yes! Her last moments of terror

162
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,930
还留在脸上
still frozen on her face.

163
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,400
每次都是这个结局
Same ending as every day.

164
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,220
我明白  老爸  我永远不会去尝鲜
I get it, Dad. I will never do anything new or different.

165
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,240
-桑克真是好孩子  -大家磨磨牙齿
- Good man, Thunk. - All right, everyone sharpen your teeth

166
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,450
抱团睡吧
and let's pile up.

167
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,910
-空气  -你会说话
- Air - You talk.

168
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,850
我和你一样  是个人
I'm person, like you.

169
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,930
差不多  一样
Sort of... like you.

170
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,480
好吧  好吧  喂喂喂
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey,

171
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,570
喂  拜托你  拜托你不要
Hey. Could you... Could you mind not...

172
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,330
好痒  喂喂喂
That tickles. Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

173
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,190
安静  我不应该出门的
Quiet! I am not supposed to be out here.

174
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,590
-小伊不见了  -你说什么  阿瓜
- Eep's gone. - What? Grug!

175
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,620
呆在洞里
Stay in the cave!

176
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,780
哇  你可真是强壮
Wow, you're really strong.

177
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,430
-别  那是我的  别  -请不要
- No! It's mine! No! No! - Please

178
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,690
-它快灭了  -是我抓住的
- But it is dying!  - I caught it.

179
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,370
我能让它复燃  拜托  我讨厌黑暗
I can fix it. Please. Please. I hate the dark.

180
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,010
加油  加油
Come on, come on

181
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,920
它听你的命令吗
It does what you tell it?

182
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,390
那个  算是吧
Well, yeah, sort of.

183
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,310
-太阳吗  -不是  是火
-Sun? - No, no. Fire.

184
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,120
你好啊  火儿
Hi, Fire.

185
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,440
它没有生命
It's not alive.

186
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,660
你不是说它快"死"了吗
But you said it was dying.

187
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,660
英文"死亡"兼有"熄灭"之意

188
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,230
-抱歉  -它来自你的故乡吗
- Sorry. - It comes from where you came from?

189
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,650
-不  我创造了它  -帮我造一点
- No, I make it. - Make some for me.

190
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,480
-那个  它不是从我身上出来的  -快造
- Okay! It doesn't come out of me. - Make.

191
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,870
造  快造
Make. Make it!

192
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,990
你真是杀人不眨眼
You do this a lot.

193
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,020
你死了吗  你死了我可以继承你的火吗
Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead?

194
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,520
那玩意很凉  是吗  顺风耳贝  启动
Hey, those are cold! You think? Listening shells, activate.

195
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,900
我同意  虎妞  我们必须马上离开
I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

196
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,330
我都不认识你
I don't even know you.

197
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,020
- 我叫盖伊  - 盖伊
- I'm Guy. - Guy?

198
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,040
这是皮带猴  是我的厨子聊伴兼导游
And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator,

199
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,310
也帮我拎裤子
also keeps my pants up.

200
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,250
-什么是"拎裤子"  -你叫什么
- What are 'pants up'? - Who are you?

201
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,910
-小伊  -我来解释一下  世界要毁灭
- Eep. - Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending.

202
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,020
-什么  -我把它叫做  末日
- What? - I'm calling it..."The End."

203
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,810
-你怎么知道  -我看到了  就要来了
- How do you know? - I've seen it. It's coming this way.

204
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,560
首先  大地会颤抖  然后裂开
First, the ground is gonna shake. Then it breaks open.

205
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,020
万物跌入其中
Everything falls in.

206
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,010
烈火  熔岩  我不想太夸张  但是
Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

207
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,620
相信我  我们脚下的一切
Believe me, everything we're standing on,

208
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,750
所有的一切  都会毁灭
all this right here, will be gone.

209
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,700
我们必须去高地  我知道有座山
We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain,

210
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
在那边  那是我们唯一的机会
that way. It's our only chance.

211
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,040
跟我来吧
Come with me.

212
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,800
-我不能  -好吧
- I can't. - Okay.

213
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,820
这个
Here.

214
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,980
如果你能活下来  呼叫我
If you survive, call me.

215
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,650
谢谢
Thank you.

216
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,770
人呢
Hello?

217
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,890
-老爸  -你受伤了吗  谁抓了你
- Dad! - Are you hurt? What took you?

218
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,170
没有  我自己出来的
Nothing. I left on my own.

219
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,570
-你说什么  -老爸  听我解释
- You... what? - Dad, let me explain.

220
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,120
你从不让我解释
You never let me talk.

221
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,750
你被关禁闭了
You're grounded.

222
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,530
-小伊  -妈妈
- Eep! - Mom!

223
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,610
阿瓜  怎么回事
Grug! What happened?

224
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,310
我现在很生气  不想和她说话
You know what, I am so mad right now that I can't talk to her.

225
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,540
-小伊  -说了你也不信
- Eep? - You'll never believe it.

226
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,840
我找到了一样新东西
I found something new.

227
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,930
-新东西  -新东西可是大麻烦
- New? - New is a big problem.

228
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,900
等等
Wait. Wait.

229
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,070
小伊  待在家庭作战队形里
Eep, stay inside the family kill circle.

230
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,160
-但它并不坏  -新即是坏
- But it wasn't bad. - New is always bad.

231
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,730
-不  他人很好  -什么  他
- No. He was nice. - What? Excuse me? He?

232
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,740
刚开始我还以为他是只野猪
Well, I thought he was a warthog,

233
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,190
后来才发现是个男孩
but then he turned into a boy.

234
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,140
奇怪  一般都反过来才对
Strange. Usually it's the reverse.

235
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,430
小伊找了个雄猪猪
Eep's got a boy hog!

236
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,810
小伊找了个雄...
Eep's got a boy...

237
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,240
他是个男孩  好吗  我现在就叫他来
There was a boy. Watch, okay? I'm gonna call him.

238
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,170
你们有毛病吗
What is wrong with you?

239
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,500
-它很危险  -它很漂亮
- It was dangerous. - It was beautiful.

240
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,750
什么叫危险  这才是
You want to see dangerous? Here.

241
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,490
-我的嗅探鼻  -小伊  够了
- Ow! My sniffer! - Okay, Eep, that's it.

242
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,560
我们现在就回洞穴
We're going back to the cave

243
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,140
你就在里边一直待到比她还老吧
and you're going to stay in there until you're older than her!

244
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,220
什么
What?

245
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,700
你不能关我一辈子
You can't keep me inside forever!

246
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,210
他说过会这样的
He said this would happen.

247
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,420
快回洞穴
Get to the cave.

248
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,610
快跑
Go!

249
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,220
小心
Look out!

250
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
停
Stop!

251
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,810
-都没事吧  -没事
- Is everyone okay? - Yes.

252
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,180
阿瓜  洞穴没了
Grug, the cave. It's gone.

253
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,980
不
No.

254
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,010
你们真该来看看
You really need to see this.

255
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
-我们应该去那儿  -不行
- We should go there! - No. No.

256
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,170
哪儿都不许去
No one is going anywhere.

257
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,690
那男孩还说了什么
What else did that boy say?

258
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,750
-快点  阿瓜  -快跑  跳下去
- Come on, Grug! - Just go. Go! Go!

259
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,680
一个  两个  三个  四个  五个
One, two, three, four, five...

260
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,230
六个
Six.

261
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,010
-我们这是在哪  -我不知道
- Where are we? - I don't know. I'm not sure.

262
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,040
在下面  低一点的地方
Down. In a lower place.

263
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,730
有一点可以确定  我们回不去了
One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came.

264
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,290
仙蒂  那是什么
Sandy? What is it?

265
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,180
别  等一下  回来  仙蒂
No, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy.

266
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,860
我们不能像这样暴露在外面
We can't be out in the open like this.

267
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,410
我们要找个洞穴
We need a cave.

268
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,710
踩着我的脚印走
Now step where I step.

269
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,430
好的  保持安静
Okay. Stay quiet.

270
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,830
希望还没有大家伙注意到我们
Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet.

271
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,100
等等  好了
Wait! Okay.

272
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,120
等等  好了
Wait! Okay.

273
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,810
等等
Wait!

274
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,190
等等
Wait!

275
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
好了  等等
Okay. Wait.

276
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,160
等等
Wait.

277
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,700
爸爸  难道还要找个一模一样的洞穴吗
So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?

278
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,610
要是我的话  我只是提个建议
Okay. If it was me... I was throwing this out there.

279
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,530
要是让我挑洞穴的话
If it was me choosing the cave,

280
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,990
我会挑个小一点的
I would go with a smaller cave.

281
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,710
等等
Wait!

282
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,280
-爸爸  -我来搞定
- Dad! - I'll take care of this.

283
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,490
好的  爸爸  拿下它们
All right, Dad, go get them.

284
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,420
拿下它们  这一拳真够...准的
Now you get them right in the no... Oh man, there.

285
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,900
看着真欢乐
Hah! I'm loving this.

286
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,570
爸爸  我知道了
Dad, I got this.

287
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,480
只要别再拿脸撞拳头就好了
Just stop running to their fists!

288
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,500
阿瓜  玩够了就上路吧
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.

289
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,560
怎么样  怕了吧
That's right! You can't get past this!

290
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,970
往上爬  往上爬
Climb! Climb! Climb!

291
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,850
快点
Move!

292
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,220
是洞穴  快跑
Cave! Go! Go!

293
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,530
来吧  快点  快点
Come on, hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

294
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,470
这洞穴居然还长舌头  酷毙了
Hey, look! This cave has a tongue! Awesome!

295
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,110
好的  一个  两个  三个
Okay. That's one, two, three,

296
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,750
四个  五个

297
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,590
六个
Six.

298
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,440
七个
And seven,

299
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,960
如果算上那只死神之猫的话
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

300
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,650
他怕黑
He's scared of the dark!

301
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,700
等一下  我们也怕黑
Wait, we're scared of the dark!

302
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,950
作战队形
Kill circle!

303
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,340
小伊
Eep!

304
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,310
小伊
Eep!

305
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,850
-是原始人  -原始人
- Cavies! - Cavies?

306
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,460
原始人  退后  他们跟野兽无异
Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals.

307
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,370
-看见他们后倾的额骨没  -是啊
- See their bony, sloping foreheads? - Yeah!

308
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,060
-他们原始的大板牙  -看见了
- The huge primitive teeth? - Yeah.

309
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,250
还有超浓密的体毛
The excessive body hair?

310
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,640
-这货还长着尾巴  -是啊
- That one's even got a tail! - Yeah.

311
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,970
好的  闭上眼
All right. Close your eyes.

312
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,480
我来取他们性命
I'm going to have to take their lives.

313
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,430
不  没用的  他们是我的家人
No, it won't help. They're my family.

314
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,400
什么
What?

315
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,320
-太阳在他的手里  -不  这是火
- The sun is in his hands! - No, no, it's fire.

316
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,000
-哪里来的  -他造出来的
- Where did it come from? - He made it.

317
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,770
-给我造点  -不是从他身上来的
- Make some for me! - It doesn't come out of him.

318
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,670
造  给我造
Make! Make it!

319
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,510
还真是虎父无犬女
You know, you're a lot like your daughter.

320
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,020
好极了  你把他弄坏了
Great, now he's broken!

321
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,980
看这太阳宝宝
Oh, it's a baby sun!

322
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,050
退后  不知道它是何方神圣
Hey! Stay back! We don't know what it wants.

323
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,220
我们现在就坐在这儿等太阳出来
Now we'll all sit here and wait for the sun to come back.

324
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,630
明天我们去找一个新的洞穴
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave

325
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,510
假装今天的事没发生过
and pretend today never happened.

326
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,750
很有趣吧  小伊
Isn't this fun, Eep?

327
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,350
小伊  别碰他
Eep, don't touch him!

328
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,850
鬼知道他从哪冒出来的
Goodness knows where he's been.

329
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,730
爸爸  仙蒂在伤害火
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire!

330
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,470
仙蒂  别这样  火不是用来玩的
Sandy! No! Fire is not a plaything.

331
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,490
-多讨人喜欢啊  -后退
- What a cute little guy. - Hey, stay back!

332
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,570
不不不  等等
No, no, no, wait!

333
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,880
它喜欢我  它在咬我
It likes me! Hey! It's biting me!

334
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,230
桑克  躲到高大的干草从里
Thunk! Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!

335
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,270
别  求你了  我才9岁  它在咬我
Stop, please! I'm only nine! It's biting me!

336
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,310
火宝宝
Fire babies!

337
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,670
你爸想要杀了我
So, your dad, he's trying to kill me.

338
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,810
没错  但我不会让他得逞的
Yeah. But I won't let him.

339
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,360
等一下  儿子  回来
Hold on, son, come back!

340
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,070
它停不下来  别碰我
It won't stop. Stop touching me!

341
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,550
滚开
Get out!

342
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,810
尽情吃吧  宝宝们
Eat up, babies!

343
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,360
去死
Die!

344
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,540
我赢了
I win!

345
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,290
熟了之后你就不觉得他们吓人了
They're not so scary once you get to know them.

346
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,520
你们到底是什么人
Who are you people?

347
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,490
真抱歉  我们是克鲁德一家
Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croods!

348
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,040
你呢
And you are?

349
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,620
-我是盖伊  -你好  盖伊
- Guy. - Hi, Guy.

350
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,810
跟魔术一样
Looks like magic!

351
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,900
闻起来好美味
And smells like food.

352
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,540
别吃  这是新事物
Don't eat it, it's new.

353
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,650
我们还活着
Still alive!

354
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,320
来吧  继续吃
Come on, keep eating!

355
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,000
盖伊在哪
Hey, where's Guy?

356
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,270
-要去哪  -山上
- Going somewhere? -The Mountain.

357
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,450
高地  世界末日  还记得吗
High ground. End of the world, remember?

358
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,630
已经发生了  它毁了我们的洞穴
That already happened. It destroyed our cave.

359
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,300
不  这只是末日的前兆
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

360
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,740
真正的末日还在后头
The end of the end is still coming.

361
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,250
小伊  把他放下
Eep. Drop it.

362
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,770
我们不能让他跑了
We can't let him go!

363
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,810
要是日落前没找到洞穴怎么办
What if we don't find a cave before sunset?

364
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,070
要是得找上好几天怎么办
What if it takes a few days?

365
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,110
要是那群鸟又来了怎么办
What if the birds come back?

366
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,080
我们需要他的火  笨蛋
We need his fire, dummy!

367
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,780
好吧  你就待到我们找到洞穴为止
Fine. You're staying with us until we find a cave.

368
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,220
什么  我不要  我不要掺进来
What? No, I'm not! Don’t make me part of this.

369
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,240
你们想留下就留下  但是放我走
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

370
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,960
我还有梦想  有使命
I've got a dream, a mission,

371
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,460
有活下去的理由
a reason to live!

372
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,690
现在没了
Not anymore!

373
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,550
我有个主意  我们去那座山上吧
I've got an idea. Let's go to that Mountain.

374
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,110
-太远了  -我爸一心只想要找洞穴
- It's too far. - Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

375
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,330
山上也有洞穴
There are caves on that Mountain.

376
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,590
你去过了
Have you been there?

377
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,020
那是座山
It's a mountain.

378
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,430
山上很安全  山上有洞穴
Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves.

379
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,850
有水  有树枝
Water. Sticks.

380
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,410
妈妈  你听见没
Mom, did you hear that?

381
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,470
我可以有自己的树枝了
I can get my own stick!

382
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,280
是的  树枝  还有洞穴
Yes. Sticks. And caves.

383
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,330
洞穴跟树枝  好多树枝呢  走吧
Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go.

384
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,130
别吵
Quiet!

385
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,510
那玩意真奇怪
That thing is weird.

386
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,420
不不不  没事  仙蒂
No. No. No. It's okay, Sandy.

387
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,940
那是只皮带猴
That's just a belt.

388
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,960
我决定了  我们要去那座山
I've made a decision. We're going to that Mountain!

389
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,760
别问为什么  我只是有预感
Don't ask me why. It's just a hunch.

390
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,710
-跟着感觉走  -我不知道  阿瓜
- It just feels right. - I don't know, Grug.

391
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,790
我们可从来没走过这么远
We've never really walked that far.

392
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,800
我的脚可受不了
I don't think my feet can do that.

393
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,640
我可活不到走到的那一天
I'll never live long enough to get there.

394
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,920
那我们走吧
Let's do it.

395
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,050
来吧  你们想一想
Oh, come on, just think.

396
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,570
我们全家人一起
Our whole family, packed together

397
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,250
来一次周游各地的长途旅行
on a long, slow trip across the country?

398
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,420
从早到晚都待在一起
Days and nights with just each other?

399
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,180
一路讲故事  开怀大笑
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

400
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,860
一家人的感情会更好
We'll become closer as a family.

401
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:36,850
弄走她  弄走她
Get her off! Get her off!

402
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,190
要是你没作好挑战她的准备
If you're not ready to challenge her,

403
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,550
那就别直视她的眼睛
then don't look her in the eye.

404
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,680
你的大粗胳膊
Could you keep your big giant arms

405
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,240
能老实点吗
on your side of the trail?

406
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,950
是不是很有趣  我们第一次一起旅行
Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.

407
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,230
别推我  不然我拔掉你舌头
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!

408
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,710
你们想尝尝我的拳头吗  想吗
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?

409
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,600
我已经准备好胖揍你们一顿了
Because I will turn this family around so fast!

410
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,990
-爸爸  我憋不住了  -你可以的
- Dad, I gotta go! - Come on, you can hold it.

411
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,450
仙蒂  快把那东西吐出来
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

412
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,610
-我还是憋不住  -好吧
- I still gotta go! - Fine.

413
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,680
-别闹了  -快去快回
- Quit it! - Just make it fast.

414
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,250
-有东西咬我  -那是你活该
- Something bit me! - I don't blame it!

415
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,780
-爸爸  能让我扛他吗  -不行
- Dad, can I take a turn carrying him? - No.

416
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,410
-现在呢  -不行
- What about now? - No!

417
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,820
-现在呢  -不行
- Now? - No!

418
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,290
-现在呢  -我能扛一整天
- Now? - I can do this all day long.

419
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,840
不行  不行  就是不行
No, no, no, and still no!

420
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,530
我不要做个饿死鬼
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

421
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
阿瓜  我们都很累了
Grug, we're all pretty tired.

422
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,670
-到了我们就吃东西  -老娘等不及了
- We'll eat when we get there. - It's taking too long!

423
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,630
我先吃点零食
I'm grabbing a snack.

424
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,940
别这样  他会砍你的  这不是食物
Don't do that! He will cut you. That's not food,

425
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,260
他是我的宠物
he's a pet. My pet.

426
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,070
-宠物是什么  -就是不能吃的动物
- What's a pet? - An animal you don't eat.

427
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,710
我们管那种东西叫小孩
We call those children.

428
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,610
人不应该养宠物
No man should have a pet.

429
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,390
不仅奇怪  而且不对
It's weird. And wrong.

430
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,170
-那是...食物  -不  求你了
- It's... food! - No, no, please!

431
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,040
不是它  是它
Not that. That!

432
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,120
食物能解决任何问题
Food fixes everything.

433
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,280
好了  进入狩猎状态
All right, show me your hunting face.

434
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,770
不是你  你还在禁闭中
Not you! You're still grounded.

435
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,990
来吧  桑克
Come on, Thunk.

436
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,550
我的脚好痛
My feet hurt.

437
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,210
-你看着很紧张  -我没有
- You look tense. - I'm not tense.

438
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,500
想要被"狩猎"的愤怒女孩
Angry girl who wants to be doing what they're doing.

439
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,760
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

440
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,890
坚持住  桑克  我来了
Hang on, Thunk. I'm coming.

441
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,340
你干吗追着我不放
Why are you doing this?

442
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,240
-他们在干嘛  -狩猎
- What are they doing? - Hunting.

443
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,800
离我远点
You stay away from me!

444
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,210
不  说真的  他们在干嘛
No, seriously, what are they doing?

445
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,500
你有那么多蛋  再生一个不行吗
You're got a ton of eggs. Just make another egg!

446
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,720
你这是落井下石
Now you're just rubbing it in.

447
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,540
来  谁想要吃蝎子
There. Who is hungry for scorpion?

448
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,530
那只鸟和那颗蛋怎么了
What happened to the egg and the bird?

449
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,030
没抓住  可是
You know, we lost 'em. But,

450
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,360
那只鸟踩在我身上
when the bird stepped on me

451
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,990
把我推到在地的时候
and pushed me into the ground,

452
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,460
这只蝎子给我垫背了
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me,

453
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,560
塞翁失马焉知非福
and you know, one thing led to another

454
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,810
所以他就成了我们的盘中餐
and here we are, eating him.

455
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,720
-一箭双雕  -不够吃
- So, win-win. - Not enough.

456
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,800
不够啊  我还要吃
Not enough. I need more.

457
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,520
我还要
I need more!

458
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,640
你们看她
Oh, look at that.

459
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,640
她不会真吃掉我吧
She's not gonna eat me, right?

460
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,700
你身上没肉
You're too skinny.

461
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,050
她要吃也是吃...
If she was going to eat anyone, it would be...

462
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,900
妈呀  她死活不松口
Mom! She locked her jaw!

463
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,390
走开  你个老不死的变态
Stay away! You sick old monster!

464
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,980
快点  把棍子塞进她嘴里
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

465
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,070
稳住她  用石头
Hold her still. Use a rock.

466
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,880
你能直接敲她腿吗
Would you just hit her legs?

467
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,790
你怎么滚到这里来了
Why are you rolling away?

468
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,220
我只是想找吃的
I just want something to eat!

469
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,620
不是有虫子吃吗  那么多
You had bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

470
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,110
拜托  我会让你帮我狩猎
Please! I'll let you help me hunt.

471
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,970
真的吗
Really?

472
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,460
别管我了
Don't wait on me!

473
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,230
记得宣传我生前事迹
Tell my story.

474
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,030
行了
Okay.

475
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,060
-这个叫什么  -陷阱
- What do you call this? - A trap.

476
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,970
-这干什么的  -看着
- What is the deal? - Well...

477
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,310
你一个人过多久了
How long have you been alone?

478
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,820
那我们要做什么
So what do we do?

479
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,410
你的演技如何
How's your acting?

480
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,820
你很擅长这个啊
You're good at this.

481
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,840
不对  抱歉  不是  就这样
No, Sorry. No. Okay.

482
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,990
不好意思
Excuse me.

483
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,850
那是我的手臂  是...
That's my arm! That's...

484
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,070
好  我拿出来
Okay, I'm moving it...

485
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,900
它没踩到你设的陷阱
It didn't step on your trap-y thing.

486
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,130
是  我发现了
Yeah, I noticed!

487
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,890
小伊去哪儿了
Where's Eep?

488
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,090
她好厉害
She's awesome.

489
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,460
小伊
Eep!

490
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,080
老爸  别
Dad, no!

491
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,740
真是一顿饕餮大餐
It's an avalanche of flavor!

492
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
看样子是不会剩了
Looks like we won't have any leftovers.

493
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,530
剩是什么意思
What are leftovers?

494
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,930
食物太多吃不完
You know, when you have so much food to eat,

495
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,000
就是剩了
you have some left over.

496
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
我们从来都没弄到过那么多食物
Well, we never have that much food.

497
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,350
阿瓜  来讲个故事吧
Grug, how about a story?

498
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,460
这主意不错  有人要听故事吗
That's a good idea. How about a story, huh?

499
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,280
太好了  快给我们讲故事吧
Yeah, a story! Tell us a story!

500
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,520
很久以前  有只小老虎
Once upon a time, there was a little tiger

501
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,360
和家人住在山洞里
who lived in a cave with her family.

502
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,750
家里有很多规矩
There were a lot of rules,

503
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,880
但最重要最简单的一条就是
but the big, simple one was

504
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,900
晚上不准离开山洞
to never leave the cave at night.

505
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,690
她家的门十分沉重
And the door was so heavy,

506
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,690
还以为这样就能让她记住了
you think it would be easy to remember.

507
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,310
-确实很容易记住  -可不是
- So easy to remember. - I know.

508
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,760
但是当大家都睡着了以后
But while everyone was asleep,

509
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,260
她还是跑出去了
she went out anyway.

510
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,930
-不是吧  -还真是
- No! - Yes!

511
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,850
她前脚刚走  她家的山洞就被毁了
And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed

512
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,700
全家人只得走上这长长的恼人旅程
and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk,

513
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,420
路上还碰到了一个怪人
with some weirdo they met,

514
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,530
然后
and...

515
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,760
死了
died!

516
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:39,990
讲完了
The end.

517
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,390
我没想到会这样结束
I did not see that coming,

518
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,060
结局太反转了
twist ending.

519
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,750
我的故事是不会就这样潦草结束的
My stories never end like that.

520
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,990
太好了  一晚上俩故事
Yes! Two stories in one night!

521
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,030
好吧  但没有阿瓜的那么精彩
Okay, but it won't be as good as Grug's.

522
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,170
很久以前  有只美丽的老虎
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger.

523
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,290
她和家人住在一个山洞里
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family.

524
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,370
她爸妈说
Her father and mother told her:

525
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,430
你想去哪儿就去哪儿
"You may go anywhere you want,

526
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,100
但千万不要靠近悬崖
but never go near the cliff,

527
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,180
不然会掉下去
for you could fall."

528
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,610
摔死  这故事真好
And die. Good story.

529
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,090
但她趁没人注意的时候
But when no one was looking,

530
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,390
跑到了悬崖边
she go near the cliff,

531
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,190
越靠近悬崖
for the closer she came to the edge,

532
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,690
她听到的越多
the more she could hear,

533
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,450
看到的越多
the more she could see,

534
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,450
感受到的也就越多
and the more she could feel.

535
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,910
最后她站在悬崖边
Finally she stood at the very edge,

536
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,340
看见了一道光
and she saw a light.

537
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,510
她探身去触碰
She leaned out to touch it,

538
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,280
但脚下一滑
and she slipped.

539
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,850
掉了下去
And she fell.

540
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,030
然后她飞了起来
And she flew.

541
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,020
她飞去了哪里
Where did she fly?

542
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,740
-明天  -明天?
- Tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

543
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,980
在那里  天空中的星星多得数不清
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.

544
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,420
那会很明亮啊
It would be so bright.

545
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,260
那里不像今天亦或昨天
A place not like today, or yesterday.

546
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,370
那里的一切都更美好
A place where things are better.

547
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,590
明天又不是个地方
Tomorrow isn't a place.

548
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,790
它是...是...是...
It's... It's... It's...

549
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,260
是看不见的  
You can't see it!

550
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,100
能看到的  我看见过
Oh, yes, yes it is. I've seen it.

551
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,510
那就是我要去的地方
That's where I'm going.

552
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,550
行了  该去睡觉了
Well, we are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

553
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,520
醒了以后  我们就去找
And when we wake up, we're going to find

554
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,660
找那个什么都有的地方
the place that has everything we want.

555
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,670
-找"明天"吗  -找山洞
- Tomorrow? - A cave.

556
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,100
太险了  我们差点就死了
That was too close. It almost caught us.

557
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,020
有我看着呢  没事
I was watching. We were fine.

558
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,220
反正我们得快点走了
Well, we're got to move faster.

559
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,520
你们能别一直用徘徊的速度吗
You people have any other speed aside from wander?

560
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,670
怎么着也得达到散步的速度吧
I'll take a shamble, at this point.

561
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,610
你有时间吗
Hey, do you have a minute?

562
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,850
那只老虎是怎么飞的
How did the tiger fly?

563
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,380
把我放出来我才会说
I only share when I'm outside the log.

564
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,810
那样我才有激情
I'm funny that way.

565
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,440
看我的吧
Leave this to me.

566
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,970
桑克  你脸上有只蜘蛛
Hey, Thunk, you have a spider on your face.

567
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,390
他跑掉了
He's loose!

568
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,870
别去踩那些奇怪的尖石头
Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks!

569
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,070
你是说这些石头吗
You mean these rocks?

570
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,120
千万不要踩  
Do not step on these rocks!

571
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,800
走开  娘炮
Step aside, girl.

572
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,970
喂  为什么没人肯听我的
Hello? Is that... nobody's listening!

573
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,230
都没长耳朵吗  根本没法在上面走路
No one is listening! You cannot walk on those!

574
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,550
回来  马上给我回来
Get back here, get back here now!

575
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,690
我们的救星跑掉了
Well, there goes our chance for survival.

576
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,290
木头也没了
And our log!

577
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,440
好吧
Okay!

578
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,580
跳着走也不行  能好一点
Jumping doesn't help. I mean, just briefly,

579
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,950
但还是很疼的
but it doesn't get any better!

580
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,810
行了  不要用爬的
Okay. Do not walk on your hands.

581
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,580
爬着走也不行
The hands do not help at all!

582
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,430
我可以帮忙
I can help you,

583
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,360
但我们的规矩
but we're going to have to make

584
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
得改改了
a few changes around here.

585
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,000
不准把我装在木头里了  把它扔掉
The log ride is over. Drop the log.

586
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,400
现在把它踢走
Now kick it away.

587
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,740
踢远点儿
Farther.

588
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,740
玩真的
Really?

589
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,650
行了  聪明的...盖伊
Okay, smart... Guy.

590
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,230
现在要怎样
Now what?

591
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,170
乖乖鱼  乖乖鱼
Good fish, good fish.

592
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,480
好了  现在可以看了
Okay, now you can look.

593
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,890
爱死了
I love them!

594
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,030
-我的脚呢  -还在呢
- But where are my feet? - They're still there.

595
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,120
那好
Okay.

596
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,860
-你好重啊  -真的吗
- You're really heavy. - Really?

597
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,530
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

598
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,290
等等
Hey, hey wait, wait!

599
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,860
行了  她起来了
Okay, she's up.

600
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,810
我们都没事  没事了
We're good. I'm good.

601
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,590
这些鞋子太棒了  你怎么想到的
Oh, these shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas?

602
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,770
这个叫做大脑
I'm calling it a brain.

603
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,190
想法都是从这里产生的
I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.

604
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,760
爸  我没有大脑
Dad, I don't have a brain.

605
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,750
就算没有大脑  我们也生活得很好
We've gotten along just fine without brains until now.

606
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,770
原始人不需要大脑
Cavemen don't need brains.

607
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,420
有这些就够了
We have these.

608
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,560
就是这样  懦夫才会诡计多端
That's I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings!

609
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,860
现在  让我们朝那座山迈进吧
Now let's get to that Mountain.

610
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,710
这鞋子太棒了
Oh, wow, I love those.

611
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,700
乖乖鱼  别吃我的脚脚
Good fish, don't eat my feet.

612
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,430
老虎到底是怎么飞的
So, how did the tiger fly?

613
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,080
她跳上了太阳
She jumped on the sun,

614
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,070
骑着它到了明天
and rode it to Tomorrow.

615
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,800
不不不
No, no, no, no!

616
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,890
老爸你好
Hi, Dad!

617
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,520
老爸再见
Bye, Dad.

618
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,330
你们之前见过雨吧  
You've seen rain before, right?

619
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,600
我们很少出门的
We don't get out much.

620
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,360
小伊  这个看着不安全
Eep, looks dangerous.

621
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,080
老爸  你看什么都危险
Dad, you say that about everything.

622
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,750
-当心  -是吗  那好吧
- Careful. - Oh, really? Okay.

623
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,510
不不不  不可以  不可以
No, no, no! Not cool! Not cool!

624
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,690
不可以
Not cool!

625
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,360
那只熊说  你的洞吗
The bear says: "Your cave?

626
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,780
我从上周开始就把自己的骨头扔在这了
I've been dumping my bones here since last week."

627
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,120
这故事很有趣
That's a funny story!

628
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,520
这不是故事  是笑话
It's not a story, it's a joke.

629
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,000
笑话是什么
What's a joke?

630
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,400
就是瞎编出来
You know, just making something up,

631
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,260
让人发笑的东西
to make you laugh.

632
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,480
-拿着  给你一个  -谢谢
- Here you go. One for you. - Thanks.

633
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,210
给你一个  还有一个给你
One for you, and this one's for you...

634
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,110
行了行了  够了
Okay. Okay. That's enough.

635
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,740
为什么孩子们也要每人拿一个海螺
I don't see why the kids need their own shells.

636
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,750
如果有人出事了
So if anyone gets in trouble,

637
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,910
就用这个呼叫其他人
we can call the others.

638
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,670
等下  你是说我们要分头行动吗
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

639
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,550
这样就能同时尝试多条路径了
We can try more paths at once.

640
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,050
这是最快捷有效的方式
It's the fastest way through.

641
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,180
克鲁德一家永远不分离
The Croods stick together.

642
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,650
你的方法不安全
Your way isn't safe.

643
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,060
-他们可以  -我们可以  老爸  
- They can handle it. -We can do it, Dad.

644
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,100
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

645
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,120
保护你们的安全是我的责任
It's my job to keep you safe.

646
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,100
这里还是我说了算
 I'm still in charge,

647
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,290
我们不能分开
and we are not splitting up.

648
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,870
不过你俩可以
Except for you two.

649
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,370
就这么决定了
And that's final.

650
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,310
人呢  人呢  你们都还好吧
Hello? Hello? Is everyone all right?

651
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,420
我们没事  阿瓜  
We're okay, Grug!

652
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,700
老爸  我有点害怕
Dad, I'm freaking out a little bit.

653
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,730
告诉我该怎么做
Just tell me what to do.

654
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,290
我现在要怎么办  怎么办
Just what do I do? What do I do right now?

655
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,410
原地不动  我会找到你的
Stay where you are! I'll find you.

656
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:48,190
不  太慢了
No! Too slow.

657
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,190
所有人都往前走  我们会走出去的
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.

658
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,170
老爸
Dad?

659
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,110
是的  好吧
Yeah. Okay.

660
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,160
记住  千万不要害怕
Remember, never not be afraid.

661
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,720
你可以的
You can do this!

662
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,060
没事的  没事的
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay.

663
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,950
我要晕过去了
I'm gonna pass out.

664
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,650
仙蒂 仙蒂
Sandy! Sandy!

665
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,190
再给我一朵
Give me another one.

666
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,550
你掉东西了
You dropped these.

667
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,240
跟我走
Come with me.

668
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,100
狗狗  抓住它
Here, boy, catch!

669
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,280
外婆
Gran?

670
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,160
妈
Mom?

671
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,140
阿瓜
Grug?

672
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,680
我去接他
I'll go get him.

673
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,790
好狗狗  谁是我的好狗狗
Good boy. Who's my good boy?

674
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,930
是你  就是你  看看你
You are. Yes, you are. Look at you.

675
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,640
想要个名字吗  给你取个名字吧
You need a name? You want a name?

676
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,590
就叫你道格拉斯吧
I'm going to call you Douglas.

677
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,170
你能做动作吗
Can you do tricks?

678
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,150
翻身
Roll over.

679
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,770
来  道格拉斯  翻身
Come on, Douglas. Roll over.

680
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,890
好狗狗  道格拉斯
Good boy, Douglas!

681
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,910
我曾经爱上过一个猎人
I was in love once. He was a hunter.

682
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,510
而我是食物收集者
I was a gatherer.

683
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,930
在当时算是件丑闻
It was quite a scandal.

684
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,290
我们喂对方吃浆果  一起跳舞
We fed each other berries. We danced.

685
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,950
然后我爸用石头把他捶成肉泥
Then my father smashed him with a rock,

686
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,980
又把我卖给了你外公
and traded me to your grandfather.

687
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,590
大伙  都下来
Croods, get down here!

688
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,440
阿瓜  他们没事
Grug, they're okay.

689
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,390
有盖伊在呢
Guy's with them.

690
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,340
有盖伊在  好吧
Oh, Guy's with them. Oh, Okay.

691
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,950
那还真是感谢  
Well, thank you,

692
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,900
谢谢你告诉我关于盖伊的有趣近况
thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update.

693
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,100
好了  我要上去了
Okay. I'm gonna go up.

694
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,790
一起上去吧
Why don't you join us

695
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,690
你就别再拖累大家了
when you stop being a big drag.

696
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,380
来抱团睡觉吧
Sleep pile?

697
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,530
有人听故事吗
How about a story, huh?

698
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,420
有人吗
Anyone?

699
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:46,690
索科说  "知道  是我画的"
Then Thork said: "Know it, I drew it."

700
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,240
我知道你带着我们走挺麻烦的  但是
I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but...

701
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,220
这些天是他们生命中最多彩的日子
they had the best day in their lives.

702
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,710
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

703
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,200
我带你们看样东西
I wanna show you something.

704
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,210
数都数不清的太阳
More suns in the sky than you can count.

705
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:13,490
每一颗横跨天空的星星都会在那里休息
Every sun that crosses our sky comes to rest up there.

706
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:17,480
-明天  -就是可以安身的地方
- Tomorrow. - That's where we'll be safe.

707
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,300
我要跟盖伊一起走  
I'm going with Guy.

708
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,170
不  不要带走我的女儿
No, not my little girl.

709
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,950
跟我们一起走吧
Come with us.

710
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,570
我不能扔下阿瓜
I can't go without Grug.

711
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:34,340
那你就自己留下吧  我要去
Well, that makes one of us. Count me in.

712
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,560
你说真的  妈妈
Really? Mom?

713
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,460
阿瓜根本不知道怎么保护我们
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

714
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,690
他压根就没主意
In fact, he has no ideas at all.

715
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,600
不会吧  那次他不就...
No. That's not true. What about that one time he...

716
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,280
-他... -面对现实吧
- He... - Oh, face it.

717
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,010
他要能想出个原创的主意
If he actually had an idea of his own,

718
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:53,200
我就算心肌梗死也值了
I'd have a heart attack and die!

719
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,880
-阿瓜  -老爸  老爸
- Grug? - Dad? Dad?

720
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,160
他那么大块头  怎么就人间蒸发了呢
He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that.

721
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:08,110
问问这个丑娘们儿看没看见老爸
Hey, wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen Dad.

722
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,210
没看见哟
I haven't seen him.

723
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,800
-你在干吗  -我一宿没合眼
- What are you doing? - Yeah. I was up all night.

724
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,960
因为我才思泉涌
All these ideas kept coming to me.

725
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,890
-那是蛇吗  -皮带蛇  升级加强版
- Is that a snake? - Belt! New and improved!

726
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,210
还有自动束腰功能
It's even self-tightening.

727
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,120
你头上那是什么
What's that on your head?

728
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,360
我看叫孤注一掷
It's called desperation.

729
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,860
这叫假发  跟阿瓜谐音
I call it a 'rug'. Rhymes with Grug.

730
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:38,370
这个叫作坐骑  也跟阿瓜谐音
And this one. I call it a 'ride'. Rhymes with Grug.

731
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,140
并不谐音啊
That doesn't rhyme.

732
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,630
坐这个可比鞋快多了
It's gonna get us places faster than shoes.

733
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:45,300
来吧  别掉队哦
Yeah! Try to keep up!

734
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,520
我也想有个坐骑
I wish I had a 'ride'.

735
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,270
绘画已经过时了
Painting is a thing of the past.

736
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,360
我给这个起名叫快照
I call this a 'snapshot'.

737
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,320
再来一次  我好像眨眼了
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

738
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,090
这叫墨镜
I call them 'shades'.

739
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,270
阳光不再刺眼啦
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

740
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,980
你哪来的这些好主意
Where do you get these great ideas?

741
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,550
我没有大脑
Since I don't have a brain,

742
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,980
这都是从我胃里出来的
they're coming from my stomach,

743
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,530
在深处发酵  再反刍到我的思想里
down deep below, and then up again into my mind.

744
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,290
阿瓜  该出发了
Grug, we have to keep moving.

745
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,970
我有点子哦  也有思想
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

746
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,410
像这个  我叫它活动房屋
Like this. I call it a 'mobile home'.

747
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,320
棒吧
Isn't that something?

748
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,460
-这个叫升降梯  -老妈
- I'm calling this one a 'lifterator'. - Mom?

749
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,260
我懂的  太烂了
I know. It's bad.

750
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,550
我差点儿就要心疼他了
I almost feel sorry for him.

751
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,510
一点也不心疼
No, I don't.

752
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,760
阿瓜  你想干吗
What are you trying to do, Grug?

753
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:57,020
我以为我要是能像盖伊那样有主意
I thought if I could have ideas like Guy,

754
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,320
没准小伊就会听我的话了
maybe Eep would listen to me.

755
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,350
也许她就不会想跟盖伊走了
Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.

756
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,240
阿瓜  你就是为了这个吗
Oh, Grug. Is that what this is all about?

757
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,840
我还以为这样能干掉你老妈  所以
And I also thought it would kill your mother, so...

758
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,720
你懂的  双赢
you know, win-win.

759
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,720
我们到了
We're here!

760
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,280
那有个洞  大家快进去
Cave! Everyone inside! Come on!

761
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,500
快点儿  快走快走
Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!

762
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,560
不
No!

763
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,170
-阿瓜  别再往洞里躲了  -你说啥
- No more caves, Grug. - What?

764
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,150
我们要乘着太阳和盖伊一起去明天
We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.

765
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,670
等等  你们都要去吗
Wait, wait, so you're all going to do this?

766
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,990
-桑克?  -对不起  老爸
- Thunk? - Sorry, Dad.

767
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,590
别再为我们操心了
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

768
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,420
这是我的职责  操心费力  循规蹈矩
It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules.

769
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,390
规矩在这儿不好使了
The rules don't work out here!

770
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,640
是规矩让我们活了下来
They kept us alive!

771
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,560
那不是活着  那只是
That wasn't living, that was just...

772
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,450
苟且偷生  不一样的
Not dying. There's a difference.

773
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,240
乌格  大家听着  你们得听我讲
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me!

774
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,730
要是听了你的  我们早就死了
We'd be dead now if we'd listened to you!

775
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,820
我们必须跟着盖伊走
We have to follow Guy now.

776
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,920
-盖伊 -盖伊  快跑
- Guy? - Guy, run!

777
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,750
这样毫无意义  我们时间不多了
This is pointless! We've running out of time!

778
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:09,620
世界就要崩塌了
Everything is collapsing.

779
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,890
你失去理智的话会适得其反的
You are being irrational and counterproductive.

780
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,560
别跟我拽词儿
Big words anger me!

781
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,160
-接着说啊  -反击
- Keep talking! - Countermeasures!

782
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,370
还记得今早你什么样吗
Remember how you were this morning?

783
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,270
你变了  记得吗
You changed, remember?

784
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,170
你是智者  是现代人了
Idea man? Modern man?

785
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,040
-我是原始人  -别过来  等等
- I am a caveman! - No, no, no, wait!

786
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,680
这是什么  害得我打不到你
No! What is this stuff that's saving you from my punches?

787
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,410
-是焦油  -不
- Tar. - No!

788
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,100
-求求你  -不  我得回到她们身边
- Please. - No! I have to get back to them!

789
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,590
别动了
You have to stop.

790
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,260
-别挣扎  -不
- Stop struggling! - No!

791
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,610
阿瓜  别动
Grug, stop!

792
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:12,800
没人能挣脱焦油  相信我
No one gets out of this. Believe me.

793
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:14,910
我知道
I know.

794
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,560
-你的  -全家
- Your? - Family.

795
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,530
对不起
Sorry.

796
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,510
当时我还很小
I was little when it happened.

797
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,270
父母留给我的最后一句话是
The last thing my parents told me was:

798
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,750
别东躲西藏  勇敢的活着
"Don't hide. Live.

799
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:47,290
跟着太阳走  你就会到达明天
Follow the sun. You'll make it to Tomorrow."

800
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:54,880
你追求光明  我女儿很像你
You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.

801
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,480
不  他像你
No. She's like you.

802
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,110
她爱你  却总是忘记说出口
She loves you but always forgets to say it,

803
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,280
就像你也总是忘记向她表露心声
just like you forget to tell her.

804
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:11,350
也许因为我总是忙着保护他们
I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.

805
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,200
我理解  这是父亲的责任
It's okay. That's what dads do.

806
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,640
没错  但是我们要先离开这里
That's right, and we can't do that from here.

807
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,650
我们需要你的主意
We need one of your ideas.

808
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,950
来吧  你行的
Come on, you can do it.

809
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:43,780
皮带猴  启动紧急创意生成机
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate.

810
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,150
有主意了
I've got it.

811
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,050
我懂  不过
Yeah. I know, but,

812
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:58,400
它已经尽力了  开始吧
he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go.

813
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,370
它来了
There he is.

814
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,230
皮带猴  来段浪漫生动又真挚的音乐
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

815
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,080
要打动我哦
Move me.

816
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,590
它看到我们了  好戏上演了  开始
Okay, he sees us! That's our cue. Now work it!

817
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,600
它不过来
He's not coming over.

818
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:32,290
可能咱们的人偶不够惊恐
I don't think out puppet looks scared enough.

819
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,830
惊恐  我给你来个惊恐的
Scared? I'll show you scared!

820
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,940
把琴槌给我
Hand me those acting sticks!

821
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,430
抓紧了
Hold on!

822
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,290
你成功了
Yes! You did it!

823
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,490
-阿瓜 -爸爸
- Grug! - Dad!

824
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,780
我们没事
We're okay!

825
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,580
我们很好
Yeah. We're okay.

826
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,990
阿瓜  听你的
Grug, your call.

827
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,420
带我们去明天吧
Take us to Tomorrow.

828
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:04,250
快点  加油  我们要到了
Hurry! Come on! We're gonna make it!

829
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,150
-你说的都是真的  -那就是了
- You were right! - There... There it is!

830
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:12,970
太阳在那儿  我们能乘着它去明天了
The sun! We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow.

831
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:38,560
快跑
Run!

832
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,170
我...我不明白
I don't... I don't understand.

833
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:12,040
太阳就在这儿  刚刚还在这儿呀
The sun was right here! It was right here!

834
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,520
快回到洞里去  快
We have to go back to the cave! Hurry.

835
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,910
快快  别跑散了
Hurry, hurry, stay together!

836
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,160
别停下  快走快走
Let's keep moving. Move! Move, move!

837
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,680
大家抓住我的手  桑克
Everybody hold my hand! Thunk,

838
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,180
走走走  别分散
let's go! Go, go, go! Let's stay together!

839
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,890
阿瓜  你怎么了
Let's... Grug, what's wrong with you?

840
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,000
阿瓜  在这里会死的
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

841
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,690
阿瓜  听我说  我们得回到洞里
Grug, listen to me! We have to get back to that cave.

842
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,260
不要黑暗  不再躲藏
No more dark. No more hiding.

843
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,020
不要再进洞穴了
No more caves.

844
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,210
这一切都是为了什么
What's the point of all this?

845
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,700
追逐光明
To follow the light.

846
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,110
我无法改变自己  我也没有主意
I can't change, I don't have ideas,

847
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,470
但是我有蛮力
but I have my strength.

848
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:38,120
现在你们需要的就是蛮力
And right now that's all you need.

849
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:42,020
不  我们对那边一无所知
No! We don't know what's over there!

850
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,240
那边也许什么都没有  太冒险了
Maybe nothing. It's too risky!

851
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,740
这是个机会
It's a chance.

852
01:15:58,370 --> 01:15:59,770
我愿意试试
I'll take that chance.

853
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:05,990
从我一见到你  就想把你扔出去
You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.

854
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:10,210
-你在开玩笑吧  -玩笑是什么
- That's a joke, right? - What's a joke?

855
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,300
他成功了
He made it!

856
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,640
他成功了
He made it.

857
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,080
桑克  该你了
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

858
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,970
你是不是要自己留下来
You're not coming, are you?

859
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,900
你到了那边  我也就到了
When you make it, so will I.

860
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,030
你真棒
You did good.

861
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,950
老爸
Daddy.

862
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,620
-奶...-别废话  快扔吧
- Gran... - No mush, just throw me.

863
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,830
等下  你今天让我刮目相看  傻孩子
Wait! You surprised me today. Lunkhead.

864
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,650
我还活着
Still alive!

865
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,460
-该你了  -不  我有好多话想说
- Time to go. - No! I have too much to say to you.

866
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,370
我想弥补一切  却没有时间了
I need to fix everything, and I don't have time.

867
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,850
我会弥补的
I can fix it.

868
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,180
感觉真好
This works good.

869
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:12,500
-这叫什么  -我考虑把它叫作拥抱
- What do you call it? - I was thinking of calling it a 'hug',

870
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,220
因为跟阿瓜谐音
because it rhymes with Grug.

871
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,790
不过你想叫它别的也可以
But you can change it if you want.

872
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,510
不  我喜欢拥抱
No, no, I like hug.

873
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:30,890
我爱你
I love you.

874
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,650
我...
I...

875
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,390
老爸
Dad,

876
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:47,540
-我害怕  -永远不要恐惧
- I'm scared. - Never be afraid.

877
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,810
他在那儿  我看见了
There! I see him.

878
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,410
我成功了
Hey! I did it.

879
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,070
后退  后退
Stay back! Stay back!

880
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,050
他们有麻烦了  挺住  我来了
They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm coming!

881
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,150
我要怎么过去呢  好好想一想
How do I get across? I gotta think.

882
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,530
如果是盖伊会怎么做呢
What would Guy do? What would Guy do?

883
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,710
我会怎么做呢
What would I do?

884
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:44,020
拿着
Hold this.

885
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,760
我...有...
I... have...

886
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,110
主意啦
an... idea!

887
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,050
跑啊
Run!

888
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,100
道格拉斯  我认得那家伙
Douglas! Hey, I know that guy!

889
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:59,450
抓紧了
Hold on!

890
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,380
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

891
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:47,890
我去和她说吧
I'll tell her.

892
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,950
我还没来得及告诉他
I've never had to tell him.

893
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,630
小伊  要是你老爸在  他会让你...
Eep, if your dad were here, he would tell you to...

894
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,810
快让开
Get out of the way!

895
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:49,150
你学得可真像
Wow, you sound just like him.

896
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:52,420
快让开
Get out of the way!

897
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,640
-老爸  -他成功了
- Daddy! - He did it!

898
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:57,300
他乘着太阳
He's riding the sun,

899
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,510
-不过技术不太好  -快都闪开
- but not very well. - Everybody out of the way!

900
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,390
阿瓜
Grug!

901
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:12,590
危险在哪儿  谁吹的号
Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?

902
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,890
我也爱你
I love you, too!

903
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,370
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four,

904
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:33,040
五  六...
five, six, and...

905
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:33,880
七
seven.

906
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:37,850
七个半
And a half.

907
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,250
八个
And eight.

908
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,990
-九个  -道格拉斯  老爸  你救了它
- Nine. - Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

909
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,300
男孩总得养个宠物吧
Well, boy's got to have a pet.

910
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,940
没想到我还是个爱猫男士
Turns out I'm a cat person.

911
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:57,700
不可以
No!

912
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:09,660
你们快来看啊
You really need to see this.

913
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,240
我们去那里吧
We should go there.

914
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:26,170
太棒了  我们来了
Yes! Coming through!

915
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,990
这就是我  我是小伊
This is me. My name is Eep.

916
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,290
这是我们一家  克鲁德一家
And this is my family, the Croods.

917
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,160
我们晒日光浴  也养宠物  
If you weren't clued by sunbathes and pets,

918
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:46,590
我们不再是原始人了
we're not exactly cavemen anymore.

919
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,140
再来一次  我好像眨眼了
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

920
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,170
世界依然艰辛险恶
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile.

921
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,820
但我们对未来充满信心
But now we know the Croods will make it,

922
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:05,170
我们打破了那曾禁锢我们于黑暗的规矩
because we changed the rules. The ones that kept us in the dark.

923
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,080
也因为我的老爸
And because of my dad,

924
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,960
他让我们明白人是会改变的
who taught us that anyone could change.

925
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,130
放出宝宝
Release the baby!

926
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:19,940
多少变了点儿吧
Well, sort of.

927
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:41,990
从今往后  我们将在外面的世界生活
So from now on, we'll stay out here,

928
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,430
并在这里追逐光明
where we can follow the light.
