1
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,720
快过来
Hey! Come here!

2
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,600
马上就来
I'm on my way.

3
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,190
他已经神志不清了 但还是指名要见你

4
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,130
把他带进来

5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,570
他身上只带了这个...

6
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,230
还有这个

7
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,530
你是来杀我的吗
Are you here to kill me?

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,710
我知道这是什么
I know what this is.

9
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,880
很久很久以前
I've seen one before.

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,950
我就见过这个
Many,many years ago.

11
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,760
记得我做过一个梦
It belonged to a man I met

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,450
那个模糊的梦里就有这东西
in a half-remembered dream.

13
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,560
那个人满脑子都是些疯狂的念头
A man possessed of some radical notions.

14
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,300
寄生你体内的什么东西最顽强
What is the most resilient parasite?

15
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,940
细菌 病毒
A bacteria? A virus?

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,770
还是蛔虫
An intestinal worm?

17
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,140
柯布先生的意思是说...
Uh...What Mr. Cobb is trying to say

18
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,510
一个想法
An idea.

19
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,310
顽强无比 感染性极强
Resilient. Highly contagious.

20
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,740
一旦有一个想法占据了你的大脑
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,

21
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,490
那就很难再去摆脱它了
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,700
经过充分思考 理解消化
An idea that is fully formed,fully understood,

23
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,190
当这个想法完全成型以后
that sticks.

24
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,590
就会永远根植在那里
Right in there somewhere.

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,330
然后你们就可以偷走它
For someone like you to steal?

26
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,430
是的 你做梦的时候 你的防备意识也沉睡了
Yes. In the dream state,your conscious defenses are lowered...

27
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,030
如此一来你的想法很容易被偷走
and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,430
这就叫做盗梦
It's called extraction.

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,170
斋藤先生 我们完全可以训练你的潜意识进行自我防御
Mr. Saito,we can train your subconscious to defend itself...

30
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,840
就算最出色的盗梦者也无计可施
from even the most skilled extractor.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,170
你凭什么能做到
How can you do that?

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,180
因为我就是最出色的盗梦者
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,170
我能窥探你的想法 找出你大脑里的所有秘密
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets.

34
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,050
我精通其中窍门
I know the tricks.

35
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,150
我可以教你 这样即使睡着了
And I can teach them to you,so that even when you're asleep...

36
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,650
你的潜意识也不会放松警惕
your defense is never down.

37
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,030
如果 想让我教你
Look,if you want my help,

38
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,460
就得完全信任我 对我毫无保留
you're gonna have to be completely open with me.

39
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,000
我得比你的妻子、心理医生
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...

40
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,460
比任何人 都更了解你的想法
better than your therapist,better than anyone.

41
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,570
比如你的梦里有个装满秘密的保险箱
If this is a dream,and you have a safe full of secrets...

42
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,070
我必须知道里面是什么
I need to know what's in that safe.

43
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,710
为了达到效果 你的大脑必须完全对我开放
In order for this all to work,you need to completely let me in.

44
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,960
两位请慢用
Enjoy your evening,gentlemen,

45
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,220
我会考虑看看的
as I consider your proposal.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
他知道了
He knows.

47
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,220
上面一层怎么了
What's going on up there?

48
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,080
斋藤都知道了 他在耍我们
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

49
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,810
别担心 我会搞定 相信我
Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.

50
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,480
情报就在保险箱里
The information is in the safe.

51
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,820
我提到秘密的时候 他就盯着保险箱看
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.

52
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,220
她怎么来了
What's she doing here?

53
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,030
你先回房 剩下的就交给我了
Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.

54
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,230
别忘了 我们是来做正事的
Okay,make sure you do. We're here to work.

55
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,340
从这跳下去 还能活得了吗
If I jumped,would I survive?

56
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,110
运气好的话还行
With a clean dive,perhaps.

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,950
茉儿 你来这干嘛
Mal,what are you doing here?

58
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,320
我以为你会想我的
I thought you might be missing me.

59
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,750
我当然想你
You know that I am.

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,790
不过我再也不敢相信你了
But I can't trust you anymore.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,890
所以呢
So what?

62
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,660
一看就像是亚瑟的品味
Looks like Arthur's taste.

63
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,470
我们这次的目标对战后的英国画家很感兴趣
Actually,the subject is partial to postwar British painters.

64
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,870
请坐吧
Please,have a seat.

65
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,040
告诉我
Tell me...

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,010
孩子们有没有想我
do the children miss me?

67
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,150
想到你无法想象
You can't imagine.

68
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,320
你要干什么
What are you doing?

69
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,030
出去透透气
Just getting some fresh air.

70
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,190
你坐那别动  茉儿
Stay where you are,Mal.

71
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,740
天 该死
God,damn it.

72
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,170
转过身来
Turn around.

73
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,480
道姆 把枪放下
The gun,Dom.

74
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,790
快点
Please.

75
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,270
那个信封 物归原主吧  柯布先生
Now the envelope,Mr. Cobb.

76
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,070
她告诉你的 还是你早就知道了
Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?

77
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,480
知道你是是个小偷 还是 知道我们其实在梦里
That you're here to steal from me,or that we are actually asleep?

78
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,980
我想知道是谁雇你们来的
I want to know the name of your employer.

79
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,890
在梦里你拿个枪威胁他 有什么用  茉儿
Ah,there's no use threatening him in a dream,right,Mal?

80
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,490
那得看你怎么威胁了
That depends on what you're threatening.

81
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,560
杀了他只会让他醒过来
Killing him would just wake him up.

82
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,500
不过呢 疼痛...
But pain...

83
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,330
他大脑会感受到疼痛
Pain is in the mind.

84
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,340
从场景布局来看 
And judging by the decor,

85
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,240
我们是在你的梦里吧 亚瑟
we're in your mind,aren't we,Arthur?

86
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,260
搞什么 你醒得太早了 
What are you doing? It's too soon.

87
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,760
我知道 梦境已经崩溃
I know. But the dream's collapsing.

88
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,290
我要想办法让斋藤多在那多呆一会
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer.

89
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,560
就快得手了
We're almost there.

90
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,540
好险 他差点就得手了
He was close. Very close.

91
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,430
拦住他
Stop him!

92
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,420
没戏了 把他叫醒
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

93
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,180
叫不醒啊
He won't wake.

94
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,380
机密

95
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,000
-让他坠落 -什么
- Give him the kick. - What?

96
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,520
把他推水里
Dunk him.

97
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,430
他昏过去了
He's out.

98
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,800
你是有备而来啊
You came prepared,hmm?

99
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,670
连我的高级保镖都不知道这
Not even my head of security knows this apartment.

100
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,810
你怎么找着的
How did you find it?

101
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,760
像你这种地位的男人
It's difficult for a man of your position

102
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,180
想金屋藏娇 可不容易啊
to keep a love nest like this secret...

103
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,880
尤其你的情妇还是有夫之妇
particularly where there's a married woman involved.

104
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,120
-不可能  -但事实摆着 我们就在这了
- She would never... - Yet here we are.

105
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,190
-进退两难啊  -他们慢慢逼近了
- With a dilemma. - They're getting closer.

106
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,120
-你拿到了你想要的  -还没有
- You got what you came for. - Well,that's not true.

107
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,960
你把文件上的关键部分全划掉了
You left out a key piece of information,didn't you?

108
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,330
你有所保留是因为你知道我们是来干什么的  
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.

109
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,370
-但你为何还让我们进来  -算是一次面试
- Question is,why'd you let us in at all? - An audition.

110
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,500
-面试什么  -不重要了 你失败了
- An audition for what? - Doesn't matter. You failed.

111
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,370
我们把你脑袋里的信息偷出来了
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.

112
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,080
可你们的花招被我看穿了
But your deception was obvious.

113
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,780
好了 你们走吧
So leave me and go.

114
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,390
你没有搞清楚状况 斋藤先生
You don't seem to understand,Mr. Saito.

115
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,790
雇佣我们的公司  是可不允许我们失手的
That corporation that hired us,they won't accept failure.

116
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,190
我们活不过两天
We won't last two days.

117
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,230
柯布
Cobb?

118
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,540
看来我只能使用原始手段了
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.

119
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,660
把你知道的告诉我们 
Tell us what you know!

120
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,470
把知道的告诉我们 快
Tell us what you know,now!

121
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,710
我一直很讨厌这里的地毯
I've always hated this carpet.

122
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,250
因为它又旧又脏 连褪个色都与众不同
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.

123
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,090
不过好歹它是条羊毛毯子
But very definitely made of wool.

124
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,620
可这条...
Right now...

125
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,090
却是是涤纶的
I'm lying on polyester.

126
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,800
也就是说 我现在根本没有趴在自己公寓的地毯上
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet,in my apartment.

127
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,940
你果然名不虚传 柯布先生
You have lived up to your reputation,Mr. Cobb.

128
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,410
我现在依然在梦里
I'm still dreaming.

129
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,920
-进展如何  -不太妙
- How'd it go? - Not good.

130
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,430
梦中有梦 非常精彩
Dream within a dream,huh? I'm impressed.

131
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,200
但在我梦里 得由我说了算
But in my dream,you play by my rules.

132
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,630
这么说吧 斋藤先生...
Ah,yes,but you see,Mr. Saito...

133
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
我们不是在你的梦里
We're not in your dream.

134
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,940
而是在我的梦里
We're in mine.

135
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,980
你二啊 怎么会把地毯搞错的
Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?

136
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,450
-这不能怪我  -你可是筑梦师
- It wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.

137
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,750
又不是我把他揍到地上的
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

138
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,020
好了 够了
That's enough.

139
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,660
还有你 你是怎么回事
You. What the hell was all that?

140
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,030
-我控制住了局势  -你这就叫控制了
- I have it under control. - I'd hate to see you out of control.

141
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,970
没时间争论了 我要在京都下车
We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.

142
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,970
干嘛啊 他又不会检查每一节车厢
Why? He's not gonna check every compartment.

143
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,900
没错 但我不喜欢坐火车
Yeah,well,I don't like trains.

144
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,700
都听好 大家自求多福
Listen. Every man for himself.

145
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
喂 你好
Yes,hello?

146
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,880
-爸爸  -爸爸
- Hi,Daddy. - Hi,Dad.

147
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,020
嘿 小家伙们 你们好吗 过得怎样
Hey,guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing,huh?

148
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,420
-很好  -还行
- Good. - Okay,I guess.

149
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,330
还行 是谁说还行 是詹姆斯吗
Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you,James?

150
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,400
嗯 是我 爸爸 你什么时候回家
Yeah. When are you coming home,Dad?

151
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,720
现在还不行 亲爱的   
Well,I can't,sweetheart. I can't.

152
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
还需要一段时间  
Not for a while,remember?

153
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,540
为什么
Why?

154
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,450
我不是跟你们说过了吗  我在外面工作  
Look,I told you,I'm away because I'm working,right?

155
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,580
外婆说你再也不会回来了
Grandma says you're never coming back.

156
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,150
是菲利帕吗
Phillipa,is that you?

157
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,450
让外婆听电话好吗
Put Grandma on the phone for me,will you?

158
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,320
她在摇头
She's shaking her head.

159
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,960
那个 外婆说的不对
Well,just hope she's wrong about that.

160
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,030
爸爸
Daddy?

161
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,760
詹姆斯怎么了
Yeah,James?

162
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,600
妈妈跟你在一起吗
Is Mommy with you?

163
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,440
詹姆斯 我跟你说过了
James,we talked about this.

164
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,070
妈妈她已经不在了
Mommy's not here anymore.

165
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,370
她去哪了
Where?

166
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,750
好了 孩子们 说再见吧
That's enough,kids. Say bye-bye.

167
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,950
喂 我会让外公帮我给你们礼物回去  
Listen,I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa,all right?

168
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,450
你们要乖啊...
And you be good,you be...

169
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,860
-直升机来了 屋顶  -好
- Our ride's on the roof. - Right.

170
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,200
你没事吧  
Hey,are you okay?

171
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,240
当然 怎么了
Yeah. Yeah,I'm fine. Why?

172
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,840
在梦里时  茉儿出现了
Well,down in the dream,Mal showing up.

173
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,080
噢 很抱歉 她开枪打了你的腿
Look,I'm,uh,sorry about your leg.

174
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,250
下不为例
Won't happen again.

175
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,860
情况越来越糟了吧
It's getting worse,isn't it?

176
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,020
亚瑟 我除了抱歉 没有其他解释 
One apology's all you're getting,all right,Arthur?

177
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,650
-纳什他人呢  -他还没来 要等他吗
- Where's Nash? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

178
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,290
我们在2小时前就该把
We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...

179
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,220
斋藤的扩建方案送给科博公司
to Cobol Engineering two hours ago

180
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,010
现在他们肯定知道我们失败了
By now,they know we failed.

181
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,630
是时候闪人了
It's time we disappear.

182
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,660
-你要去哪   -布宜诺斯艾利斯
- Where you gonna go? - Buenos Aires.

183
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,050
先避一避风头 
I can lie low there,

184
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,100
等风声平息候再揽个活干 你呢
maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?

185
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,470
回美国
Stateside.

186
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,170
代我向你家里人问好
Send my regards.

187
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,080
他出卖了你们 跑来求我饶他一命
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.

188
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,660
好了 还是你们自己来处理吧
So I offer you the satisfaction.

189
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,530
这不是我的风格
It's not the way I deal with things.

190
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,670
-你要怎么处置他  -不管他
- What will you do with him? - Nothing.

191
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,680
不过科博公司会如何处理 那就难说了
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

192
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,090
-你想让我们干什么  -植入想法
- What do you want from us? - Inception.

193
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,100
-可能吗  -当然不可能
- Is it possible? - Of course not.

194
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,470
既然能从别人脑子里偷走想法
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...

195
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,500
为什么不能反过来植入一个想法
why can't you plant one there instead?

196
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,770
好 我来给你植入一个想法
Okay,here's me planting an idea in your head.

197
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,450
我对你说 "别去想大象" 
I say,"Don't think about elephants".

198
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,240
你会想什么
What are you thinking about?

199
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,440
大象
Elephants.

200
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,310
没错 因为这是我强加给你的想法   
Right. But it's not your idea,

201
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,970
我越是不让你去想什么 你反而越是会去想
Because you know I gave it to you.

202
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,950
人总能发现想法的来源
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.

203
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,320
-真正的动机是无法作假的  -不能那么说
- True inspiration's impossible to fake. - That's not true.

204
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,960
-你能做到吗  -你想帮我们躲避追杀？
- Can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice?

205
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,790
我自己就能把科博公司搞定
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.

206
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,000
看来你不需要我这个选择
Then you do have a choice.

207
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,930
我只想选择离开着
Then I choose to leave,sir.

208
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,540
告诉飞行员你们要去哪儿
Tell the crew where you want to go.

209
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,880
嘿 柯布先生
Hey,Mr. Cobb.

210
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:25,220
让你回家意下如何 回到美国 和孩子们团圆  
How would you like to go home,to America,to your children?

211
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,990
这太难 你做不到 没人能做到
You can't fix that. No one can.

212
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,400
-比植如想法还难吗  -走啦 柯布
- Just like inception. - Cobb,come on.

213
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,030
-你要植入的想法有多复杂  -其实 相当简单
- How complex is the idea? - Simple enough.

214
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,560
任何你要植入别人大脑的想法
No idea is simple when you need to plant it

215
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,740
都不可能简单
in somebody else's mind.

216
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,640
我最大的竞争对手是个病入膏肓的老人
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.

217
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,580
他的儿子马上就要接管他的公司
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.

218
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,050
我想要他毁掉他父亲创建的帝国
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.

219
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,420
-柯布 我们不要趟这摊浑水  -先等一下
- Cobb,we should walk away from this. - Hold on.

220
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,760
如果我愿意干 我是说 如果我确实做到了
If I were to do this,if I even could do it...

221
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,830
你必须给我一个承诺
I'd need a guarantee.

222
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,270
-不然我凭什么相信你会帮我回家  -你别无选择
- How do I know you can deliver? - You don't.

223
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,330
但我可以做到
But I can.

224
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,510
你愿意放手一搏
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

225
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,780
还是要等到年华逝去 在悔恨中度过余生
or become an old man,filled with regret...

226
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,550
孤零零地等死
waiting to die alone?

227
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,270
组建你的团队吧  柯布先生  
Assemble your team,Mr. Cobb.

228
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,920
这次可别再选错人了
And choose your people more wisely.

229
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,860
我知道你有多想回家
Look,I know how much you wanna go home.

230
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,400
但这活我们干不了
This can't be done.

231
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,200
干得了
Yes,it can.

232
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,840
只要潜入得足够深
Just have to go deep enough.

233
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,570
你怎么知道
You don't know that.

234
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,740
我以前做过
I've done it before.

235
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,110
对谁植入的
Who'd you do it to?

236
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,350
为什么去巴黎
Why are we going to Paris?

237
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,660
找个新的筑梦师
We're gonna need a new architect.

238
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,990
你就从来没喜欢过你的办公室 是吧
You never did like your office,did you?

239
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
那地方小得就像个壁橱 根本没法思考
No space to think in that broom cupboard.

240
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,580
你来这里安全吗
Is it safe for you to be here?

241
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,220
你也知道 法国和美国间的引渡条款
Extradition between France and the United States...

242
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,620
乱得像团麻
is a bureaucratic nightmare,you know that.

243
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,820
说不定就你的案子
I think they might find a way

244
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,710
为了抓你 他们会想办法破个例
to make it work in your case.

245
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,950
如果...方便的话
Look,I,uh,brought these for you to...

246
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,380
帮我把礼物带给孩子
give to the kids when you have a chance.

247
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,250
你想让他们感觉还有个父亲
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...

248
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,290
偶尔送些小礼物可不够啊
to convince those children they still have a father.

249
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,180
我只是尽我所能  
I'm just doing what I know.

250
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,290
这些都是你教我的
I'm doing what you taught me.

251
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,990
我可没教你去当小偷
I never taught you to be a thief.

252
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
没 你教我如何操纵别人的思想
No,you taught me to navigate people's minds.

253
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,830
但那次出事以后...
But after what happened...

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,780
我再也没有机会
there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways

255
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,570
合法地施展这个能力了
for me to use that skill.

256
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,210
道姆 你来这想干嘛
What are you doing here,Dom?

257
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,710
我找到了回家的办法
I think I found a way home.

258
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,450
帮一个非常有权势的人干一票
It's a job for some very,very powerful people.

259
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,090
他就能彻底撤销对那些对我莫须有的指控
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.

260
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,150
但我要你帮点忙
But I need your help.

261
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,160
你是来骗走我最好最聪明的学生吗
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

262
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,780
你知道我开的条件优越  
You know what I'm offering.

263
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,230
你得让他们自己决定
Let them decide for themselves.

264
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,860
-钱吗  -不仅仅是钱
- Money. - Not just money.

265
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,360
你应该知道
You remember.

266
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,080
这是一个千载难逢的机会 
It's the chance to

267
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,770
你可以去去建造教堂 去造城市
build cathedrals,entire cities...

268
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,700
去造现实世界从未存在的
things that never existed...

269
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,080
也绝不可能存在的事物
things that couldn't exist in the real world.

270
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,570
你是想找我的一个学生
So you want me to let someone else

271
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,420
跟你一起进入梦幻世界？
follow you into your fantasy?

272
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,550
他们不必亲自进入梦境
They don't actually come into the dream.

273
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,190
他们只需要替盗梦者
They just design the levels

274
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,000
设计梦境的每一个场景就行了
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

275
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,390
你自己设计吧
Design it yourself.

276
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,560
茉儿会阻止我的
Mal won't let me.

277
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,900
回到现实中来吧  道姆
Come back to reality,Dom.

278
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,800
-求你了  -现实
- Please. - Reality.

279
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,710
我的孩子们 也就是你的外孙们...
Those kids,your grandchildren...

280
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,230
正在苦苦等着他们的爸爸回家
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

281
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,980
这个就是他们的现实
That's their reality.

282
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
而只有干完这最后一票
And this job,this last job,

283
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,250
我才能实现这个愿望 才可以回家
that's how I get there.

284
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,420
我要不是走投无路  我绝不会来这求你的
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.

285
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,490
我需要个和我一样出色的筑梦师
I need an architect who's as good as I was.

286
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,690
有个比你更出色的
I've got somebody better.

287
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,900
艾莲涅
Ariadne?

288
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,040
介绍一下 柯布先生
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

289
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,540
幸会
Pleased to meet you.

290
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,870
如果你有空
If you have a few moments,

291
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,170
柯布先生这儿有份工作
Mr. Cobb has a job offer.

292
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,380
不知道你感不感兴趣
He'd like to discuss with you.

293
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,580
是实习吗
A work placement?

294
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,280
不算吧
Not exactly.

295
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,780
先来做个测试吧
I have a test for you.

296
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,580
先跟我说说是什么样的工作
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

297
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,390
我想先看看你能否胜任这个工作
Before I describe the job,I have to know you can do it.

298
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,760
-为什么  -严格来说 这份工作并不合法
- Why? - It's not,strictly speaking,legal.

299
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,860
我给你两分钟 来设计一个
You have two minutes to design a maze

300
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,530
不能在一分钟之内破解的迷宫
that it takes one minute to solve.

301
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,600
停
Stop.

302
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,240
再来
Again.

303
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,710
停
Stop.

304
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,950
还是太简单了
You're gonna have to do better than that.

305
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,230
这才像话
That's more like it.

306
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,320
有人说我们醒着的时候
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.

307
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,180
大脑隐藏了大部分的潜能
Now,that's when we're awake.

308
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,320
而睡着的时候 大脑却几乎无所不能
When we're asleep,our mind can do almost anything.

309
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,520
比如呢
Such as?

310
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,950
比如说 你正在设计一幢楼房
Imagine you're designing a building.

311
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,690
你必须有意识地设计每一个细节
You consciously create each aspect.

312
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,680
但有时候 楼房像在自己设计自己
But sometimes,it feels like it's almost creating itself,

313
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,700
明白吗
if you know what I mean.

314
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,830
明白 好像我只是发现了它
Yeah,like I'm discovering it.

315
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,270
这就叫灵感 对吗
Genuine inspiration,right?

316
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,770
可做梦的时候
Now,in a dream,our mind continuously does this.

317
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,580
我们一边设计 一边发现这个世界 创造和感知同步发生
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.

318
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,200
这一切非常自然  
And our mind does this so well

319
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,150
自然到我们都感觉不到
that we don't even know it's happening.

320
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,050
所以我们可以直接侵入这个过程
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.

321
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,590
-怎么做  -接管大脑的设计工作
- How? - By taking over the creating part.

322
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,390
而这就是你的工作
Now,this is where I need you.

323
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,920
我需要你创造一个 梦境
You create the world of the dream.

324
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,820
然后把目标带进来
We bring the subject into that dream,

325
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,470
接下来 目标的潜意识 会产生梦境里的居民
and they fill it with their subconscious.

326
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,850
我要设计得多细致
How could I ever acquire enough detail

327
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,300
才能让目标相信他们身在现实 没在做梦
to make them think that it's reality?

328
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,940
其实呢 我们做梦的时候都感觉很真实
Well,dreams,they feel real while we're in them,right?

329
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,960
只有等我们醒来的时候
It's only when we wake up

330
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,810
才会意识到有些事情不大对劲
that we realize something was actually strange.

331
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,680
那我问你
Let me ask you a question.

332
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,250
你是不是从不记得梦的开始
You never really remember the beginning of a dream,do you?

333
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,450
而记住的 都是中间的一些过程
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.

334
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,650
好像是的
I guess,yeah.

335
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,390
那我们是怎么来这的
So how did we end up here?

336
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,860
我们刚从...
Well,we just came from the,uh...

337
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,490
仔细想 艾莲涅 你怎么来这的
Think about it,Ariadne. How did you get here?

338
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,000
你现在到底在哪儿
Where are you right now?

339
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,470
在做梦？
We're dreaming?

340
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,070
你其实正睡在工作坊中央
You're in the middle of the workshop,sleeping.

341
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,210
这是你学习分享梦境的第一课 冷静点
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

342
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,680
要是在做梦的话 你干嘛要保护...
If it's just a dream,then why are you covering...

343
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,050
因为这梦永远不只是梦
Because it's never just a dream,is it?

344
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,600
玻璃刺在脸上 会非常疼
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.

345
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,520
做梦的时候 感觉都是真实的
When you're in it,it feels real.

346
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,890
所以军队开发了梦境分享系统
That's why the military developed dream sharing.

347
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,410
士兵可以在里面相互射击
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot,

348
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,760
格斗和搏杀等等
stab and strangle each other...

349
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,060
然后再醒过来 不会真的受伤
and then wake up.

350
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,160
筑梦师的工作是什么
How did architects become involved?

351
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,070
总得有人来设计梦境吧
Well,someone had to design the dreams,right?

352
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,530
干嘛不再给我们五分钟
Why don't you give us another five minutes?

353
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,800
五分钟？
Five minutes?

354
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,510
怎么会 我们少说也聊了一个小时
What? We were talking for,like,at least an hour.

355
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,910
做梦时 大脑的运转速度非常快
In a dream,your mind functions more quickly...

356
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,910
所以感觉时间过得比较慢
therefore time seems to feel more slow.

357
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,450
现实世界的五分钟 相当于梦境里的一小时
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.

358
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,250
试试看你在五分钟内能做设计出什么来
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,100
基本布局你已经有了 书店 咖啡店
You've got the basic layout. Bookstore,cafe?

360
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,930
其他该有的也都有了
Almost everything else is here too.

361
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,130
-那他们是谁  -我潜意识产生的防御者
- Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.

362
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,370
-你的潜意识  -对
- Yours? - Yes.

363
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,070
记住 你是做梦者 你设计梦境
Remember,you are the dreamer. You build this world.

364
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,000
而我是你的目标 这些人是我大脑产生的
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

365
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,000
你可以和目标的潜意识直接对话
You can literally talk to my subconscious.

366
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,140
这也是偷取信息的一种办法
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.

367
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,480
除此之外呢
How else do you do it?

368
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,580
你可以设计一个安全场所
By creating something secure,

369
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,650
比如银行金库 或是监狱
like a bank vault or a jail.

370
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,560
重要信息就会自动存入其中
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.

371
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,700
懂了吗
You understand?

372
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,120
-然后你就会潜入梦境去偷  -这个嘛...
- Then you break in and steal it? - Well...

373
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,190
我一直以为梦是视觉来构建的
I guess I thought that the dream's space should be all about the visual,

374
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,930
但其实其他感觉好像更重要
but it's more about the feel of it.

375
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,220
我想知道 如果我颠覆了
My question is what happens when you

376
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,870
物理规律 会怎样
start messing with the physics of it all?

377
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,830
-很厉害吧  -是啊
- It's something,isn't it? - Yes,it is.

378
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,040
他们为什么都看着我
Why are they all looking at me?

379
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,100
因为我的潜意识怀疑这不是一个真实的世界
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.

380
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,420
你改变的东西越多
The more you change things,

381
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,210
防御者们就会越快地涌向你
the quicker the projections start to converge on you.

382
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,220
涌向我？ 
Converge?

383
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,770
他们能感觉到你是个入侵者
They sensed the foreign nature of the dreamer.

384
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,880
就会像血液里的白细胞会攻击细菌一样
They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.

385
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,080
他们会攻击我们
Are they gonna attack us?

386
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,270
错 只攻击你
No,actually,just you.

387
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,940
这样的设计是很棒   
This is great. But I'm telling you,

388
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,890
但如果你再这么继续下去...
if you keep changing things like this...

389
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,400
受不了 就不能让你的潜意识冷静点么
Gees! Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?

390
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,140
这可是我的潜意识 我自己没法控制
It's my subconscious,remember,I can't control it.

391
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,710
佩服
Very impressive.

392
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,650
这座桥我见过 它是现实中的 对吗
I know this bridge. This place is real,isn't it?

393
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,070
是啊 我每天上学都会经过这
Yeah,I cross it everyday to get to the college.

394
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,040
绝对不能根据记忆重建场景
Never recreate places from your memory,

395
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,510
必须创造新的东西
always imagine new places.

396
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,600
那总会借用熟悉的东西吧
Well,you gotta draft from stuff you know,right?

397
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
只能借用细节...
Only use details,uh...

398
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,980
比如路灯啊电话亭啊  但绝不能复制整块地区
A street lamp,or a phone booth,never entire areas.

399
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,810
为什么 
Why not?

400
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,230
当你凭记忆构建梦境的时候
Because building a dream from your memory...

401
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,850
极易让你迷失 何为梦境何为现实
is the easiest way to lose your grasp on  what's real and what is a dream.

402
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,850
-看来你搞混过  -喂
- Is that what happened to you? - Listen to me,

403
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,120
这和我无关 懂吗
this has nothing to do with me,understand?

404
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,560
所以你才需要我来帮你筑梦
Is that why you need me to build your dreams?

405
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,670
别碰她 走开
Get off of her. Back off.

406
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,610
-滚开  -别碰我
- Back off! - No!

407
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,000
别碰她
Get off of her!

408
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,260
茉儿
Mal!

409
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,490
把我叫醒  快把我叫醒 
Wake me up! Wake me up!

410
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,870
茉儿 茉儿
Mal! Mal!

411
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,000
叫醒我
Wake me up! Wake me up!

412
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,620
看着我 你没事了 没事了
Hey,hey,hey! Look at me. You're okey? You're okey?

413
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,700
为什么我醒不过来
Why... why wouldn't I wake up?

414
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,470
因为时间没到 所以你醒不了
Because there was still some time on the clock,

415
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,720
除非你在死在梦里 不然没法提前醒来
and you can't wake up within a dream unless you die.

416
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,750
-她需要个图腾  -什么
- She'll need a totem. - What?

417
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,620
图腾是个小的私人物品...
A totem is a small personal...

418
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,190
你的防御者可真厉害啊  柯布
That's some subconscious you've got in you,Cobb.

419
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,710
还是个大美人呢 
She's a real charmer!

420
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,660
看来你见过柯布夫人了
Oh,I see you met Mrs. Cobb.

421
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,730
-那是他妻子？  -对 话说图腾...
- She's his wife? - Yeah. So... a totem,

422
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,790
就是一个有分量的小物件
you need a small object potentially heavy,

423
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,790
你可以一直带在身边
something could have on you all the time

424
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,450
-但不能让别人知道  -硬币行吗
- that no one else knows. - Like a coin?

425
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,980
不行 必须更独特些才行
No,it must be more unique than that.

426
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,250
比如这个注铅的骰子
This is a loaded die.

427
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,570
你不能碰 碰了就没用了
No,I can't let you touch it,that would defeat the purpose.

428
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,130
只有我知道这个特制骰子的重心在哪里
Only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.

429
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,850
只有这样 当你看到自己的图腾
That way,when you look at your totem,

430
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,270
你才能确信自己不在别人的梦里
you know,beyond a doubt,that you're not in someone else's dream.

431
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,400
我 我问你啊...
I... I don't know...

432
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,180
你是看不出来 还是不想看出来发生了什么
if you can't see what's going on,or if you just don't want to,

433
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,780
柯布的心里问题很严重 而且他还想把那些问题藏起来
but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.

434
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,720
我绝对不会允许这样的人进入我的梦境
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.

435
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,960
她会回来的
She'll be back.

436
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,750
我还从没见过有人学得这么快
I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.

437
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,450
现实已经满足不了她了
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.

438
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,300
等她回来...
When she comes back...

439
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,510
你可以开始教她设计迷宫了
when she comes back,you're gonna help her building mazes.

440
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,840
-那你呢  -我要去找伊姆斯
- Where're you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames.

441
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,020
伊姆斯 他不是在蒙巴萨吗[肯尼亚港口城市]
Eames? Now he's in Mombasa.

442
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
那里可是科博公司的老巢
It's Cobol's backyard.

443
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
必须冒这个险 
It's a necessary risk.

444
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,570
神偷多了去了
There's plenty of good thieves.

445
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:04,130
可好的伪装者不多 他最合适
We don't just need a thief. We need a forger.

446
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,630
你再怎么搓它们也下不出崽儿来
You can rub them together all you want,they're not gonna breed.

447
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,180
这不好说啊
You never know.

448
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,580
过来喝一杯
I'll get you a drink.

449
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,950
好 你请
You're buying.

450
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,780
-你的拼写没什么长进啊  -给我滚
- Your spelling hasn't improved. - Piss off.

451
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,160
-会模仿笔迹吗  -必须 我这么多才多艺
- How's your handwriting? - Versatile.

452
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,400
-那就好  -谢了
- Good. - Thank you very much.

453
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,590
植入想法
Inception.

454
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,610
你先别和我说这办不到 不可能...
Now,before you bother telling me it's impossible...

455
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,770
非常可能 就是难得要死
No,it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.

456
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,170
只是难吗
Just difficult?

457
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,800
亚瑟总说这是不可能的
Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

458
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,780
哈 亚瑟 还和那个木头脑袋在一起
Hmm... Arthur. You're still working with that stick-in-the-mud?

459
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,870
他有他的特长
He's good at what he does,right?

460
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,110
是不错 只是缺乏想象力
Oh,the best. He has no imagination.

461
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,530
-不像你  -真的 如果你要植入一个想法的话
- Not like you. - Listen,if you wanna perform inception,

462
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,150
-就必须要有想象力  -那好我问你
- you need imagination. - Let me ask you something,

463
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,040
-你以前做过吗  -我们试过
- have you done it before? - We tried it.

464
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,730
把想法放进去了 但没有巩固住
We got the idea in place,but it didn't take.

465
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,500
因为植入得不够深
You didn't plant it deep enough?

466
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,410
这不仅仅是深度的问题
It's not just about depth,you know...

467
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,270
要把想法简化到最简形式再植入
you need the simplest version of the idea,

468
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,890
这样才能在主体大脑中自然成长
in order it to grow naturally in the subject's mind.

469
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,370
这是相当精妙的技艺
That's a very subtle art.

470
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,140
来 说下你要植入的想法是什么
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

471
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,610
我们要让一个大公司的继承人
We need the heir of a major corporation

472
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,490
瓦解他父亲的能源帝国
to dissolve his father's empire.

473
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,010
你看 你可以从各种政治动机的角度来考虑...
Well,you see right there,you have various political motivations of...

474
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,440
比如 反垄断的情绪等诸如此类的
anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth,and all of that stuff.

475
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,130
能不能植入
That's all.

476
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,190
关键得看目标人物的那个心结有多大 懂吗
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice,you see?

477
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,950
你必须从一个最根本的问题入手
All you have to do is to start with the absolute basic.

478
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,360
-你指的是  -他和父亲之间的关系
- Which is what? - The relationship with the father.

479
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,830
-找到药剂师了吗  -还没有
- Do you have a chemist? - No,not yet.

480
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,580
那好
Alright.

481
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,240
我这倒有个人选 叫尤瑟夫 Pierro
Okey,there's a man here,Yusuf Pierro.

482
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,050
他的催眠剂配方独一无二
He formulates his own versions of the compounds.

483
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,870
什么时候带我去见见
When are you taking me there?

484
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,420
你先甩掉跟踪你的人吧
Once you've lost your tail.

485
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,730
吧台边儿上那个
Man at the bar.

486
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,120
科博 公司开的赏金
Cobol engineering.

487
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,730
是要活捉我还是要杀了我
That price on my head,was that "dead or alive?"

488
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,920
不记得了 看他开不开枪
I don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.

489
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,250
替我引开他 然后过半个小时
Run interference,I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in,say uh...

490
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,110
楼下门口碰头
say half an hour?

491
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,800
-还回来  -最危险的地方最安全
- Be back here? - It's the last place they'd expect.

492
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,680
哈 好
Hum-hmm. Well...

493
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,820
弗雷迪  弗雷迪·赛文斯
Freddy,Freddy Savens?

494
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,370
天啊 还真是你啊
My God,it's you,isn't it?

495
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,450
看来我认错人了
No,it isn't.

496
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,920
这下你不是在做梦了吧
You're not dreaming now,are you?

497
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,010
那边
There!

498
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,080
没事
Okey.

499
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,750
咖啡 要一杯咖啡
Oh,uh... cafe. One... one cafe.

500
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,980
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

501
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,700
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

502
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,590
要搭车么 伙计
Care for a lift,Mr. Cobb?

503
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,330
你来蒙巴萨干嘛
What're you doing here in Mombasa?

504
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,540
来保护我的投资对象
I need to protect my investments.

505
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,930
你就是这么甩掉冤家的啊
Ahh,so this is your idea of losing a tail,uh?

506
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,390
另一个冤家这是
Different tail.

507
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,410
柯布说了你会回来
Cobb said you'd be back.

508
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,440
我也不想 可我...
I tried not to come. But...

509
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,160
已经无法自拔了
But there's nothing quite like it.

510
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,740
我只喜欢...纯粹的创造
It's just... pure creation.

511
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,870
我们先来学一下不可能建筑吧
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?

512
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,560
想要构建完整的三层梦境 
You're gonna have to master a few tricks,

513
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,730
有些窍门你必须要掌握
if you're gonna build three complete dream levels.

514
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,440
不好意思 让一下
Excuse me.

515
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,060
什么窍门
What kind of tricks?

516
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,650
在梦里 你可以把建筑设计成不可能的图形
In a dream,you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.

517
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,840
这样你就能造出闭合的路线
That lets you create closed loops,

518
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,180
比如著名的 没有尽头的 彭罗斯阶梯  
like the Penrose steps,the infinite staircases.

519
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,100
看见没
See?

520
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,980
矛盾建筑
Paradox.

521
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,060
这样的闭合路线
So a closed loop like that will help you

522
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,460
可以帮你隐藏梦境的边界
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

523
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,020
我需要设计多大的场景
But how big do these levels have to be?

524
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,370
随你 可以是一层楼 也可以是整座城市
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.

525
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,790
但梦境场景结构必须够复杂
But they have to be complicated

526
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,870
好让我们有藏身之处 躲避防御者的追踪
enough that we can hide from the projections.

527
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,890
比如一个迷宫
A maze?

528
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,900
对 迷宫 迷宫越复杂...
Right,a maze,and the better the maze...

529
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,740
防御者就越难找到我们
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?

530
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,700
-没错  -看来我潜意识里的防御者就很有礼貌
- Exactly. - My subconscious seems polite enough.

531
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,360
等着瞧 他们会翻脸不认人的
You wait,they'll turn ugly.

532
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,300
没人喜欢别人在自己的大脑里乱来的
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.

533
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,800
柯布已经不能再筑梦了吗
Cobb can't build anymore,can he?

534
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,740
就算他可以 他也不愿意
I don't know if he can't,but he won't.

535
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,470
他说他不熟悉设计会更安全
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.

536
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,470
为什么  
Why?

537
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,260
他不愿意说  我想是因为茉儿吧
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.

538
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,790
-他的前妻？  -不 不是前妻
- His ex-wife? - No,not his ex.

539
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,530
-他们还在一起  -没有  她...
- They're still together? - No,she...

540
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,640
她已经去世了
she's dead.

541
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,830
你看到的只是他潜意识里的茉儿
What you just see in there is just his projection of her.

542
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,230
-她在现实中什么样  -很迷人
- What was she like in real life? - She was lovely.

543
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,290
-你要找药剂师  -对
- You're seeking a chemist? - Yes.

544
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,290
是要调配催眠剂吗
To formulate compounds for a job.

545
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,310
还要和我们一起进入梦境 工作 
And to go into the field with us.

546
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,080
我很少进入梦境  柯布先生 
No,I rarely go into the field,Mr. Cobb.

547
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,050
你得一直跟着我们 根据需要 在梦里调配药剂
We need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.

548
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,120
-有什么要求  -足够深度
- Which are? - Great depth.

549
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,670
梦中梦吗 两层梦境
A dream within a dream? two levels?

550
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,690
-三层  -这不可能
- Three. - Not possible.

551
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,000
这种多层梦境太不稳定了
That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.

552
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,190
有可能 只需要在配方里增加加镇静剂
It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.

553
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,650
超级无敌强效镇静剂
A powerful sedative.

554
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,930
-一共几个人  -五个
- How many team members? - Five.

555
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,520
六个
Six.

556
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,350
为了确定你是否完成任务
The only way to know you've done the job

557
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,930
我得跟你一起进去
is if I go in with you.

558
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,150
这种工作带游客 可不行啊
There's no room for tourists on a job like this,

559
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,170
斋藤先生
Mr. Saito.

560
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,040
那这次得破例了
This time it seems there is.

561
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,600
我们可以用这个作为基础 我每天都用
This,I think,is a good place to start. I use it everyday.

562
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,580
-用来做什么  -来 我带你看看
- What for? - Here,I'll show you.

563
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,620
-做好心理准备  -你先请
- Perhaps,you will not want to see. - After you.

564
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,050
十个...十二个 全部连在一起  
Ten... twelve,all connected.

565
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,690
我 的 妈 呀
Bloody hell!

566
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,300
他们每天来这分享梦境
They come here everyday to share the dream.

567
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,160
看见没 非常稳定
You see? Very stable.

568
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,670
-他们每天做梦多久  -三四个小时吧
- How long do they dream for? - Three,four hours,each day.

569
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,410
-梦里是多久  -在这种药效下
- And the dream time? - With this compound?

570
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,010
每人每天四十个小时
About 40 hours,each and every day.

571
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,630
他们为什么这么做
Why do they do it?

572
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,370
你来说吧 柯布先生
Tell him,Mr. Cobb.

573
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,000
在你用药一阵子后
After a while,

574
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,610
不用药就没法做梦了
it becomes the only way you can dream.

575
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,990
你还做梦吗 柯布先生  
Do you still dream,Mr. Cobb?

576
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,890
他们每天来这做梦吗
They come here everyday to sleep?

577
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,890
不 他们来这是为了醒过来
No,they come to be woken up.

578
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,650
梦境已成了他们的现实世界 谁说现实不是梦境呢
The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise,uh?

579
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,850
让我见识一下吧
Let's see what you can do.

580
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,000
你知道怎么找到我 你知道你该怎么做
You know how to find me. You know what you have to do.

581
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,670
很清晰吧
Sharp? No?

582
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,040
你没事吧 柯布先生  
Are you all right,Mr. Cobb?

583
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,640
放心 我没事
Yeah,yeah. I'm just fine.

584
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,670
罗伯特·费舍尔
Robert Fischer,

585
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,050
费舍尔明日能源集团的继承人
heir to the Fischer-Morrow Energy Conglomerate.

586
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,220
你和这位费舍尔先生有什么过节
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

587
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,860
这不用你管
That's not your concern.

588
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,820
斋藤先生 这...
Mr. Saito,this...

589
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,540
这可不是一般意义上的商业间谍活动
this isn't your typical corporate espionage.

590
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,780
你让我植入一个想法 我希望你能理解...
You asked me for inception,I do hope you understand that...

591
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,810
这其中的严重性
the gravity of that request.

592
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,910
我们植入目标大脑的这个想法
The seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

593
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,250
会界定他会成为一个怎样的人
This idea would define him. It may come to change...

594
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,680
甚至可能会彻底改变他的人生
it may come to change everything about him.

595
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,940
要不是我们公司 他们早就垄断全球的能源市场了
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.

596
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,240
但我们快撑不住了
We can no longer compete.

597
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,730
很快他们将控制半个世界的能源供给
Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world.

598
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,060
然后他们将成为新兴的强权帝国
In effect,they become a new superpower.

599
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,640
但只要罗伯特·费舍尔改变想法
The world needs Robert Fischer

600
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,350
世界就能得救
to change his mind.

601
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,000
所以你找上我们了
That's where we come in.

602
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,460
这个罗伯特·费舍尔
How is Robert Fischer's

603
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:23,980
和他父亲的关系如何
relationship with his father?

604
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,270
有传言说他们之间的关系有些纠结
Rumor is their relationship is quite complicated.

605
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,040
要完成任务 光靠传言可不够
But we can't work based solely on rumor,can we?

606
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,480
能帮我接近这个人吗
Can you get me access to this man here,

607
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,390
布朗宁
Browning?

608
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,740
老费舍尔的左膀右臂
Fischer senior's right-hand man,

609
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,450
费舍尔的教父
Fischer junior's godfather.

610
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,890
应该不难 只要你有适当的引荐信
It should be possible,if you can get the right references.

611
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,730
不成问题 我的专长就是 各种伪造 
References are something of a speciality for me,Mr. Saito.

612
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,520
看来这案子和解不了
I'm not smelling settlement here.

613
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,230
-把他们告倒  -布朗宁先生
- Take them down. - Mr. Browning,

614
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,380
老费舍尔先生的原则之一
Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of

615
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,590
就是避免一切诉讼
avoiding litigation.

616
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,580
那我们要不要进去和老Fischer先生
Well,shall we voice your concerns

617
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,660
来个面对面交谈
with Maurice directly?

618
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,560
那也不用
Not sure if that's necessary.

619
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,610
不不 我可以去问问他
No,no,no. I think we should.

620
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,780
他怎么样了
How is he?

621
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,150
我也不想打扰他 但...
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily,but...

622
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,920
罗伯特 我不是跟你说过
Robert,I've told you to

623
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,620
别让他们进来
keep out the damn...

624
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,020
照做有那么难吗
so do it!

625
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,340
老费舍尔先生 你现在不适合讲话 
No,don't speak,Mr. Fischer.

626
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,950
你啊 从来都没听过话
Never... never do as same as I asked.

627
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,380
别管那个了
Leave that.Here.

628
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,810
这肯定是他很珍贵的回忆
Must be a cherished memory of his.

629
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,670
我把相框放在他床边  他连看都没看一眼
I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed it.

630
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:09,980
罗伯特 我们恐怕得谈谈你的继承权了
Robert,we need to talk about the power of attorney.

631
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
-我知道你很难过...  -现在不行 彼得叔叔
- I know this is hard for you...  - Not now,uncle Peter.

632
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,220
但刻不容缓 我们必须得开始准备了...
But it's imperative that we start to...

633
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,630
秃鹰已经在盘旋了
The vultures are circling.

634
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,780
老费舍尔病得越重
It is the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,

635
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,090
布朗宁就变得越有权力
The more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

636
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,180
我花了不少时间 来观察了布朗宁
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning,

637
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,400
熟悉他的外貌身形 研究他的言谈举止和习惯等等
adopt his physical presence,study his mannerisms,so on and so forth.

638
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,690
所以 在梦境的第一层  
So now,in the first layer of the dream,

639
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,460
我可以扮成布朗宁
I can impersonate Browning,

640
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,930
把想法暗示到Fischer的潜意识中
and suggest the concept to Fischer's conscious mind.

641
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,980
当我们带他进入第二层
Then,when we take him a level deeper,

642
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,140
他潜意识中所投影出来的布朗宁
his own projection of Browning should...

643
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,170
就会把这些想法反馈给他自己
should feed that right back to him.

644
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,250
-于是他以为那是他自己的想法  -没错
- So he gives himself the idea? - Precisely.

645
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,470
想要植入生根 必须让想法看起来是自己产生的 
That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.

646
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,420
伊姆斯 我很佩服
Eames,I am impressed.

647
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,000
能得到你的表扬
Your condescension,as always,

648
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,860
我真是三生有幸 谢谢亚瑟
is much appreciated,Arthur. Thank you.

649
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,030
你刚刚是一个人进入梦境吗
Were you going under on your own?

650
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,820
没什么 我就是做些实验
No,no. I was just,uh...  just running some experiments.

651
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,920
没想到这里还有别人 所以...
I didn't realize anyone was here. So...

652
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,610
嗯  其实我是在准备我的图腾
Yeah,I was just... I was working on my totem,actually.

653
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,450
过来 给我看看
Here,let me take a look.

654
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,450
学得不错
So you're learning,huh?

655
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,030
这样鉴别现实和梦境 好优雅啊
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.

656
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,360
-是你想出来的  -不是  其实…….
- Was it your idea? - No,it was,uh...

657
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,870
其实是茉儿想到的 这个...
It was Mal's,actually. This is...

658
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,400
以前是她的图腾
This one was hers.

659
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,200
在梦中旋转这个陀螺 它永远不会倒
She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple,

660
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,880
会这么一直转下去
just spin and spin.

661
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,720
亚瑟跟我说她过世了
Arthur told me she passed away.

662
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,180
迷宫设计得怎么样了
How are the mazes coming along?

663
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,790
根据我们要进入的 潜意识的不同部分 
Each level relates to the part of the subject's

664
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,460
我设计了不同层次与之对应的梦境
subconscious that we're trying to access,so...

665
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,640
所以在最后一层设计成了医院 
Making the bottom level hospital,

666
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,410
这样费舍就能见到他父亲...
so Fischer will bring his father,um...

667
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,010
可关于整个结构 我有个疑问
You know,actually I have a question about this layout...

668
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,390
别别别 千万不要告诉我细节
No,no,no. Don't... don't show me the specifics.

669
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,640
细节应该只有筑梦师知道
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

670
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,090
为什么要这样
Why's that so important?

671
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,640
以防我们中有人把自己的防御者也带进去
In case one of us brings in our projections,

672
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,900
不能让他们知道迷宫的细节
we don't want them knowing the details of the maze.

673
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,390
你是说如果茉儿进来了
You mean in case you bring Mal in?

674
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,760
你也拦不住她 对吧
You can't keep her out,can you?

675
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,470
-是 -你之所以不能筑梦
- Right. - You can't build them because...

676
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,340
是因为你知道迷宫布局了 她也就知道了
if you know the maze,then she knows it.

677
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,100
她就会破坏整个行动
She'd sabotage the whole operation.

678
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,680
柯布 其他人知道吗  
Cobb,did the others know?

679
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,460
不 不知道
No,they don't.

680
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,690
万一情况变糟了 你应该告诉大家
You gotta warn them if this is getting worse.

681
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,290
谁说情况会变糟的
No one said it's getting worse!

682
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,290
我只想要回家
I need to get home.

683
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,820
这是我现在唯一关心的事情
That's all I care about right now.

684
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,110
你为什么不回不了家
Why can't you go home?

685
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,000
警察认为是我杀了她
Because they think I killed her.

686
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,430
-谢谢  -谢什么
- Thank you. - For what?

687
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,520
没有问我 是不是真的杀了她
For not asking whether I did.

688
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,130
"我要瓦解我父亲的帝国"
"I will split up my father's empire."

689
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,080
显然这个想法
Now this is obviously

690
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,650
会被罗伯特自己立刻否定掉
an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject.

691
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,990
所以我们得把这个想法
Just why we need to plant it

692
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,310
植入他潜意识深处
deep in his subconscious.

693
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,270
潜意识是被情感驱动的 对吗  不是理性
Subconscious is motivated by emotion,right? Not reason.

694
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,840
所以必须把情感元素融入到这个想法里
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.

695
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,640
怎么把一个商业策略转变成情感元素
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?

696
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,200
这不等着我们想办法么
That's what we have to figure out,right?

697
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,040
现在罗伯特与他父亲的关系
Now,Robert's relationship with his father is stressed,

698
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,120
至少已经很紧张了
to say the least.

699
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,110
能利用这点吗
Can we run with that,

700
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,820
让他觉得瓦解自己父亲的公司
we could suggest to him breaking up his

701
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,010
就是对老头子的一次反抗
father's company as a "screw you" to the old man?

702
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:37,670
这不行
No,

703
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,820
因为积极情感会压制消极情感
'cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.

704
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,570
我们每个人都渴望和谐、精神上的宣泄
We all yearn for reconciliation,a catharsis.

705
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,870
我们必须让罗伯特·费舍尔
We need Robert Fischer

706
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,510
从正面产生这个想法
to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.

707
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,790
好吧 那这个怎么样
Alright,well,try this,um...

708
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,950
"我父亲希望我靠自己闯出一片天"
"my father accepts that I want to create for myself,

709
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,840
"而不是活在他的温室里"
not follow in his footsteps."

710
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,820
-有点意思 还行  -还行
- That might work. - Might?

711
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,560
只是还行怎么能行
We need to do a little better than "might".

712
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,550
"谢谢你的贡献" 亚瑟 
Oh,thank you for your contribution,Arthur.

713
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,930
我只是想要个明确的思路
Forgive me for wanting a little specificities. Specificity?

714
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,340
要植入想法 可不能指望明确 进入他的大脑以后
Inception is not about being specific. When we get inside his mind,

715
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,430
我们只能见机行事
we're gonna have to work with what we find.

716
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,430
在第一层梦境  我们从他和父亲的紧张关系入手
On the top level,we open up his relationship with his father,

717
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,710
让他知道 "我不想再活在父亲的温室里"
say,"I will not follow in my father's footsteps."

718
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,120
然后到了第二层 让他意识到
Then the next level down,we feed him,

719
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,720
"我要靠自己闯出一片天"
"I will create something for myself."

720
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,980
最后在第三层 我们就亮出王牌
Then,by the time we hit the bottom level,we bring out the big guns...

721
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,020
-"父亲不想让我变成他"  -没错
- "my father doesn't want me to be him. - Exactly.

722
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,240
三层梦境很不稳定 稍有干扰
With three layers down,the dreams are gonna collapse...

723
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,750
梦境就会崩溃
with the slightest disturbance.

724
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,170
镇静剂 为了让你们
Sedation,for a sleep...

725
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,920
稳定地进入第三层梦境
stable enough to create three layers of dreaming.

726
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,200
得在催眠剂配方里加入强力镇静剂
We have to combine with an extremely powerful sedative.

727
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,650
好好睡
Good night.

728
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,300
我们梦境分享时 使用的催眠剂
The compound we'll be using to share the dream

729
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,680
会让做梦者之间产生非常清晰的联系
creates very clear connection between dreamers,

730
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,830
同时也会加快大脑运转速度
whilst actually accelerating brain function.

731
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,400
换句话说 每层梦境的时间都会变长
In other words,it gives us more time on each level.

732
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,340
大脑的运转速度会整整提高二十倍
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.

733
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,900
进入梦中梦 效果会叠加
When you enter a dream within that dream,the effect is compounded.

734
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,240
三层梦境 也就是十小时乘以二十...
Three dreams,that's ten hour times twenty...

735
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,560
不好意思
I'm sorry,uh...

736
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,910
我数学一向不好
math's never my strong subject.

737
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:22,170
-究竟是多长时间  -第一层是一周
- How much time is that? - It's a week the first level down.

738
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,930
第二层是半年 而第三层则是...
Six months the second level down. And the third level...

739
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,350
十年
Ten years.

740
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,350
谁愿意困在梦里长达十年
Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?

741
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,660
看是什么梦咯
Depends on the dream.

742
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,730
那我们成功植入以后 我们要怎么出来
So once we've made the plant,how do we get out?

743
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,060
指望你这回能优雅些
I'm hoping you have something more

744
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,840
我可不想你再冲我脑门开一枪
elegant in mind than shooting me in the head?

745
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,660
-坠落 -什么是坠落
- A kick.- What's a kick?

746
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,710
艾莲涅 这就叫坠落
This,Ariadne,would be a kick.

747
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:50,010
通过一种强烈的撞击或下坠感 将你惊醒
It's that feeling of falling,you get the jolts to wake.

748
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,800
这样就能脱离梦境
It snaps you out of the dream.

749
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,680
用那么多镇静剂 能坠落吗
Are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of sedation?

750
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,920
妙就妙在这儿
Oh,that's the clever part.

751
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,030
我的镇静剂
I customize the sedative

752
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,360
绝对不会影响内耳的平衡功能
to leave inner ear function unimpaired.

753
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:05,050
这样 无论你睡得有多沉 都能感到坠落
That way,however deep the sleep,the sleeper still feels falling,

754
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,370
或倾倒
or tipping.

755
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,170
但关键的是 要让三层梦境的坠落 同步发生
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.

756
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,240
可以用音乐倒计时
We can use a musical countdown

757
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,280
来同步所有的坠落
to synchronize different kicks.

758
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,690
他没预约外科手术、牙医 什么都没有
He hasn't any surgery schedule,no dental,nothing.

759
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,510
他不是该动个膝盖手术吗
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?

760
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,820
没有 没有任何被麻醉的可能 
Nothing. Nothing they'd put him under for,anyway. We need...

761
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,800
我们至少需要十小时
We need at least a good ten hours.

762
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,990
悉尼到洛杉矶
Sydney to Los Angeles,

763
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,940
世界上最长的航线之一
One of the longest flights in the world.

764
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,920
他每两周要往返一次
He makes it every two weeks.

765
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,570
他肯定有私人飞机
And he must be flying private.

766
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,160
要是私人飞机突然出故障了
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.

767
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,450
-最好是波音747  -为什么
- It'd have to be a 747.- Why is that?

768
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,950
747的驾驶舱在顶上
Cause on a 747,pilots are up top,

769
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,010
头等舱在机头上
And the first class cabin's in the nose,

770
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,460
所以不会有闲人打扰
So no one would walk through.

771
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,320
但你得包下头等舱
But you'd have to buyout the entire cabin,

772
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,090
买通所有空乘
And the first class flight attendant.

773
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,640
我把那家航空公司买下来了
I bought the airline.

774
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,170
这样比较省事
It seemed neater.

775
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,270
看来我们有十个小时了
It looks like we have our ten hours.

776
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,930
艾莲涅 那个 干得漂亮
Ariadne? Terrific work,by the way.

777
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,580
你知道怎么找到我
You know how to find me.

778
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,170
你知道你该怎么做
You know what you have to do.

779
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,920
还记得你向我求婚时说的话吗
You remember when you asked me to marry you?

780
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:18,150
-当然记得  -你说你做了一个梦
- Of course I do.- You said you had a dream.

781
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:27,010
-梦到我们一起慢慢变老  -我们会的
- That we grow old together.- And we can.

782
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,350
你来这干嘛 
You shouldn't be in here.

783
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,170
我只是想看看
I just want to see what kind of

784
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,150
你每晚都在独自做什么"实验"
"tests" you're doing on your own every night.

785
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,020
这和你一点关系都没有
Whatever it was,it has nothing to do with you.

786
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,380
怎么会没关系
It has everything to do with me.

787
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,580
-你让我和你分享梦境  -不是分享这个
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.- Not these.

788
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,280
这是我自己的梦
These are my dreams.

789
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,480
你为什么要这么做
Why do you do this to yourself?

790
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,610
只有这样我才能继续做梦
This is the only way I can still dream.

791
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,970
为什么一定得做梦
Why is it so important to dream?

792
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,960
梦里 我跟她在一起
In my dreams we're still together.

793
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,800
这不仅仅是梦 这是你的记忆
These aren't just dreams. These are memories.

794
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,290
-你说过不能用记忆造梦  -我确实说过
- And you said never to use memories.- I know I did.

795
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,970
你想尽办法让她活着 你放不下她
You're trying to keep her alive.you can't let her go.

796
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,060
你不懂
You don't understand.

797
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,510
这些都是让我追悔不已的瞬间
These are moments I regret,

798
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,570
是我想改变的记忆
the memories that I have to change.

799
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,830
那这下面 有什么让你后悔的事
Well,what's down there that you regret?

800
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,060
听好 你不需要了解我所有的想法
Listen,there's only one thing you need to understand about me.

801
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:09,220
-这是你家  -我和茉儿的家
- This is your house? - Mine and Mal's,yes.

802
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,450
-她人呢  -她已经不在了
- Where is she?  - She's already gone.

803
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,780
那是我儿子詹姆斯
It's my son,James.

804
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,440
他最爱挖土 好像在挖虫子
He's digging for something,maybe a worm.

805
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,460
那是菲利帕
That's Philippa.

806
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,850
知道吗 如果当时我叫他们一声
You see,I thought about calling out to them,

807
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,490
他们就能转过头来对我着我笑...
so they'd turn and smile and I can see those...

808
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:37,180
我就能看见他俩可爱的小脸 但...太晚了
Those beautiful faces of theirs.but... It's all too late.

809
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,100
再不走就来不及了 柯布
Right now,or never,Cobb.

810
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,690
我当时就不知所措了 
Then I start to panic.

811
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,700
我知道我将来肯定会后悔
I realize I don't wanna regret this moment,that I..

812
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,280
如果我不最后再看他们一眼的话
I need to see their faces one last time.

813
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,310
詹姆斯  菲利帕  快过来
James! Philippa! Come on in!

814
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,970
但我错过了机会
But the moment's passed.

815
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,160
后来不管我做什么都无法改变那一刻
Whatever I do I can't change this moment.

816
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:09,470
就在我想喊他们时 他们跑开了
When I'm about to call out to them,they run away.

817
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:15,100
我要想再见到他们 就一定得回家
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,I've gotta get back home,

818
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,550
现实中的家
In the real world.

819
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,690
-你来这干嘛  -我叫...
- What are you doing here?  - My name is...

820
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,420
我知道你是谁 我问你来这干嘛
I know who you are.  What are you doing here?

821
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,180
-我只是想试着了解  -你怎么可能了解
- I'm just trying to understand.- How could you understand?

822
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,250
你知道什么叫相爱吗
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

823
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,790
-成为彼此另一半的感觉  -不知道
- To be half of a whole?  - No.

824
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,380
来猜个谜语吧
I'll tell you a riddle.

825
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:40,260
你在等一趟火车 它会把你带去远方
You're waiting for a train,a train that will take you far away.

826
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,130
你了然心之所向
You know where you hope this train will take you,

827
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:47,700
却不知火车开向何方
But you don't know for sure.

828
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,960
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

829
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,930
为什么火车开向哪里不重要呢
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?

830
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,770
因为我们会在一起
Because you'll be together.

831
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,850
道姆 你怎么能把她带过来
How could you bring her here,Dom?

832
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,070
这是什么地方
What is this place?

833
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,440
这是我们庆祝结婚纪念日的套房
This is a hotel suite where we spent our anniversary.

834
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,650
这里发生过什么
What happened here?

835
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,540
你向我承诺过 我们会在一起
You promised! you promised we'd be together!

836
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,370
求你了 留在这 暂时先留在这
Please,I need you stay here,just for now.

837
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:16,080
你说过我们会在一起 我们会一起慢慢变老
You said we'd be together! you said we'd grow old together!

838
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,640
我会回来找你 我保证
I'll come back for you,I promise.

839
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,990
你觉得建一座记忆监狱 就能关住她
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?

840
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,860
你觉得那里能关得住她吗
Do you really think that's gonna contain her?

841
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,660
是时候了 老费舍尔刚在悉尼去世
It's time.Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

842
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,510
-葬礼什么时候  -星期四 在洛杉矶

Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday.

844
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,570
出发吧
We should move.

845
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,260
-好  - 柯布 我跟你一起去
- Right. - Cobb,I'm coming with you.

846
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,920
我答应过我父亲不能让你去冒险 
I promised Miles. No.

847
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,950
得有人了解你潜意识里的挣扎
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.

848
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,620
不带上我也可以
And it doesn't have to be me,

849
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,710
但你得把我刚才看见的都告诉亚瑟
but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.

850
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,720
在飞机上加个位子
Get us another seat on the plane.

851
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,270
如果我上了这飞机 你却不履行我们的协议
If I get on this plane,and you don't honor our agreement,

852
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:31,770
那着陆后 我就会在监狱里度过余生
When we land,I go to jail for the rest of my life.

853
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:37,330
在飞机上把活干完 到时我只要在飞机上打个电话
Complete the job en route,I make one phone call from the plane,

854
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,690
你就能顺利入境
You'll have no trouble getting through immigration.

855
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,760
-抱歉 借过  -啊 不好意思 挡住你了

那个...谢谢
Umm... thank you.

861
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,150
那个 刚刚不小心看到的 
You know,I couldn't help but notice,but...

862
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,250
你不会是那个著名的Maurice Fischer的亲戚吧
You wouldn't happen to be related to "the Maurice Fischer",will you?

863
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:55,600
对 没错 他...是我父亲
Yes,he,um... he was my father.

864
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,060
他是个很了不起的人 节哀顺变
He was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss.

865
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,840

- Couldn't you have peed before you went under. - Sorry.

868
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,980
一看到免费香槟 他就拼命喝 
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff,Yusuf?

869
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,130
你就可劲儿笑吧
Aha,bloody ha.

870
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,170
雨这么大 他肯定在找出租车
Well now,he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.

871
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,590
-蠢货 你怎么不...闪开
- Asshole! Hey man,why don't you try... - Walk away.

872
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,050
我得挂了 出租车 谢谢
I gotta go. Taxi! Thank you.

Alright Third and Market  - Snappy!

874
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,730
-你干嘛  -哎呀 我以为空车
- What're you doing?  - I'm sorry. I thought it was free.

875
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,130
-当然不是  -那咱拼个车吧
- No,it's not. - Maybe we could share.

876
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,820
不行 靠边停让他...
Maybe not. Can you pull over to get this...

877
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,420
"太好了"
Great.

878
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,460
上来
Come on.

879
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,040
这里有五百美元
There's five hundred dollars in there,

880
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,620
而这钱包 还不止这个价
And the wallet's worth more than that.

881
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,930
-好歹送我到目的地吧  -这恐怕...
- So you might at least drop me at my stop.  - I'm afraid...

882
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,960
-保护他  -趴下 趴下
- Covering him!  - No! no! no!

883
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:58,300
这他妈搞什么呢
What was going on?

884
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,890
我可没设计这个
This wasn't in the design.

885
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,810
柯布
Cobb. Cobb?

886
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,940
干掉他
Get him!

887
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:10,030
-你没事吧  -我没事 我很好 我很好
- Are you alright? - Yeah,I'm alright,I'm okey. I'm okey.

888
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,710
-费舍尔也没事 没准有点晕车  -斋藤
- Fischer's okey. Unless he gets carsick. - Saito?

889
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,870
把费舍尔关到里面去 快
Get Fischer in the back room,now.

890
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,570
-带进去 快  -天 这是怎么了...
- Get him in the back room. Move! - What the hell?

891
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,400
-他中枪了 会死吗  -我不知道
- Has he been shot? Is he dying? - I don't know.

892
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,880
老天呐
Jesus Christ!

893
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,970
你们去哪儿了 出什么事了
Where were you? what happened to you?

894
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,310
我们被一列火车截住了
We were blocked by a freight train.

895
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,390
你怎么能在市中心的路口
Why would you put a train crossing in

896
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,520
放一列火车
The middle of a downtown intersection?

897
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,860
-我没有  -那火车哪儿来的
- I didn't.- Where did it come from?

898
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:50,480
我才要问你呢 我们怎么会被人攻击的
Lemme ask you a question! Why the hell we were ambushed,huh?

899
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,480
那些人都不是普通的防御者
Those were not normal projections.

900
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,230
见鬼的他们都是受过训练的好不好
He'd been trained,for god's sakes!

901
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,600
-没错  -谁会训练他们
- You're right.- How could he be trained?

902
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:57,190
费舍尔肯定请盗梦者训练过他的潜意识
Fischer's had an extractor teach his subconscious

903
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,960
潜意识防卫 所以...
to defend itself. so...

904
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:02,120
他的防御者都是武装过的 我早该做好调查的
His subconscious is militarized. This should have shown in the research.

905
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,060
-对不起  -那你他妈怎么没调查出来
- I'm sorry.- Why the hell you didn't?

906
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,970
-冷静点  -别叫我冷静
- Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down!

907
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:09,080
这是你分内的事 你他妈要负全责
This was your job,goddamnit! This was your responsibility!

908
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,410
你应该把他的底细调查清楚
You were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly!

909
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,290
对这种袭击 我们完全没有防备
We are not prepared for this type of fire!

910
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,100
我们之前不也碰过潜意识防卫情况吗
We have dealt with the subsecurity before.

911
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,930
只要小心一点不就行了
We'll be a little more careful.we're gonna be fine.

912
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,590
之前可没有这种状况 他快死了 见鬼
"Before" is not a part of the plan! He's dying,for god's sake!

913
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,220
-把他叫醒  -别 千万别
- Let's put him out of his misery. - Don't do that! Don't do that!

914
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,150
他太痛苦了 我要把他叫醒
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

915
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,680
不行 你唤不醒他的
No,it won't wake him up.

916
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,560
-说什么呢 什么叫醒不来 -就是他醒不了
- What do you mean,it won't wake him up? - It won't wake him up.

917
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,080
在梦里死去 不就能醒过来嘛
When we die in a dream,we wake up.

918
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,870
这次不行了
Not from this.

919
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,870
我们用的镇静剂太强了
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.

920
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:38,000
好吧 那死了会怎样
Right. so what happens when we die?

921
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:39,720
-坠入迷失域    -开什么玩笑
- Drop into limbo. - Are you serious?

922
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,570
-什么迷失域  -最荒芜的梦境
- Limbo?  - Unconstructed dream space.

923
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,310
那里有什么
What the hell is down there?

924
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,660
除了原始和无穷的潜意识 
Just raw infinite subconscious.

925
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:46,750
什么都没有
Nothing is down there,

926
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,080
除非有人之前困在那里 
except for whatever might have been left behind

927
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,090
自行建造 留下了一些场景碎片
by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before,

928
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,430
在我们中间就只有你去过
Which in our case is just you.

929
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,220
我们在那里会困多久
But how long could we be stuck there?

930
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,000
在镇静剂消退前 是不可能逃出来的
Not even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases...

931
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,200
到底是多久多久
How long?

932
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,430
几十年 也许是永远 我怎么知道
Decades,it could be infinite,I don't know.

933
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,570
问他吧 只有他去过
Ask him. he's the one who's been there.

934
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,190
先把他抬楼上去再说
Let's just get him upstairs.

935
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,760
"好极了"  "多亏了你啊"
Great. Thank you.

936
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,820
我们现在 困在费舍尔的潜意识里
So,now we are trapped in Fischer's mind

937
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,000
跟他的武装防御军队搏命
battling his own private army.

938
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,620
要是一不小心死了
And if we get killed,

939
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,690
就会跌进迷失域
we'll be lost in limbo

940
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,120
直到脑子烧坏 是吧
till our brains turn to scrambled egg. hmm?

941
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,960
有急救箱吗
You got first aid?

942
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,650
你明知道有危险 却没有告诉我们
So you knew about these risks. You didn't tell us?

943
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,940
不应该有危险的
There wasn't meant to be any risk.

944
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,060
我怎么知道我们会被袭击
I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.

945
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,280
你不该瞒着我们的
You had no right.

946
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,200
这是深入三层梦境的唯一方式
This is the only way to go three layers deep.

947
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:41,620
还有你啊 明知其中风险 也不吱个声
And you,you knew about this and went along with it?

948
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,300
我相信他啊
I trusted him.

949
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,610
信你个头 你相信钱吧 他把他那份钱分你一半
You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share?

950
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,840
没有 他说全给我
No,his whole share.

951
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,340
而且他说他以前干过
Besides,he said he had done it before.

952
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,840
干过 和茉儿那次吗
You had done it before? What? With Mal?

953
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,770
-那次什么下场  -那次和现在没关系
- Cause that works so good? - That has nothing to do with it.

954
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,900
我只是竭尽所能回到我的孩子身边
I did what I had to do to get back to my children.

955
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,790
所以你就把我们领向一条不归路
So you led us into a war zone with no way out?

956
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,990
不是绝路 好吗
There's a way out,alright?

957
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,230
大家继续按计划行事 速战速决
We continue on with the job,and we do this as fast as possible,

958
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,000
然后和以前一样 用坠落离开梦境
And we get out using the kick,just like before.

959
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,310
拉倒吧 走得越深我们就越危险
Forget it. If we go any deeper,we just raise the stakes.

960
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,520
我就在这层 坐着等醒 又会怎么样
I am sitting this one hour on this level,worse?

961
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,220
我们吵架这会功夫
Fischer's security is surrounding this place

962
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,110
费舍尔的防御军队正在包围这里
Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak.

963
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,460
十小时的航线 在这一层就是一个礼拜
The ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.

964
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:16,730
我可以肯定的是 要使待在这儿我们全部都死定了 
That means each and every one of us will be killed,that I can guarantee.

965
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:20,620
我们除了速战速决 别无选择
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.

966
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,180
要想逃出去 只能继续往下走
Downwards,is the only way forwards.

967
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,000
准备好 你跟我来
Get ready. You,come on.

968
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,040
我们去震下他
Let's go shake him up.

969
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,140
赎金在一千万之内 我可以马上支付
I'm insured against kidnaping for up to ten million.

970
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,800
要钱很简单
This should be very simple.

971
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,900
闭嘴 没那么简单
Shut up! It won't be.

972
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,460
你老爸办公室的书橱下 有个保险箱
In your father's office,below the bookshelves,is his personal safe.

973
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:48,280
-密码是什么  -我不知道有什么保险箱
- We need the combination. - I don't know any safe.

974
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:54,520
那不代表你不知道密码 快告诉我们
It doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.

975
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,740
我真不知道
I don't know.

976
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,300
我们情报是不会出错的
We have it on good authority you do know.

977
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:07,230
是吗 那谁说的
Yeah? Who's this authority?

978
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,380
-这玩意居然值五百美元  -打开看看
- Five hundred dollars this cost. - Open inside.

979
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:15,220
现金 各种卡 身份证 还有这个
Cash,cards,ID,and this.

980
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,980
-用得上吗  -也许吧
- Useful? - Maybe.

981
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,680
-轮你上场了 一个小时  -就一小时啊
- You're on. you've got an hour. - An hour?

982
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,660
不是说好给我一晚上时间吗
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.

983
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,700
那斋藤胸口说好中枪了吗
Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.

984
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,140
一小时 挖出点有用的 拜托
Got one hour to get something useful,please.

985
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:40,910
什么声音
What's that?

986
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,250
听不出来吗
Good authority.

987
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,260
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

988
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,420
-先让他们住手  -密码是多少
- Just... just make them stop. - The combination?

989
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:55,410
-我真不知道  -那为什么布朗宁说你知道
- I don't know it.- What does Browning say you do.

990
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:57,960
他说的 那个...让我先跟他谈谈
I don't know. Just lemme... lemme talk to him,

991
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,230
再说吧
and I'll find out.

992
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,540
给你一小时 谈吧
You have one hour. Start talking.

993
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,560
你还好吧
Are you okey?

994
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,430
这帮混蛋关了我整整两天
Those bastards've had me for two days.

995
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,810
他们派人潜入了你父亲的办公室
They have someone with access to your father's office.

996
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,080
-试图打开他的保险箱  -我知道
- And they're trying to open his safe.- Yeah.

997
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,910
他们以为我知道密码 可我不知道
They thought I'd know the combination,but I don't know it.

998
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,070
-其实 我也不知道 所以...  -什么
- Yeah,well,neither do I. so... - What?

999
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,040
你父亲跟我说我 在他走后
Maurice told me that when he passed,

1000
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,270
你是唯一知道密码的人
you are the only one to be able to open it.

1001
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,710
没有...他从没告诉过我什么密码
No,he never... he never gave me any combination.

1002
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,880
说不定他说过了呢
Maybe he did,I mean,

1003
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,030
只是你不知道那就是密码
maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.

1004
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,790
-那 像是什么  -不清楚
- Well,what then? - I don't know.

1005
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,920
不过肯定是一些 意义重大的数字 
Some meaningful combination of numbers based on your...

1006
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,320
你和你父亲的一些共同经历有关的
your experiences with Maurice.

1007
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:54,590
我们没什么...有意义的共同经历
We didn't have very many,um... meaningful experiences together.

1008
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,300
或许 在你妈妈去世后
Perhaps,after your mother died.

1009
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,480
我妈去世后 你知道他跟我说什么吗
After my mother died,you know what he told me?

1010
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:08,240
"罗伯特 其实没什么好说的"
"Robert,there's really nothing to be said."

1011
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,880
别较真 他不善表达情感
Oh,he was bad with emotions.

1012
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,030
我当时才十一岁啊 彼得叔叔
I was eleven,uncle Peter.

1013
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:17,800
-他怎么样  -很痛苦
- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.

1014
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,760
等我们到下面几层 疼痛感就会减弱
When we get down to the lower levels,the pain will be less intense.

1015
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,630
-他要是死了呢  -你说最坏情况
- And if he dies? - The worst case scenario?

1016
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,530
醒来后 会完全丧失意识
When he wakes up,his mind is completely gone.

1017
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,780
柯布 我仍会履行我们的协议
Cobb,I'll still honor the arrangement.

1018
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,860
我很感激 但是斋藤...
I appreciate that,Saito. But..

1019
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:38,740
你醒来后 根本不会记得我们曾有过协议
When you wake up,you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.

1020
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,110
你会留在迷失域 
Limbo's gonna become your reality.

1021
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,030
你会困在那里
You're gonna be lost down there so

1022
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:45,380
等到年华逝去  
long that you're gonna become an old man.

1023
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:49,810
-在悔恨中度过余生  -孤零零地等死
- Filled with regret. - Waiting to die alone?

1024
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:57,020
不 我会回来 和你们一起重回年轻
No,I'll come back. and we'll be young men,together again.

1025
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,960
深呼吸
Breathe.

1026
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,300
如果我们不说出密码
These people are gonna kill us here,

1027
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,820
这伙人会马上杀了我们
if we don't give them the combination.

1028
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,160
-他们不过是想要钱  -我听到他们说了
- They just want a ransom. - I heard them.

1029
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:13,030
他们会把我们塞进货车 把车丢进河里喂鱼
They're gonna whack us in that van and then drive it into the river.

1030
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:16,150
好吧 那保险箱里到底有什么
Alright,what is it in the safe?

1031
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,400
是留给你的东西
Something for you.

1032
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,970
你父亲总说 那是他留给你最珍贵的礼物
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.

1033
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,700
-一份遗嘱  -遗嘱不是给律师了吗
- A will.  - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1034
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:26,960
这份是候补遗嘱
That's an alternate.

1035
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,540
如果你愿意 完全可以推翻前一份
This would supersede the other,if you want it to.

1036
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,400
这份遗嘱是讲 要你解散费舍明日能源集团
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer-Morrow,

1037
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:36,290
你父亲的能源帝国会从此消失
and it'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.

1038
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,950
不留给我一丝一毫吗
Destroy my whole inheritance?

1039
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:44,420
-他为什么要我这么做  -我也不知道
- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.

1040
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:50,110
他很爱你 罗伯特 以他独特的方式
He loved you,Robert,in his own way.

1041
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,080
以他独特的方式
In his own way?

1042
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:58,850
他临终前 把我叫到他床边
At the end,he called me to his deathbed.

1043
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,360
虽然几乎说不了话了
He could barely speak.

1044
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:06,650
但仍耗尽最后一口气 说了最后一句话
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.

1045
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,950
他让我凑上去
He pulled me close.

1046
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:18,270
我只勉强听清了两个字
And I could only make out one word --

1047
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,050
"失望"
"disappointed."

1048
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,310
你什么时候进入过迷失域
When were you in limbo?

1049
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,430
虽然你成功说服了大家继续执行任务
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job,

1050
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,100
-但他们并不知道真相  -什么真相
- But they don't know the truth? - Truth? What truth?

1051
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,690
真相就是 任何时候你都有可能
The truth that at any minute,

1052
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:42,540
让一列火车撞进来
you might bring a freight train through the wall.

1053
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,790
真相就是 你无法控制你潜意识里的茉儿
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.

1054
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,610
真相就是 我们不断深入费舍尔意识的同时
And the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer,

1055
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,700
也会不断受到你潜意识的干扰
We're also going deeper into you.

1056
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,970
我不知道接下来还会发生什么
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.

1057
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,660
我当时在和她一起工作
We were working together.

1058
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:04,520
我们在研究在梦里做梦的可能性
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.

1059
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:07,130
我不断给自己压力 想要研究的更深
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper and deeper.

1060
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,030
研究的更透彻
I wanted to go further.

1061
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,420
我当时还没意识到
I just didn't understand the concept

1062
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,160
现实的几小时会变成梦中的几年
that hours could turn into years down there,

1063
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,670
我们陷得太深了
And we could get trapped so deep that only

1064
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:22,580
最终到达潜意识边缘的时候
wound up on the shore of our own subconscious.

1065
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:26,340
已经无法分辨梦境和现实
We lost sight of what was real.

1066
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,940
我们为自己创造了一个世界
We created and built a world for ourselves.

1067
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,520
我们建了很多年
We did that for years.

1068
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,980
建起了只属于我们自己的世界
We built our own world.

1069
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:47,420
-你们被困了多久  -大概有五十年吧
- How long were you stuck there? - Something like fifty years.

1070
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:55,220
天呐 你们怎么能受得了
Jeez. How could you stand it?

1071
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,250
一开始还不错 感觉自己像上帝一样
It wasn't so bad at first,feeling like gods.

1072
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,430
但问题是这些都不是真的
The problem was none of them was real.

1073
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,050
最后 我终于无法忍受了
Eventually,it just became impossible for me to live like that.

1074
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,960
那她怎么想
And what about for her?

1075
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:15,450
她把自己内心深处的秘密锁起来了
She had locked something away,something deep inside her.

1076
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:19,520
对于她曾经了解的现实
The truth that she had once known,

1077
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,070
她选择将其遗忘
but she chose to forget.

1078
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,600
她把迷失域当成了现实世界
Limbo became her reality.

1079
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,390
你们醒来后发生了什么
What happened when you woke up?

1080
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:34,920
在梦里呆了那么久 等到几十年后醒来
Well,to wake up from that after... after years,after decades,

1081
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,400
苍老的灵魂重新回到年轻的躯体
We come old souls thrown back into youth like that.

1082
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,010
我知道她有点不对劲
I knew something was wrong with her.

1083
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,040
只是她自己不愿承认
she just wouldn't admit it.

1084
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:48,160
她最终告诉了我真相
Eventually,she told me the truth.

1085
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:52,060
长期以来 一个一直挥之不去的想法
She was possessed by an idea.

1086
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:57,960
这个非常简单却能颠覆一切的想法
This one very simple idea that changed everything,

1087
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,640
她觉得我们还在做梦 
That our world wasn't real,

1088
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:06,990
她必须醒过来回到现实世界
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality,that...

1089
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:13,540
想要回去 我们俩都必须自杀
In order to get back home,we had to kill ourselves.

1090
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,930
那你们的孩子呢
What about your children?

1091
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,380
她说他们也不是真的
she thought they were projections,

1092
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,680
我们真正的孩子正在现实中等着我们
That our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.

1093
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,890
-我是孩子的妈妈  -冷静点
- I am their mother. - Calm down.

1094
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,650
你以为我看不出区别吗
Don't you think I can't tell the difference?

1095
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,770
如果我在做梦 为什么我会控制不了它
If this is my dream,why can't I control this?

1096
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,730
因为你不知道自己在做梦
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

1097
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,570
她是如此坚决 不管我怎么解释
She was certain there was nothing I can do,

1098
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:40,890
也不管我怎么求她 都无济于事
No matter how much I begged,no matter how much I pleaded.

1099
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,900
她想回去 但她又不想一个人走
She wanted to do it,but she could not do it alone.

1100
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,690
她太爱我了 所以...
She loved me too much,so...

1101
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:51,690
在我们结婚纪念日那天 她想了一个办法
She came up with the plan on our anniversary.

1102
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,460
-亲爱的 你在干什么  -一起来吧
- Sweetheart,what are you doing? - Join me.

1103
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,340
你先退回屋里 好吗
Just... just step back inside. Alright?

1104
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,840
退回屋里 求你了
Just step back inside. now,come on.

1105
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,280
不
No.

1106
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,710
我要跳下去 我们一起跳下去
I'm going to jump. And you are coming with me.

1107
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,170
不 我不能跳
No,I'm not.

1108
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,960
你听我说
Now... now you listen to me.

1109
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,730
如果你跳下去 是不会醒的 明白吗
If you jump,you're not gonna wake up. Remember?

1110
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,820
会死不会醒 所以先退回屋里去 好吗 
You're gonna die. now just... just step back inside.

1111
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,500
求你了
Come on!

1112
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:44,930
回到屋里 我们好好谈谈  
Step back inside so we can talk about this.

1113
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,540
我们谈得够多了
we've talked enough.

1114
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,490
茉儿
Mal.

1115
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:52,290
你快跨出来 不然我现在就跳下去
Come out onto the ledge,or I'll jump right now.

1116
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,650
好
Okey.

1117
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:00,720
我们先谈谈 好吗
Let's talk about this. Alright?

1118
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:06,660
-这一次你要完全相信我  -不 亲爱的
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. - No,honey,

1119
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,480
我不能跳 你知道我不会跳的
I can't. you know I can't do that.

1120
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,320
为孩子们想想
Take a second to think about our children.

1121
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:17,850
想想詹姆斯 想想菲利帕
Think about James,think about Phillipa,now.

1122
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,130
但你不和我跳 孩子们还是会被带走的
If I go without you,they'll take them away,anyway.

1123
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:24,730
-什么意思  -我找律师留下了一封信
- What does that mean? - I filed a letter with our attorney,

1124
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,610
信中说我一直为自己的安全担心
explaining how I'm fearful for my safety,

1125
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:33,650
因为你威胁要杀了我
How you threatened to kill me.

1126
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,260
-你为什么这么做  -我爱你 道姆  
- why did you do this? - I love you,Dom.

1127
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,220
你为什么这么对我 为什么 为什么
Why did you... why... why would you do this to me?

1128
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:43,160
这样你就不会因离开孩子而内疚
Freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.

1129
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,130
我们要回真正的家和孩子团聚了
We are going home,to our real children.

1130
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,640
不不不 茉儿 听我说 好吗  
No,no... no. Mal,you listen to me,alright?

1131
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,600
茉儿 看着我 求你了  
Mal,look at me,please!

1132
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,690
你在等一趟火车
you're waiting for a train,

1133
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,640
茉儿 上帝啊 不要这样
Mal,goddamnit! Don't do this!

1134
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,570
它会把你带去远方
a train that will take you far away.

1135
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,460
詹姆斯和菲利帕在等你回去
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1136
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,930
你了然心之所向
You know where you hope this train will take you,

1137
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,660
-他们在等我们  -却不知火车开向何方
- They're waiting for us! - But you don't know for sure.

1138
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,350
-茉儿 看着我  -但这并不重要
- Mal,look at me! - But it doesn't matter,

1139
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,480
-茉儿 上帝啊  -因为我们会在一起  
- Mal,goddamnit! - Because we'll be together.

1140
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,620
亲爱的 看着我
Sweetheart,look at me.

1141
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,730
茉儿 不要 老天爷啊 
Mal! No! Jesus Christ!

1142
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:20,280
她找了三个心理医生 证明她心智正常
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists,

1143
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,290
她让我没有任何办法去解释
That made it impossible for me to

1144
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:24,820
她的内心有多么疯狂
Try to explain the nature of her madness.

1145
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,700
所以我只能逃亡
So I ran.

1146
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,560
再不走就来不及了 柯布
Right now,or never,Cobb.

1147
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,700
好吧 我们走
Alright,let's go.

1148
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,140
我丢下了我的孩子
I left my children behind,

1149
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,180
自那以后我就一直想办法回去
And I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.

1150
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,290
你的罪恶感塑造了她 她才如此强大
Your guilt defines her,it's what powers her.

1151
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:55,370
她的意念毁了自己 你不需要为她的死负责 
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.

1152
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:58,110
如果我们想要完成任务的话
And if we're gonna succeed in this,

1153
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:01,370
你必须原谅自己
you have to forgive yourself,

1154
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,650
坦然面对心中的她
And you're gonna have to confront her.

1155
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,870
但你不必孤身奋战  
But you don't have to do that alone.

1156
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:06,750
不不 你不能...
No,you don't...

1157
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,530
我这是为了大家
I'm doing it for the others.

1158
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,390
因为他们完全不知道
Because they have no idea of the risk

1159
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:14,520
和你一起深入梦境有多危险
they've taken coming down here with you.

1160
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,370
我们得走了
We have to move.

1161
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,580
-时间到了  -听着
- Time's up. - All right.

1162
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:26,170
我不知道什么密码 至少在清醒时是不知道的
I don't know any combination,not consciously anyway.

1163
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,000
那问问你的第六感
How about instinctively,huh?

1164
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,000
现在 我们有人你父亲的保险箱前
I've got somebody standing in your father's office.

1165
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,390
就等着输入密码了
Right now,we need to tap in the combination.

1166
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,390
凭第一反应 说出六位数字 快
We need the first six numbers that come to your head right now.

1167
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,800
-我想不出  -快说
- I have no idea. - Right now!

1168
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,160
马上给我说出来
I said right now! Right now!

1169
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:44,850
528  491
5...2...8...491.

1170
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,920
这可不对
You'd have to do better than that.

1171
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,870
好了 把他们蒙起来
Alright,bag them.

1172
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:54,620
我们开车出去兜一圈
We're going for a ride.

1173
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,970
我们死了 你们就什么也得不到了
We're worth much more to you alive...

1174
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,830
你听到了吗
You hear me?

1175
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,580
有什么收获
What did you get?

1176
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,900
他们父子间的关系比我们想象的还糟
That boy's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined.

1177
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,040
这有什么用
This helps us how?

1178
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,430
问题越严重 就越需要精神宣泄
The stronger the issues,the more powerfully cathartic.

1179
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:19,570
你要怎么帮他们制造大和解
How are you gonna reconcile them of so estranged?

1180
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,770
-我不正在想嘛  -给我快点
- Well,I'm working on that,an't I? - Move fast.

1181
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,370
警卫队快包围这里了
The projections are closing in quick.

1182
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,510
我们得赶快突围
we gotta break out of here,

1183
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:28,030
不然就真挂在这了
Before we're totally boxed in.

1184
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,040
该死
Damn it!

1185
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:07,910
亲爱的 怕什么 做梦就得做大点
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger,darling.

1186
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,960
现在我们得把他对父亲的怨恨
Now,we need to shift his animosity

1187
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,910
转移到他的教父身上
from his father to his godfather.

1188
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,770
能做到吗 有那么容易吗
Would this destroy his one positive relationship?

1189
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,900
这样
No,

1190
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,040
我们就能一边修复他们父子间的关系
We'll repair his relationship with his

1191
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,740
一边揭露他邪恶教父的真面目
father by exposing his godfather's true nature.

1192
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:36,740
真是的 费舍尔该付我们心理咨询费的
Hell,we should charge Fischer much more than Saito.

1193
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,270
怎么对付他的武装防御军队
What about his security?

1194
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,680
走得越深 越难对付
It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.

1195
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,080
是不是可以找找"查尔斯先生"
Now,I think we run with Mr. Charles.

1196
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:42,380
不要
No.

1197
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,140
-"查尔斯先生"是谁  -我不喜欢"查尔斯先生"
- Who's Mr. Charles? - Bad idea.

1198
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,410
在第二层 只要我们走进酒店 一接近费舍尔
The second we get into that hotel and approach Fischer,

1199
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:47,990
他的警卫队就会蜂拥而至
His security's gonna be all over us.

1200
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,350
我们可以找"查尔斯先生"帮帮忙
We run with Mr. Charles

1201
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,360
就跟以前一样
like we did on the Stein Job.

1202
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:52,570
-这么说你们做过  -试过 但失败了
- So you've done it before? - Yeah,it didn't work.

1203
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,280
目标意识到了自己在做梦
The subject realized that he was dreaming,

1204
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,980
他的防御者将我们撕成了碎片
And his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1205
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,730
这经历有意思 但吸取教训了 对吧
Excellent. but you've learnt a lot,right?

1206
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,360
-得有人分散目标注意力才行  -没问题
- I need some kind of distraction. - No problem.

1207
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,950
还记得上次那个美女吗
How about a lovely lady I've used before.

1208
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,770
-听着 你小心开车  -好
- Listen to me. you drive carefully,alright? - Yeah.

1209
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:07,360
接下来的一层会非常不稳定
The thing down there's gonna be unstable as hell.

1210
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,570
别跳得太早
Don't jump too soon.

1211
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,680
我们只有一次坠落的机会
We only have one shot at that kick you're gonna make.

1212
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:17,840
到时候我会放音乐
I'll play the music,then you'll know it's coming.

1213
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,970
剩下的就看你们的了
the rest is on you.

1214
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,290
-准备好了  -好了
- Are you ready? - Ready!

1215
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,530
好梦
Sweet dreams!

1216
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,430
很无聊 是吗
Am I boring you?

1217
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,170
都是我一直在讲 你是不是没兴趣了
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't your liking.

1218
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:34,600
啊 没有 我心里很乱
Oh,um... I have a lot in my mind.

1219
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:37,630
"查尔斯先生"出场了
There goes Mr. Charles.

1220
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:45,080
费舍尔先生
Mr. Fischer? Right?

1221
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,420
很高兴再见到您 我是营销部的 Rod Green
Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing.

1222
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:52,320
-那么你是...  -我是 失陪了
- And you must be...? - Leaving.

1223
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,820
如果你寂寞的话
In case you get bored...

1224
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,940
你们没戏的
Must have blown you off.

1225
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,990
除非她的号码真只有六位数
That is unless her phone number,really is only six digits.

1226
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,130
( 528 491)
-这么随便搭讪陌生人
Funny way down,make friends,

1227
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:13,860
钱包很容易被偷啊
someone stealing their wallet like that.

1228
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,920
该死 光那钱包就值...
Ha,goddamnit! Wallet alone is worth at least...

1229
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,730
五百美元吗
About 500 dollars,right?

1230
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,050
不用担心 我已经派我的人去找了
Listen,don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.

1231
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:26,200
谁是"查尔斯先生"
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1232
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:29,910
这招是用来诱使费舍尔对抗自己的潜意识
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.

1233
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:31,490
那你为什么不同意
Then why don't you approve?

1234
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:33,610
因为必须告诉目标他在做梦
'cause it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming,

1235
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,150
这样的话就会招来很多麻烦
Which involves attracting a lot of attention on us.

1236
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,190
柯布不是说不能这么做吗
Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

1237
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,620
发现了啊 柯布口中的禁忌
So now you've noticed how much time

1238
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,560
他自己总是一犯再犯
Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.

1239
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,140
斋藤先生 有空吗
Mr. Saito,can I have a moment?

1240
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,160
啊 不好意思
Oh,I... I'm sorry.

1241
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,440
等等
Wait!

1242
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:55,320
-你气色好多了  -兴致真好 伊姆斯先生 
- You look a bit perkier. - Very amusing,Mr. Eames.

1243
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,830
飞机遇到气流了 
Turbulence on the plane?

1244
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:06,850
不 第一层 是尤瑟夫在开车
No,it's much closer. It's Yusuf's driving.

1245
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:19,350
-不好意思  你刚说你是谁来着  -营销部的Rod Green
- I'm sorry,who did you say you were? - Rod Green from marketing.

1246
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,220
其实这不是真的 对吧
That's not true at all,is it?

1247
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,900
我的名字是"查尔斯先生" 我们见过
My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me,don't you?

1248
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:30,100
我是你在这的安全主管
I'm the head of your security down here.

1249
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:32,450
到其他楼层下电梯 一直走别停下
Get out on a different floor and keep moving.

1250
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:35,850
-扔了钱包 警卫会来找的  -好
- Dump the wallet. The security will look for that. - Okey.

1251
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:39,120
我们得为Coob多争取点时间
We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1252
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,780
安全主管
Security,huh?

1253
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,150
-你是这间酒店里的  -不 不
- You work for the hotel? - No,no.

1254
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:52,130
我专门负责安全类别 非常非常特殊
I specialize in a very specific type of security,

1255
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:55,130
潜意识安全
subconscious security.

1256
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,160
你是说梦境吗
Are you talking about dreams?

1257
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:01,130
或者说盗梦
Are you talking about,um... extraction?

1258
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,660
我是来这保护你的
I'm here to protect you.

1259
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,900
费舍尔先生 我之所以过来保护你
Mr.Fischer,I'm here to protect you

1260
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:22,430
是因为有人利用梦境来进入你的大脑
In the event that someone tries access to your mind through your dreams.

1261
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:28,240
这里不安全 他们已经冲着你来了
You are not safe here. They are coming for you.

1262
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,890
天气很诡异吧
Strange weather,isn't it?

1263
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,870
感觉到了吗
You feel that?

1264
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,000
出什么事了
What's happening?

1265
01:28:57,070 --> 01:29:00,470
柯布正设法让费舍尔意识到自己在做梦
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream,

1266
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,340
他的潜意识已经开始寻找做梦者了
which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer,

1267
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,010
也就是我 快 亲下
For me. Quick,give me a kiss.

1268
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:15,850
-他们还在看啊  -呀 没骗过 不过值了
- They're still looking at us. - Yeah,it's worth a shot.

1269
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,000
我们还是走吧
We should probably get out of here.

1270
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,200
感觉到了吗
Do you feel that?

1271
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,230
费舍尔先生 你应该受过专门的训练
You've actually been trained for this,Mr. Fischer.

1272
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,680
注意天气的反常和重力的变向
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather,the shift of the gravity.

1273
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:45,110
这一切都不是真的 你在做梦
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1274
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:52,520
有个最简单的证明方法 回想一下
Now,the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try to remember,

1275
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:56,070
你是怎么来到这家酒店的吗 
How you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?

1276
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,500
记得  但我...
Yeah,I don't,I...

1277
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,880
放松 深呼吸 想想你受过的训练
Now,breathe,breathe. Remember your training,

1278
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,990
你必须意识到你是在梦里 我是来保护你的
Accept the fact that you're in the dream,and I'm here to protect you.

1279
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,580
继续想想
Go on.

1280
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:15,530
-你不是真人  -对 我不是
- You're not real? - No,no.

1281
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,980
我是你潜意识里的防御者
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1282
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,230
我的任务就是保护你
I was sent here to protect you in the event

1283
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:22,820
阻止任何盗梦者偷走你的信息
that the extractors try to pull you into a dream.

1284
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:27,250
费舍尔先生 他们现在肯定在行动
And I believe that's what's going on right now,Mr. Fischer.

1285
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,980
好吧
Yeah,okey.

1286
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,510
我知道了
Okey.

1287
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:40,050
-能救我出去吗 -当然 跟我来
- Can you get me out of here? - Right away. Follow me.

1288
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,470
天啊 你这是干什么
This is what? What're you doing?

1289
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,920
他们是被派来绑架你的  知道吗
These men were sent here  to abduct you,alright?

1290
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:08,210
想要我救你 你得保持冷静
If you want my help,you have to remain calm.

1291
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:12,030
费舍尔先生 你得和我合作才行
I need you to work with me,Mr. Fischer.

1292
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,510
如果这是梦 只要自杀就能醒 对吗
If this is a dream,I should just kill myself to wake up. Right?

1293
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,670
费舍尔先生 换做我就不会这么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you,mr. fischer.

1294
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:31,460
他们肯定对你用了镇静剂
I believe that they have you sedated.

1295
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,080
如果你扣动扳机 就醒不过来了
If... if you pull that trigger,you may not wake up.

1296
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:38,280
很可能坠入更深层的梦里
You may go into a further dream state now.

1297
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,690
明白我的意思吗
You know what I'm talking about.

1298
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:47,090
回想下受过的训练和我说的话
You remember the training. Remember what I said to you.

1299
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,190
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1300
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:57,560
房间：491 528

1301
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:03,240
-这房间在528房间正下方吧 -没错
- This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah.

1302
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,660
回忆一下 费舍尔先生
Think,Mr. Fischer,think.

1303
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,570
记不记得在这个梦境之前你在做什么
What do you remember from before this dream?

1304
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:21,050
好像发生了很激烈的枪战...
Oh... there was,um... there was a lot of gunfires.

1305
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:23,570
还下着大雨...
There was... rain.

1306
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,870
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

1307
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,030
-天呐 我们被绑架了  -你们被关在哪里
- Oh my god,we've been kidnaped. - Where were they holding you?

1308
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:36,080
-关在一辆面包车后面  -原来你们在行驶的面包车里
- They had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts.

1309
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,350
难怪重力会变向 继续
You're in the back of a van right now. Ke...keep going!

1310
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:44,110
好像...和一个保险箱有关
It had something to do with,um... something to do with a... a safe.

1311
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,320
天呐 好难啊 想不起来
God,why is it so hard to remember?

1312
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,000
这就像你醒来回想自己的梦一样难
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.

1313
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:51,600
大部分的人是做不到的
Listen to this,it takes years of practice.

1314
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:54,110
你和布朗宁被拖进了这个梦境
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream,

1315
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,480
说明有人想从你的大脑里偷走某样东西
Because they're trying to steal something from your mind.

1316
01:32:56,490 --> 01:33:00,350
集中精神 再好好想想那是什么
I need you to focus and try to remember what that is.

1317
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,450
他们想要什么 再想想 费舍尔先生
What is it,Mr. Fischer? Think!

1318
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,670
是一组密码
Uh... a combination.

1319
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:06,760
他们要我凭第一感觉 说出几个数字
They demanded the first numbers that popped into my head.

1320
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:09,230
他们想从你的潜意识里偷取一串数字
They were trying to extract the number from your subconscious.

1321
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,840
这可能代表任何东西 我们现在酒店里
It can represent anything. We are in a hotel right now.

1322
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:17,180
也许是房间号码 那组数字是什么 费舍尔先生 
Should try hotel rooms. What was the number,Mr. Fischer?

1323
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,820
快努力回想下 这很重要
Try and remember for me. This is very important.

1324
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:23,480
5 5 2 这串数字很长
5...52... it was something long number...

1325
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,280
能记起两个
That's good enough.

1326
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,370
已经很好了
We could start there.

1327
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,160
-是五楼  -收到
- Fifth floor. - Yep.

1328
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:32,460
-要用定时炸弹吗  -不行 要自己判断引爆时间
- So do you use a timer? - No,I have to judge it for myself.

1329
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,280
你们去528 继续做梦时
While you're all asleep in 528.

1330
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,220
我来等尤瑟夫的坠落信号
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1331
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,310
-你怎么知道  -他会放音乐提醒我
- Well,how will you know? - His music warns me.

1332
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,630
然后面包车会撞上桥边的护栏
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge,

1333
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:45,690
准确无误 我们就能完美地同步坠落
That should be unmistakable. So we get a nice,synchronized kick.

1334
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,270
如果太早引爆 你们来不及
If it's too soon,we won't get pulled out.

1335
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,690
如果晚了 你们也无法坠落
And if it's too late,I won't be able to drop this.

1336
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,360
-为什么  -面包车已经在自由落体
- Why not? - Because of the van that will be in free fall.

1337
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,160
-没有重力就无法坠落  -有道理
- Can't drop you without gravity. - Right.

1338
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,090
自己人
They're with me.

1339
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:21,390
(房间：528)

1340
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:33,130
-"查尔斯先生"  -费舍尔先生  
- Mr. Charles. - Do you know

1341
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:34,100
你知道这是什么吗
what that is,Mr. Fischer?

1342
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,890
我想我知道  
Yeah,I... I think so. yeah.

1343
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,430
他们想把你拖入梦境里
They were trying to put you under.

1344
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,960
-可我已经在了  -下一层梦境
- I'm already under. - Under again.

1345
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:43,010
什么意思 你说在梦里还能做梦
What do you mean? A... Dream within a dream?

1346
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:47,070
-呦呵 换了身行头  -什么
- Hey,I see you've changed. - I'm sorry?

1347
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:53,170
抱歉 我把你当成我朋友了  
Oh... I'm sorry. I've mistaken you for a friend.

1348
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:55,900
那他一定很帅
Good looking fella,I'm sure.

1349
01:34:57,810 --> 01:34:59,720
那是费舍尔潜意识里的布朗宁
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.

1350
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,720
跟着他 看看他会做什么
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1351
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,000
-为什么  -从他身上就能看出来
- Why? - Because how he acts would tell us...

1352
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:07,060
费舍尔要是对布朗宁产生了怀疑的话
If Fischer's starting to suspect his motives as the way we wanted to.

1353
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:15,660
-彼得叔叔  -你们不是一起被绑架的吗
- Uncle Peter? - You said you were kidnaped together?

1354
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,010
也不是 其实...
Well,um... well,not... not exactly.

1355
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:19,020
他们先抓了他 还一直在拷打他
They... they already had him.they were torturing him.

1356
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:21,030
你亲眼看到的
And you saw them torture him?

1357
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,020
那些绑匪是你的人
AThe kidnapers are working for you?

1358
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,240
罗伯特
Oh,Robert...

1359
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:36,790
你要打开保险箱  拿走那份候补遗嘱
You're trying to get that safe open? So you get the alternate will?

1360
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:38,870
我为公司投入了一生的心血
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.

1361
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,930
我不能让你毁掉它
I can't let you destroy it.

1362
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,600
我怎么可能会亲手毁掉自己的家业呢
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance! Why would I?

1363
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:48,680
我不忍让你看到你父亲对你最后的嘲弄
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.

1364
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,310
什么嘲弄  
What taunt?

1365
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:50,530
就是那份遗嘱 罗伯特
The will,Robert.

1366
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,460
是他对你莫大的羞辱
That will,that's his last insult,a challenge for you...

1367
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,890
他觉得你只是个什么都靠他的富二代
you'd build something for yourself,

1368
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:02,930
你不配继承他的巨额财富
by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.

1369
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:12,810
-是啊 他的确对我很失望  -对不起
- Well,that he was,um... disappointed. - Hmm,I'm sorry.

1370
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:16,740
但是他错了
But... he's wrong.

1371
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,530
因为你会超越他的成就 靠你自己
You can build a better company than he ever did.

1372
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:24,160
-费舍尔先生 他在说谎  -你怎么知道
- Mr. Fischer,he's lying. - How do you know?

1373
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,550
相信我 我就是干这行的
Trust me,it's what I do.

1374
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:26,280
他有什么瞒着你
He's hiding something,

1375
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:28,970
一定要搞清楚他到底想做什么
And we need to find out what that is.

1376
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:34,310
我要你以其人之道还治其人之身
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.

1377
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,140
我们要进入他的潜意识
We'll enter his subconscious and

1378
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,520
把他的秘密全都挖出来
find out what he doesn't want you to know.

1379
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,030
好吧
All right.

1380
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,310
他睡过去了
He's out.

1381
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:52,250
等等 我们到底要进入谁的潜意识
Wait,whose subconscious are we going into exactly?

1382
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,600
费舍尔的
We're going into Fischer's.

1383
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,560
不过我告诉他 是进入布朗宁的
But I told him it was Browning's,

1384
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,430
所以他会帮我们
so he can be a part of our team.

1385
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:58,810
侵入自己的潜意识
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.

1386
01:36:58,830 --> 01:36:59,550
没错
That's right.

1387
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,860
防御者会追着你死缠烂打
The security's gonna run you down,huh?

1388
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,570
看本少爷如何让让他们疲于奔命吧
Then I will lead them on a merry chase.

1389
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:07,160
坠落之前一定要回来
Just be back before the kick.

1390
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,270
好好睡吧 伊姆斯
Go to sleep,Mr. Eames.

1391
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,990
你没事吧
Are you good?

1392
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:22,670
-喂 准备好了吗  -没事 我准备好了
- Hey! Are you ready? - Yes,yes,I'm... I'm fine. I'm ready.

1393
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:40,070
柯布 那里面会有什么
Cobb. cobb? What's down there?

1394
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,080
我们想要费舍尔了解的真相
Hopefully the truth we want Fischer to learn.

1395
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,260
我是指你的潜意识
I mean,what's down there for you?

1396
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,750
哈 看到了吗
Huh... did you see that?

1397
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000


1398
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,590
伊姆斯 这是你的梦境
Eames,this is your dream.

1399
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,800
我要你引开医院里的警卫 明白吗
I need you to draw the security away from the complex. Do you understand?

1400
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,940
-那谁带费舍尔进去  -我不行
- Who will guide Fischer in? - Not me.

1401
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:54,440
要是我知道了路线 我们就完蛋了
If I know the route,everything could be compromised.

1402
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,260
-这是我设计的迷宫  -不 你得跟着我
- I... I designed the place. - No,you're with me.

1403
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,850
-我来吧  -好吧
- I can do it. - Alright.

1404
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:02,060
你跟斋藤说一下怎么过去
You brief him on the route into the complex.

1405
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,850
费舍尔 你跟着他走
Fischer,you'll be going with him.

1406
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,940
好的 那你呢
Alright. What about you?

1407
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,400
无线电不要关 我会一直监听的
Keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1408
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,900
建筑上层的窗户都很宽敞
The windows on that upper floor're big

1409
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,780
我可以在南面的塔楼上掩护你
enough for me to cover you from that south tower.

1410
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,290
-看见了吗  -看到了  你不进来吗
- You see it? - Yeah. you're not coming in?

1411
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,240
要了解关于你父亲的真相
In order to find out the truth about your father,

1412
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:20,500
你要靠自己的力量 潜入布朗宁的潜意识
you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.

1413
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:22,510
来吧  费舍尔
Come,Fischer!

1414
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:21,170
拉警报 拉警报
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

1415
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,350
行动
Move!

1416
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,620
快上
Go!

1417
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,890
但愿你们准备好了
Hope you're ready.

1418
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:06,440
不不 这太早了
No,it's too soon.

1419
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:13,490
柯布 听到了吗
Cobb,do you hear that?

1420
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:17,660
二十分钟前就听到了 我还以为是风声
First heard it about twenty minutes ago. I thought it was the wind up here.

1421
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:20,190
我听到了 的确是音乐
Yeah,I hear it. It's music.

1422
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,540
-那怎么办  -抓紧时间
- So what do we do? - Move fast!

1423
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:31,290
尤瑟夫还有十秒就要跳了
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump,

1424
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,190
亚瑟还有三分钟
which gives Arthur three minutes.

1425
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,570
-我们呢  -六十分钟
- Which gives us what? - Sixty minutes.

1426
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:42,140
一小时内 他们能赶到那吗
Can they make that route in under an hour?

1427
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:44,110
不行 肯定到不了
They still have to climb down to the middle terrace.

1428
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,070
重新给他们找一条路 找条捷径
Well,then they need a new route,a more direct route.

1429
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,370
在那
There!

1430
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:59,790
我是照迷宫设计的
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1431
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:02,860
就算迷宫里也能抄近道吧
There must be access routes that cut through the maze,right?

1432
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,170
伊姆斯
Eames.

1433
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,000
-伊姆斯改过设计吗  -我不能告诉你
- Did Eames add any features? - I don't think I should tell you.

1434
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,740
-万一茉儿知道了...  -管不了那么多了
- If Mal finds out... - We don't have time for this.

1435
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,040
他到底改过没
Did he add any?

1436
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:36,040
他加了一条穿过迷宫的通风系统
He added an airduct system that can cut through the maze.

1437
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,770
好极了 告诉他们
Good,explain it to them.

1438
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:39,580
-斋藤  -说
- Saito? - Go ahead?

1439
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:16,000
-矛盾建筑  -不
- Paradox. - No...!

1440
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:26,060
-怎么回事  -是坠落
- What was that? - The kick.

1441
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,790
-柯布 我们是不是错过了  -对 是错过了
- Cobb! Cobb,did we miss it? - Yeah,we missed it.

1442
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,860
难道就不能在梦里造个海滩吗
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamned beach,huh?

1443
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,420
-现在怎么办  -在下次坠落前完成任务
- What the hell do we do now? - We finish the job before the next kick.

1444
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:46,030
-哪还有坠落了  -车子碰到水面的瞬间
- What next kick? - When the van hits the water.

1445
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,150
如需拨打电话 请挂机后重试
If you want to make a call,please hang up and try again.

1446
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,960
没有重力 怎么让你们坠落
How can I drop you without gravity?

1447
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,870
亚瑟还有几分钟 我们还有二十多分钟
Arthur has a couple of minutes,we have about twenty.

1448
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:46,360
你还行吗
Are you okey?

1449
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:54,070
快走 回基地
Move on! To the base!

1450
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,060
有点不对劲  警卫好像发现了什么
There's something wrong,they're heading your way,

1451
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:01,120
朝你们那边去了
like they know something.

1452
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:07,190
尽量拖住他们 能做到吗 咱们走
Just buy us some more time,alright? Come on!

1453
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:08,790
这就去
On my way.

1454
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,670
那就是通往保险库的前厅
That's the antechamber outside the strong room.

1455
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,460
保险库有窗户吗
Does the strong room have windows?

1456
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,380
要是有就不保险了
Well,I mean it wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1457
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:57,660
但愿费舍尔喜欢我们的设计
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.

1458
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:01,290
-那些防御者真的只是他的潜意识 -对
- Are those projections part of his subconscious? - Yes.

1459
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,050
-他的大脑会受到损害吗  -不会
- Are you destroying those parts of his mind? - No,no.

1460
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:05,350
他们都是想象出来的
They're just projections.

1461
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:32,400
好了 我们到了
Okey. We are here.

1462
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:35,890
你们那边暂时安全 大队人马正在往回赶 抓紧时间
You are clear but hurry. There's an entire army heading your way.

1463
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,510
进来了
We're in.

1464
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:10,180
看这里
Look here!

1465
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:55,650
-里面怎么还有人  -费舍尔 有埋伏 快出来
- Someone else's in there. - Fischer,it's a trap. Get out!

1466
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,190
快啊 再下来点
Come on,a little lower.

1467
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:07,270
柯布 不是 她...
Cobb. No,she...

1468
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:10,610
-她不是真的  -你怎么知道
- She is not real. - How do you know that?

1469
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:14,990
她只是个潜意识 费舍尔才是真的
She is just a projection. Fischer... Fischer is real.

1470
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,370
你好
Hello.

1471
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:28,610
伊姆斯 快去前厅
Eames! Eames! Get to the antechamber now!

1472
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:14,290
-怎么回事  - 茉儿把费舍尔杀了吗
- What happened? - Mal killed Fischer?

1473
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,830
我下不了手
I couldn't shoot her.

1474
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,330
他醒不过来了 他已经陷入了下一层
There's no use in reviving him,his mind's already trapped down there.

1475
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,690
-都结束了  -就这样失败了吗
- It's all over. - So that's it? Then we failed?

1476
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:30,640
完了 抱歉
We're done. I'm sorry.

1477
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:37,510
这想回家的又不是我 对吧
Well,it's not me who doesn't get back to my family,is it?

1478
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:39,960
真遗憾 我真想知道里面会发生什么
It's a shame. I really wanted to know what's gonna happen in there.

1479
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:41,330
我肯定这次会成功的
I swear we had this one.

1480
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:43,430
装炸药吧
Let's set the charges.

1481
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:47,430
等等 其实还有个方法
No,there's still another way.

1482
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:51,550
-我们跟着费舍尔一起下去  -时间不够了
- We just have to follow Fischer down there. - Not enough time.

1483
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,640
错 进入下一层就有足够时间
No,but there will... there will be enough time down there.

1484
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,090
我们会找到他的
And we will find him,okey?

1485
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:58,980
当亚瑟开始放音乐时
As soon as Arthur's music kicks in,

1486
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:01,360
再用心脏起搏器救活他
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1487
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:04,730
然后在下面一层坠落回来
We can give him his... his own kick down below.

1488
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:06,860
你把他抬进去
Look,you get him in there.

1489
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:09,850
音乐一结束 你就炸掉医院
As soon as the music ends,you blow up the hospital,

1490
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,280
这样我们就可以一起坠落回去了
and we all ride the kick back up the layers.

1491
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,190
值得一试
That's worth a shot.

1492
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:18,800
可我布置炸药时 需要斋藤掩护
Saito can hold the guards out,while I set the charges.

1493
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:21,910
斋藤活不了多久了
Saito will never make it,will he?

1494
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:26,080
-柯布 总得试试啊  -试试吧
- Cobb,come on. We've got to try this. - Go for it.

1495
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,790
不过坠落之前你们回不来 就不等你们了
If you are not back for the kick,I will go with or without you.

1496
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:31,360
她说得对 行动吧
She's right. She's right. Let's go.

1497
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:38,420
知道下去后该怎么做吗
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?

1498
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,040
我是说 茉儿也会在下面
I mean,Mal's gonna be down there.

1499
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:42,490
我知道去哪找她 费舍尔肯定在她手里
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.

1500
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,360
-你怎么知道  -因为...
- How do you know? - Because...

1501
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,750
她想让我去下面找她
She wants me to come after her,

1502
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,130
这样我们就能在一起了
she wants me back down there with her.

1503
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:16,870
还行吗你
Are you alright?

1504
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:28,970
-你们的世界  -曾经是 她肯定在这
- This is your world? - Was. This is where she'll be.

1505
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:31,490
走吧
Come on.

1506
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:11,000
来 哥们
Come here.

1507
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:19,810
斋藤 斋藤
Saito,Saito!

1508
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:23,270
帮我个忙 我布置炸药的时候
I need you,I need you to take care of Fischer,

1509
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:25,140
帮我照顾好费舍尔 好吗
while I go set some charges. Okey?

1510
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:28,860
这种工作 带游客可不行
No room for tourists on this job.

1511
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,550
我收回
Who said?

1512
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:07,140
这些都你们造的 太不可思议了
You built all this? This is incredible.

1513
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,820
我们造了许多年
We built it for years.

1514
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:13,090
然后按照记忆重建
And we started it on the memories.

1515
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,850
跟我来
This way.

1516
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,850
紧急制动

1517
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:04,250
这是我们住的街区
This is our neighborhood,

1518
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:06,940
都是根据记忆重建的
The place is from our past.

1519
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:09,310
那是我们的第一间公寓
That was our first apartment.

1520
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:13,130
后来搬到那面去了 茉儿怀孕后  
And we moved to that building right there,after Mal became pregnant,

1521
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:14,360
我们住在那儿
that became my home.

1522
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:17,280
这些都是根据记忆重建的吗
You reconstructed all of this from memory?

1523
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,970
跟你说过 我们有的是时间
Like I told you,we had lots of time.

1524
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:24,750
-那是什么  -茉儿在那房子里长大
- What's that? - It's the house Mal grew up in.

1525
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:26,950
-她会在里面吗  -不
- Will she be in there? - No.

1526
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,810
来吧
Come on.

1527
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,360
我们既可以别墅 又可以住高楼大厦
We both wanted to live in that house,but we loved this type of building.

1528
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:35,820
可真实世界里 必须二选一
In the real world,we'd have to choose,but not here.

1529
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:18,000
你准备怎么把费舍尔带回去
How would you bring Fischer back?

1530
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,920
我们还是要想办法坠落
We have to come up with some kind of a kick.

1531
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:25,010
-怎么坠落  -见机行事
- What? - We'd better improvise.

1532
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:29,170
有些事情要告诉你 关于我 还有植入想法
Listen,there's something you should know about me,about inception.

1533
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:48,640
一个想法就像病毒一样 顽强无比 感染性极强
An idea is like a virus,resilient,highly contagious.

1534
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:52,390
再细微的念头也会生根发芽
A smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1535
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:57,670
它能成就你 也能毁灭你
It can grow to define or destroy you.

1536
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:06,380
一个很小的念头 比如"你的世界不是真的"
The smallest idea such as "your world is not real,"

1537
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:10,250
非常简单却颠覆一切
Simple little thought that changes everything.

1538
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:16,230
你是如此确信你的世界是真的
So certain of your world of what's real.

1539
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:18,270
你觉得他分得清楚吗
Do you think he is?

1540
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:23,270
还是觉得其实他也像我一样迷失了
What do you think he is as lost as I was?

1541
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:26,470
我知道什么是真的 茉儿
I know what's real,Mal.

1542
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:29,750
一点疑惑都没有
No creeping doubts,

1543
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:33,070
一点困扰都没有吗  道姆
not feeling persecuted,Dom?

1544
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:37,950
满世界都有匿名组织和警察追捕你
Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces?

1545
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:41,130
就像盗梦者被防御者追杀一样
Or whether the projections persecute the dreamer?

1546
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:44,140
承认吧
Admit it,

1547
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,830
你早就不再相信所谓的现实了
you don't believe in one reality anymore.

1548
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:52,160
留下吧 留在这里
So choose,choose to be here,

1549
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:53,920
在这陪着我
Choose me.

1550
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:23,580
你知道我为何而来 我想回到孩子身边
You know why I have the deal,have to get back to our children?

1551
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,020
因为你抛弃了他们
Because you left them,

1552
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,880
因为你离开了我们
because you left us.

1553
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:28,940
-你错了  -我没有
- You're wrong! - I'm not wrong.

1554
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,940
你还没搞清楚
You're confused.

1555
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:34,360
我们的孩子在这里
Our children are here.

1556
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:38,140
你也想再见见他们吧
And you'd like to see their faces again,wouldn't you?

1557
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:41,710
是 不过我会回到现实的世界去见他们
Yes. But I want to see them up above,Mal.

1558
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:56,860
现实世界
Up above?

1559
02:01:57,870 --> 02:01:59,740
你别犯傻了
Listen to yourself.

1560
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:02,100
孩子们在这里呢
These are our children.

1561
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:03,190
自己看
Watch.

1562
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:05,640
詹姆斯  菲利帕
James! Phillipa!

1563
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:07,330
别这样 茉儿 求你了
Don't do this,Mal. Please.

1564
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:08,990
他们都不是真的
Those aren't my children.

1565
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:11,090
你一直都这么说 但你确定吗
You keep telling yourself that,but you don't believe it.

1566
02:02:11,110 --> 02:02:13,300
-是 我确信  -万一你错了呢
- No,I know it! - What if you're wrong?

1567
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,570
如果我这里才是真实的呢
What if I'm what's real?

1568
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:19,680
你一直以为自己知道什么是真的
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1569
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,030
那你告诉我
But what do you believe?

1570
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:25,990
什么感觉是真的
What do you feel?

1571
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:28,620
罪恶感
Guilt.

1572
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:32,200
我很愧疚 茉儿
I feel guilt,Mal.

1573
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:34,930
不管我做在什么 
No matter what I do,no...

1574
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,740
无论有多绝望 多困惑 那种罪恶感...
no matter how hopeless I am,no matter how I confused,that guilt...

1575
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:44,000
都与我如影随形 就是这种愧疚提醒什么是真的
is always there,reminding me of the truth.

1576
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,890
什么真相
What truth?

1577
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:51,790
你对真实世界的质疑
That the idea that caused you to question your reality

1578
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:53,770
全是因我而生
came from me.

1579
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:00,380
你把这个想法植入了我的意识了
You planted the idea in my mind?

1580
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,180
她在说什么
What is she talking about?

1581
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,610
我之所以确信植入想法是可能的  是因为...
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I...

1582
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:09,370
我对试过了
I did it to her first.

1583
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:13,420
-我拿我妻子做了实验  -为什么
- I did it to my own wife. - Why?

1584
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:15,650
我们在这里困住了
We were lost in here.

1585
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:21,020
我知道我们必须得逃出去 但她不愿意
I knew we needed to escape,but she wouldn't accept it.

1586
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:29,760
她把内心的秘密锁在了潜意识最深处
She had locked something away,something.... something deep inside.

1587
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:34,770
对于她曾经了解的现实  她选择将其遗忘
The truth that she had once known,but she chose to forget.

1588
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:37,800
她深陷其中 无法自拔
She couldn't break free.

1589
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,170
于是我决定去寻找它
So I decided to search for it,

1590
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:48,830
走进她内心最深处 找到那秘密的角落
going deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.

1591
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,780
我闯了进去
I broke in.

1592
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:53,710
并且植入了一个想法
Then I planted an idea,

1593
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:58,380
一个非常简单却能颠覆一切的想法
a simple little idea that would change everything.

1594
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,670
"她的世界不是真的"
"That "her world wasn't real."

1595
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:21,540
"只有死亡是唯一的解脱"
"the death was the only escape."

1596
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:31,350
你在等一趟火车
You're waiting for a train,

1597
02:04:32,650 --> 02:04:35,850
它会把你带去远方
The train that'll take you far away.

1598
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:40,260
你了然心之所向
You know where you hope this train will take you,

1599
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:43,430
却不知自己火车开向何方
But you can't know for sure.

1600
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:46,810
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

1601
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:48,430
告诉我为什么
Now tell me why!

1602
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:50,530
因为我们会在一起
Because we'll be together!

1603
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:56,500
但我万万想到
But I never knew that...

1604
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,760
那个想法就像癌细胞一样扩散
that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer,

1605
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,870
扩散到她清醒的意识里
that even after she woke up.

1606
02:05:03,970 --> 02:05:07,780
甚至扩散到了你真实的生活里
That even after you came back to reality.

1607
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:13,850
你还是不相信 你活在真实的世界里
That you continue to believe your world wasn't real.

1608
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:17,920
死亡是唯一的解脱
That death was the only escape.

1609
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:20,960
茉儿 不要 老天爷啊……
Mal! No! Jesus...

1610
02:05:20,990 --> 02:05:24,570
-你侵入了我的意识  -我是想救你
- You infected my mind? - I was trying to save you.

1611
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:26,350
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

1612
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,430
但你仍可以补救 继续遵守你的诺言
But you can make amends,you can still keep your promise.

1613
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:34,030
我们还是能在一起
We can still be together,

1614
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:37,620
在这里 这个我们一起创造的世界里
right here,in the world we built together.

1615
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:59,520
柯布 我们必须找到费舍尔
Cobb,we need to get Fischer.

1616
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,330
你们找不到他的
You can't have him.

1617
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:06,970
-如果我留在这 能放了他吗  -你说什么
- If I stay here,would you let them go? - What're you talking about?

1618
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:12,970
费舍尔在门廊上
Fischer's on the porch.

1619
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,660
-看他还是否活着  -柯布 你不能这样
- Go check if he's alive. - Cobb,you can't do this.

1620
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:19,110
快去看看他是不是还活着 快
Go check if he's alive,right now. Do it.

1621
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:37,190
柯布 他在这  时间到了 你该出来了
Cobb,he's here. And it's time. You have to come now!

1622
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,870
帮我把费舍尔 带回去 好吗
Take Fischer with you,alright?

1623
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:41,130
你不能留在这陪她


1624
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:48,230
我不会 但斋藤已经死了 他肯定在这了
I'm not. Saito's dead by now,that means he's down here somewhere.

1625
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:50,920
我必须找到他
It means I have to find him.

1626
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:55,140
我不会在这陪她的  因为她不是真的
I can't stay with her anymore,because she doesn't exist.

1627
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:58,150
对你来说 只有我才是真的
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.

1628
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:02,350
是啊 我也想...
No. I wish...

1629
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:07,450
如果是真的该有多好 但是...
I wish more than anything,but...

1630
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:10,660
我想像不出你所有的复杂情绪
I can't imagine you with all your complexity,

1631
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:14,240
所有的完美与不完美
all your perfection,all your imperfection.

1632
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:15,670
你还好吗
You alright?

1633
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,820
看看你自己
Look at you,

1634
02:08:18,950 --> 02:08:20,600
你只是个幻影
you're just a shade.

1635
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,820
我真正妻子的影子
You're just the shade of my real wife.

1636
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:27,230
我已经竭尽全力来想象了 可是
You're the best that I could do,but...

1637
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:30,380
对不起 你远远比不上真实的她
I'm sorry,you are just not good enough.

1638
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:32,680
这样感觉够真实了吧
Doesn't this feel real?

1639
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:37,720
-你干什么  -见机行事
- What're you doing? - Improvise.

1640
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,000
不 不 等等
No,no! No!

1641
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,420
快进去 快 快 快
Get in there,now. Go! Go,go,go!

1642
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,170
费舍尔

1643
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:38,070

02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:43,210
-我很失...失... -我明白  爸爸

1645
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:55,260
我没变的像你一样 你很失望
I know you were disappointed,I couldn't be you.

1646
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:59,070
不 不 不
No,no,no.

1647
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:01,340
我很失望是因为...
I was disappointed...

1648
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:04,920
你想成为另一个我
That you tried.

1649
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:29,830
什么
What?

1650
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,990
（528 491）

1651
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:48,890
开启

1652
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:51,230
遗嘱

1653
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:54,390
该坠落了 艾莲涅 快
That's the kick,Ariadne! You have to go now!

1654
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:10,680
别迷失了自己 找到斋藤 把他带回来
Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!

1655
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,100
我会的
I will!

1656
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,410
记得你向我求婚时说的话吗
Do you remember when you asked me to marry you?

1657
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:56,320
记得
Yes.

1658
02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:00,300
你说你梦到我们一起慢慢变老
You said you dreamt that we grow old together.

1659
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:04,160
是的 我们的确
But we did.

1660
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:08,210
一起慢慢变老 你不记得了吗
We did,you don't remember?

1661
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:15,810
我想你想到无法呼吸 
I miss you more than I can bear,but...

1662
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:20,950
我们厮守了一生
we had our time together.

1663
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:24,100
现在我必须放手了
I have to let you go.

1664
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,910
放手让你安息
I have to let you go.

1665
02:14:18,490 --> 02:14:20,310
我很抱歉 费舍尔
I'm sorry,Robert.

1666
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:51,020
爸爸是想通过遗嘱告诉我 要我走自己的路
You know,the will means that dad wanted me to be my own man.

1667
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:54,260
而不是为他而活
Not just to live for him.

1668
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:58,330
我自己也是这么想的 彼得叔叔
That's what I'm gonna do,uncle Peter.

1669
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:10,670
-怎么回事  - 柯布留在那了
- What happened? - Cobb stayed.

1670
02:15:10,690 --> 02:15:13,350
-为了茉儿  -不 为了找到斋藤
- With Mal? - No,to find Saito.

1671
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,310
他回不来了
He'll be lost.

1672
02:15:19,390 --> 02:15:21,220
不 他会回来
No,he'll be alright.

1673
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:40,020
你是来杀我的吗
Have you come to kill me?

1674
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:46,020
我一直在等一个人
I'm waiting for someone,

1675
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:53,870
一个你曾经梦见过的人
someone from a half remembered dream.

柯布
Cobb?

1677

怎么可能
Impossible.

1678
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:04,040
我们年龄差不多的
We were young men together.

1679
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:07,930
而已经年华逝去
I'm an old man.

1680
02:16:09,070 --> 02:16:11,600
在悔恨中度过余生
Filled with regret.

1681
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:17,760
孤零零地等死
Waiting to die alone,huh?

1682

我回来找你了
I've come back for you,

是为了提醒你...
to remind you...

02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:30,090
一些事...
of something...

1685
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:35,580
一些你曾了解的事情
something you once knew.

1686
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:41,090
这个世界不是真的
That this world is not real.

1687
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:50,320
你是想提醒我要履行我们之间的协议
To convince me to honor our arrangement.

1688
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:54,380
是的 放手一搏
To take a leap of faith,yes.
