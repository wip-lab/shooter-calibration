2
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,600
马上就来
I'm on my way.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,710
我知道这是什么
I know what this is.

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,430
这就叫做盗梦
It's called extraction.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,170
你凭什么能做到
How can you do that?

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,180
因为我就是最出色的盗梦者
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,170
我能窥探你的想法 找出你大脑里的所有秘密
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets.

34
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,050
我精通其中窍门
I know the tricks.

48
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,080
斋藤都知道了 他在耍我们
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

49
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,810
别担心 我会搞定 相信我
Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.

50
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,480
情报就在保险箱里
The information is in the safe.

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,950
茉儿 你来这干嘛?
Mal,what are you doing here?

58
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,320
我以为你会想我的
I thought you might be missing me.

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,790
不过我再也不敢相信你了
But I can't trust you anymore.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,890
所以呢?
So what?

62
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,660
一看就像是亚瑟的品味
Looks like Arthur's taste.

64
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,870
请坐吧
Please,have a seat.

65
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,040
告诉我...
Tell me...

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,010
孩子们有没有想我
Do the children miss me?

68
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,320
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

69
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,030
出去透透气
Just getting some fresh air.

70
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,190
你坐那别动  茉儿
Stay where you are,Mal.

71
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,740
天 该死
God,damn it.

72
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,170
转过身来
Turn around.

78
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,980
我想知道是谁雇你们来的
I want to know the name of your employer.

81
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,560
杀了他只会让他醒过来
Killing him would just wake him up.

87
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,760
我知道 梦境已经崩溃
I know. But the dream's collapsing.

91
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,430
拦住他!
Stop him!

92
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,420
没戏了 把他叫醒
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

108
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,330
你有所保留是因为你知道我们是来干什么的  
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.

115
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,790
雇佣我们的公司  是可不允许我们失手的
That corporation that hired us,they won't accept failure.

116
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,190
我们活不过两天
We won't last two days.

117
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,230
柯布?
Cobb?

119
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,660
把你知道的告诉我们! 
Tell us what you know!

121
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,710
我一直很讨厌这里的地毯
I've always hated this carpet.

127
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,940
你果然名不虚传 柯布先生
You have lived up to your reputation,Mr. Cobb.

128
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,410
我现在依然在梦里
I'm still dreaming.

133
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
我们不是在你的梦里
We're not in your dream.

145
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
喂 你好?
Yes,hello?

155
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,580
外婆说你再也不会回来了
Grandma says you're never coming back.

158
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,320
她在摇头
She's shaking her head.

162
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,600
妈妈跟你在一起吗？
Is Mommy with you?

163
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,440
詹姆斯 我跟你说过了
James,we talked about this.

164
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,070
妈妈她已经不在了
Mommy's not here anymore.

166
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,750
好了 孩子们 说再见吧
That's enough,kids. Say bye-bye.

174
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,250
下不为例
Won't happen again.

189
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,530
这不是我的风格
It's not the way I deal with things.

196
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,770
好 我来给你植入一个想法
Okay,here's me planting an idea in your head.

199
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,440
大象
Elephants.

208
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,540
告诉飞行员你们要去哪儿
Tell the crew where you want to go.

209
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,880
嘿 柯布先生
Hey,Mr. Cobb.

210
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:25,220
让你回家意下如何 回到美国 和孩子们团圆  
How would you like to go home,to America,to your children?

211
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,990
这太难 你做不到 没人能做到
You can't fix that. No one can.

216
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,640
我最大的竞争对手是个病入膏肓的老人
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.

217
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,580
他的儿子马上就要接管他的公司
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.

218
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,050
我想要他毁掉他父亲创建的帝国
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.

227
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,270
组建你的团队吧  柯布先生  
Assemble your team,Mr. Cobb.

229
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,860
我知道你有多想回家
I know how much you wanna go home.

232
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,840
只要潜入得足够深
Just have to go deep enough.

233
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,570
你怎么知道
You don't know that.

234
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,740
我以前做过
I've done it before.

240
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,580
你来这里安全吗？
Is it safe for you to be here?

250
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,290
这些都是你教我的
I'm doing what you taught me.

251
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,990
我可没教你去当小偷
I never taught you to be a thief.

252
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
没 你教我如何操纵别人的思想
No,you taught me to navigate people's minds.

256
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,210
道姆 你来这想干嘛？
What are you doing here,Dom?

257
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,710
我找到了回家的办法
I found a way home.

260
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,150
但我要你帮点忙
But I need your help.

263
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,230
让他们自己决定
Let them decide for themselves.

272
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,550
他们不必亲自进入梦境
They don't actually come into the dream.

275
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,390
你自己设计吧
Design it yourself.

276
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,560
茉儿会阻止我的
Mal won't let me.

277
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,900
回到现实中来吧  道姆
Come back to reality,Dom.

280
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,230
正在苦苦等着他们的爸爸回家
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

281
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,980
这个就是他们的现实
That's their reality.

284
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,420
我要不是走投无路  我绝不会来这求你的
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.

285
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,490
我需要个和我一样出色的筑梦师
I need an architect who's as good as I was.

288
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,040
介绍一下 柯布先生
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

289
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,540
幸会
Pleased to meet you.

301
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,600
停
Stop.

302
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,240
再来
Again.

303
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,710
停
Stop.

305
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,230
这才像话
That's more like it.

309
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,520
比如呢？
Such as?

311
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,690
你必须有意识地设计每一个细节
You consciously create each aspect.

312
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,680
但有时候 楼房像在自己设计自己
But sometimes,it feels like it's almost creating itself,

314
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,830
明白 好像我发现了它
Yeah,like I'm discovering it.

323
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,920
你创造一个 梦境
You create the world of the dream.

332
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,250
你是不是从不记得梦的开始？
You never really remember the beginning of a dream,do you?

334
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,650
好像是的
I guess,yeah.

337
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,490
仔细想 艾莲涅 你怎么来这的
Think about it,Ariadne. How did you get here?

338
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,000
你现在到底在哪儿？
Where are you right now?

339
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,470
我们在做梦？
We're dreaming?

340
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,070
你正睡在工作坊中央
You're in the middle of the workshop,sleeping.

341
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,210
这是你学习分享梦境的第一课 冷静点
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

342
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,680
要是在做梦的话 你干嘛要保护...
If it's just a dream,then why are you covering...

345
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,520
做梦的时候 感觉都是真实的
When you're in it,it feels real.

346
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,890
所以军队开发了梦境分享系统
That's why the military developed dream sharing.

347
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,410
士兵可以在里面相互射击
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot,

350
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,160
筑梦师的工作是什么？
How did architects become involved?

352
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,530
干嘛不再给我们五分钟？
Why don't you give us another five minutes?

353
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,800
五分钟？
Five minutes?

357
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,450
现实世界的五分钟 相当于梦境里的一小时
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.

358
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,250
试试看你在五分钟内能做设计出什么来？
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?

360
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,930
其他该有的也都有了
Almost everything else is here too.

363
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,070
记住 你是做梦者 你设计梦境
Remember,you are the dreamer. You build this world.

366
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,140
这也是我们偷取信息的一种办法
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.

370
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,560
重要信息就会自动存入其中
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.

378
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,040
他们为什么都看着我？
Why are they all looking at me?

379
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,100
因为我的潜意识怀疑这不是一个真实的世界
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.

390
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,140
这可是我的潜意识 我自己没法控制
It's my subconscious,I can't control it.

392
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,650
这座桥我见过 它是现实中的 对吗？
I know this bridge. This place is real,isn't it?

393
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,070
是啊 我每天上学都会经过这
Yeah,I cross it everyday to get to the college.

394
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,040
绝对不能根据记忆重建场景
Never recreate places from your memory,

396
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,600
那总会借用熟悉的东西吧？
Well,you gotta draft from stuff you know,right?

397
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
只能借用细节...
Only use details...

403
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,120
这和我无关 懂吗？
this has nothing to do with me,understand?

405
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,670
别碰她 走开
Get off of her. Back off.

407
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,000
别碰她！
Get off of her!

408
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,260
茉儿！
Mal!

409
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,490
把我叫醒！  把我叫醒！ 
Wake me up! Wake me up!

410
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,870
茉儿！ 茉儿！
Mal! Mal!

411
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,000
叫醒我！
Wake me up! 

413
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,700
为什么我醒不过来
Why wouldn't I wake up?

420
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,660
看来你见过柯布夫人了
I see you met Mrs. Cobb.

425
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,980
不行 必须更独特些才行
No,it must be more unique than that.

428
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,130
只有我知道这个特制骰子的重心在哪里
Only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.

433
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,780
柯布的心里问题很严重 而且他还想把那些问题藏起来
Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.

434
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,720
我绝对不会允许这样的人进入我的梦境
I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.

435
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,960
她会回来的
She'll be back.

436
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,750
我还从没见过有人学得这么快
I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.

437
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,450
现实已经满足不了她了
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.

443
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
必须冒这个险 
It's a necessary risk.

444
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,570
神偷多了去了
There's plenty of good thieves.

456
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,170
只是难吗？
Just difficult?

457
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,800
亚瑟总说这是不可能的
Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

469
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,370
这是相当精妙的技艺
That's a very subtle art.

470
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,140
那么 说下你要植入的想法是什么？
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

477
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,950
你必须从一个最根本的问题入手
All you have to do is to start with the absolute basic.

482
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,050
他的催眠剂配方独一无二
He formulates his own versions of the compounds.

488
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,920
不记得了 看他开不开枪
I don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.

497
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,010
那边！
There!

498
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,080
没事
Okey.

500
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,980
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

501
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,700
一杯咖啡
One cafe.

507
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,410
柯布说了你会回来
Cobb said you'd be back.

508
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,440
我也不想 可...
I tried not to come. But...

515
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,060
什么窍门？
What kind of tricks?

516
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,650
在梦里 你可以把建筑设计成不可能的图形
In a dream,you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.

519
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,100
看见没？
See?

531
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,360
等着瞧 他们会翻脸不认人的
You wait,they'll turn ugly.

532
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,300
没人喜欢别人在自己的大脑里乱来的
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.

533
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,800
柯布已经不能再筑梦了吗？
Cobb can't build anymore,can he?

535
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,470
他说他不熟悉设计会更安全
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.

536
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,470
为什么？  
Why?

537
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,260
他不愿意说  我想是因为茉儿吧
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.

540
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,640
她已经去世了
she's dead.

541
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,830
你看到的只是他潜意识里的茉儿
What you just see in there is just his projection of her.

551
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,000
这种多层梦境太不稳定了
That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.

555
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,520
六个
Six.

558
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,150
这种工作带游客 可不行啊
There's no room for tourists on a job like this,

559
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,170
斋藤先生
Mr. Saito.

566
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,300
他们每天来这分享梦境
They come here everyday to share the dream.

567
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,160
看见没？ 非常稳定
You see? Very stable.

570
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,010
每人每天四十个小时
About 40 hours,each and every day.

571
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,630
他们为什么这么做？
Why do they do it?

572
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,370
你来说吧 柯布先生
Tell him,Mr. Cobb.

575
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,990
你还做梦吗? 柯布先生  
Do you still dream,Mr. Cobb?

577
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,890
不 他们来这是为了醒过来
No,they come to be woken up.

582
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,040
你没事吧 柯布先生?  
Are you all right,Mr. Cobb?

583
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,640
放心 我没事
yeah. I'm just fine.

586
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,220
你和这位费舍尔先生有什么过节?
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

587
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,860
这不用你管
That's not your concern.

588
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,820
斋藤先生 这...
Mr. Saito,this...

589
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,540
这可不是一般意义上的商业间谍活动
this isn't your typical corporate espionage.

590
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,780
你让我植入一个想法 我希望你能理解...
You asked me for inception,I do hope you understand that...

594
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,680
甚至可能会彻底改变他的人生
it may come to change everything about him.

595
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,940
要不是我们公司 他们早就垄断全球的能源市场了
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.

596
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,240
我们快撑不住了
We can no longer compete.

597
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,730
很快他们将控制半个世界的能源供给
Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world.

598
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,060
然后他们将成为新兴的强权帝国
In effect,they become a new superpower.

604
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,270
有传言说他们之间的关系有些纠结
Rumor is their relationship is quite complicated.

606
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,480
能帮我接近这个人吗?
Can you get me access to this man here?

607
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,390
布朗宁
Browning?

608
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,740
老费舍尔的左膀右臂
Fischer senior's right-hand man,

610
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,890
应该不难 只要你有适当的引荐信
It should be possible,if you can get the right references.

620
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,780
他怎么样了?
How is he?

621
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,150
我也不想打扰他 但...
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily,but...

630
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:09,980
罗伯特 我们恐怕得谈谈你的继承权了
Robert,we need to talk about the power of attorney.

633
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,630
秃鹰已经在盘旋了
The vultures are circling.

636
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,180
我花了不少时间 来观察了布朗宁
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning,

646
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,420
伊姆斯 我很佩服
Eames,I am impressed.

649
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,030
你刚刚是一个人进入梦境吗?
Were you going under on your own?

651
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,920
没想到这里还有别人 所以...
I didn't realize anyone was here. So...

653
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,450
过来 给我看看
Here,let me take a look.

662
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,180
迷宫设计得怎么样了?
How are the mazes coming along?

670
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,090
为什么要这样?
Why's that so important?

671
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,640
以防我们中有人把自己的防御者也带进去
In case one of us brings in our projections,

672
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,900
我们不能让他们知道迷宫的细节
we don't want them knowing the details of the maze.

677
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,100
她就会破坏整个行动
She'd sabotage the whole operation.

678
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,680
柯布 其他人知道吗？  
Cobb,did the others know?

679
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,460
不 不知道
No,they don't.

680
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,690
万一情况变糟了 你应该告诉大家
You gotta warn them if this is getting worse.

682
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,290
我只想要回家
I need to get home.

683
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,820
这是我现在唯一关心的事情
That's all I care about right now.

684
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,110
你为什么回不了家？
Why can't you go home?

695
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,640
你怎么把一个商业策略转变成情感元素？
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?

704
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,570
我们每个人都渴望和谐、精神上的宣泄
We all yearn for reconciliation,a catharsis.

715
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,430
我们只能见机行事
we're gonna have to work with what we find.

716
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,430
在第一层梦境  我们从他和父亲的紧张关系入手
On the top level,we open up his relationship with his father,

732
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,340
大脑的运转速度会整整提高二十倍
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.

733
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,900
进入梦中梦 效果会叠加
When you enter a dream within that dream,the effect is compounded.

734
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,240
三层梦境 也就是十小时乘以二十...
Three dreams,that's ten hour times twenty...

735
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,560
不好意思
I'm sorry

736
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,910
我数学一向不好
math's never my strong subject.

740
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,350
谁愿意困在梦里长达十年？
Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?

756
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,240
我们可以用音乐倒计时来同步所有的坠落
We can use a musical countdown to synchronize different kicks.

758
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,690
他没预约外科手术、牙医 什么都没有
He hasn't any surgery schedule,no dental,nothing.

759
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,510
他不是该动个膝盖手术吗？
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?

761
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,800
我们至少需要十小时
We need at least ten hours.

771
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,320
但你得包下头等舱
But you'd have to buyout the entire cabin,

773
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,640
我把那家航空公司买下来了
I bought the airline.

774
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,170
这样比较省事
It seemed neater.

775
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,270
看来我们有十个小时了
It looks like we have our ten hours.

777
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,580
你知道怎么找到我
You know how to find me.

778
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,170
你知道你该怎么做
You know what you have to do.

782
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,350
你来这干嘛 
You shouldn't be in here.

785
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,020
这和你一点关系都没有
it has nothing to do with you.

788
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,280
这是我自己的梦
These are my dreams.

793
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,800
这些不仅仅是梦 这些是记忆
These aren't just dreams. These are memories.

795
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,970
你想尽办法让她活着 你放不下她
You're trying to keep her alive.you can't let her go.

796
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,060
你不懂
You don't understand.

797
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,510
这些都是让我追悔不已的瞬间
These are moments I regret,

803
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,780
那是我儿子詹姆斯
It's my son,James.

804
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,440
他最爱挖土 好像在挖虫子
He's digging for something,maybe a worm.

805
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,460
那是菲利帕
That's Philippa.

815
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,160
不管我做什么都无法改变那一刻
Whatever I do I can't change this moment.

816
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:09,470
就在我想喊他们时 他们跑开了
When I'm about to call out to them,they run away.

817
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:15,100
我要想再见到他们 就一定得回家
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,I've gotta get back home,

824
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,380
来猜个谜语吧
I'll tell you a riddle.

825
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:40,260
你在等一趟火车 它会把你带去远方
You're waiting for a train,a train that will take you far away.

828
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,960
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

831
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,850
道姆 你怎么能把她带过来？
How could you bring her here,Dom?

832
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,070
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

833
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,440
这是我们庆祝结婚纪念日的套房
This is a hotel suite where we spent our anniversary.

834
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,650
这里发生过什么？
What happened here?

838
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,640
我会回来找你 我保证
I'll come back for you,I promise.

839
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,990
你觉得建一座记忆监狱 就能关住她吗？
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?

841
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,660
是时候了 老费舍尔刚在悉尼去世
It's time.Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

843
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,630
罗伯特必须在周二前去护送遗体
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday.

849
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,710
但你得把我刚才看见的都告诉亚瑟
but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.

850
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,720
在飞机上加个位子
Get us another seat on the plane.

856
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
谢谢
Thank you.

859

一样 谢谢
Same,please.

860
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,120
那个...谢谢
Umm... thank you.

866
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:11,010
来 敬你父亲 愿他安息
Hey,to your father. May he rest in peace.

878
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,460
上来
Come on.

879
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,040
这里有五百美元
There's five hundred dollars in there,

894
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,310
我们被一列火车截住了
We were blocked by a freight train.

899
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:51,480
那些人都不是普通的防御者
Those were not normal projections.

908
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,410
你应该把他的底细调查清楚!
You were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly!

909
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,290
对这种袭击 我们完全没有防备!
We are not prepared for this type of fire!

914
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,150
他太痛苦了 我要把他叫醒
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

915
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,680
不行 你唤不醒他的
No,it won't wake him up.

920
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:38,000
好吧 那死了会怎样?
Right. so what happens when we die?

932
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,430
几十年 也许是永远 我怎么知道
Decades,it could be infinite,I don't know.

933
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,570
问他吧 他去过
Ask him. he's the one who's been there.

936
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,820
我们现在 困在费舍尔的潜意识里
now we are trapped in Fischer's mind

943
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,940
不应该有危险的
There wasn't meant to be any risk.

946
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,200
这是深入三层梦境的唯一方式
This is the only way to go three layers deep.

948
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,300
我相信他
I trusted him.

951
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,340
而且他说他以前干过
Besides,he said he had done it before.

954
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,900
我只是竭尽所能回到我的孩子身边
I did what I had to do to get back to my children.

955
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,790
所以你就把我们领向一条不归路
So you led us into a war zone with no way out?

957
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,230
大家继续按计划行事 速战速决
We continue on with the job,and we do this as fast as possible,

959
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,310
拉倒吧 走得越深我们就越危险
Forget it. If we go any deeper,we just raise the stakes.

963
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,460
十小时的航线 在这一层就是一个礼拜
The ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.

971
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,900
闭嘴 没那么简单
Shut up! It won't be.

972
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,460
你老爸办公室的书橱下 有个保险箱
In your father's office,below the bookshelves,is his personal safe.

974
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:54,520
那不代表你不知道密码 快告诉我们
It doesn't mean you don't know the combination. Tell us what it is.

975
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,740
我不知道
I don't know.

987
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,260
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

992
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,540
给你一小时 谈吧
You have one hour. Start talking.

993
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,560
你还好吧?
Are you okey?

994
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,430
这帮混蛋关了我整整两天
Those bastards've had me for two days.

995
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:20,810
他们派人潜入了你父亲的办公室
They have someone with access to your father's office.

997
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,910
他们以为我知道密码 可我不知道
They thought I'd know the combination,but I don't know it.

1000
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,270
你是唯一知道密码的人
you are the only one to be able to open it.

1003
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,030
只是你不知道那就是密码
maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.

1009
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,480
我妈去世后 你知道他跟我说什么吗?
After my mother died,you know what he told me?

1011
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,880
他不善表达情感
he was bad with emotions.

1014
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,760
等我们到下面几层 疼痛感就会减弱
When we get down to the lower levels,the pain will be less intense.

1016
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,530
醒来后 会完全丧失意识
When he wakes up,his mind is completely gone.

1017
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,780
柯布 我仍会履行我们的协议
Cobb,I'll still honor the arrangement.

1019
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:38,740
你醒来后 根本不会记得我们曾有过协议
When you wake up,you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.

1024
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:57,020
不 我会回来 和你们一起重回年轻
No,I'll come back. and we'll be young men,together again.

1025
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,960
深呼吸
Breathe.

1029
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:13,030
他们会把我们塞进货车 把车丢进河里喂鱼
They're gonna whack us in that van and then drive it into the river.

1030
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:16,150
好吧 那保险箱里到底有什么？
Alright,what is it in the safe?

1031
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,400
是留给你的东西
Something for you.

1032
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,970
你父亲总说 那是他留给你最珍贵的礼物
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.

1035
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,540
如果你愿意 完全可以推翻前一份
This would supersede the other,if you want it to.

1040
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:50,110
他很爱你 罗伯特 以他独特的方式
He loved you,Robert,in his own way.

1042
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:58,850
他临终前 把我叫到他床边
At the end,he called me to his deathbed.

1048
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,310
你什么时候进入过迷失域？
When were you in limbo?

1049
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,430
虽然你成功说服了大家继续执行任务
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job,

1058
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:04,520
我们在研究在梦里做梦的可能性
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.

1066
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,940
我们为自己创造了一个世界
We created and built a world for ourselves.

1067
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,520
我们建了很多年
We did that for years.

1068
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,980
我们建起了只属于我们自己的世界
We built our own world.

1070
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:55,220
天呐 你们怎么能受得了？
Jeez. How could you stand it?

1072
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,430
但问题是这些都不是真的
The problem was none of them was real.

1079
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,390
你们醒来后发生了什么？
What happened when you woke up?

1082
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,010
我知道她有点不对劲
I knew something was wrong with her.

1083
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,040
只是她自己不愿承认
she just wouldn't admit it.

1084
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:48,160
她最终告诉了我真相
Eventually,she told me the truth.

1089
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:13,540
想要回去 我们俩都必须自杀
In order to get back home,we had to kill ourselves.

1090
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,930
那你们的孩子呢？
What about your children?

1094
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,650
你以为我看不出区别吗？
Don't you think I can't tell the difference?

1095
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,770
如果我在做梦 为什么我会控制不了它？
If this is my dream,why can't I control this?

1096
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,730
因为你不知道自己在做梦
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

1097
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,570
她是如此坚决 不管我怎么解释
She was certain there was nothing I can do,

1100
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,690
她太爱我了 所以...
She loved me too much,so...

1101
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:51,690
在我们结婚纪念日那天 她想了一个办法
She came up with the plan on our anniversary.

1105
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,280
不
No.

1113
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,540
我们谈得够多了
we've talked enough.

1114
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,490
茉儿
Mal.

1116
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,650
好
Okey.

1119
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,480
我不能跳 你知道我不会跳的
I can't. you know I can't do that.

1120
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,320
为孩子们想想
Take a second to think about our children.

1121
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:17,850
想想詹姆斯 想想菲利帕
Think about James,think about Phillipa

1132
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,690
你在等一趟火车
you're waiting for a train,

1142
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:20,280
她找了三个心理医生 证明她心智正常
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists,

1147
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,700
好吧 我们走
Alright,let's go.

1148
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:44,140
我丢下了我的孩子
I left my children behind,

1149
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,180
自那以后我就一直想办法回去
And I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.

1150
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,290
你的罪恶感塑造了她 她才如此强大
Your guilt defines her,it's what powers her.

1155
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,870
但你不必孤身奋战  
But you don't have to do that alone.

1162
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:26,170
我不知道什么密码 至少在清醒时是不知道的
I don't know any combination,not consciously anyway.

1176
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,900
他们父子间的关系比我们想象的还糟
That boy's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined.

1184
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,040
该死！
Damn it!

1246
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,220
其实这不是真的 对吧？
That's not true at all,is it?

1256
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,160
你是说梦境吗？
Are you talking about dreams?

1258
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,660
我是来这保护你的
I'm here to protect you.

1259
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,900
费舍尔先生 我之所以过来保护你
Mr.Fischer,I'm here to protect you

1263
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,870
你感觉到了吗？
You feel that?

1264
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,000
出什么事了？
What's happening?

1269
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,000
我们还是走吧
We should probably get out of here.

1270
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,200
你感觉到了吗？
Do you feel that?

1272
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,680
注意天气的反常和重力的变向
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather,the shift of the gravity.

1273
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:45,110
这一切都不是真的 你在做梦
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1278
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,990
你必须意识到你是在梦里 我是来保护你的
Accept the fact that you're in the dream,and I'm here to protect you.

1279
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,580
继续想想
Go on.

1281
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,980
我是你潜意识里的防御者
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1290
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:08,210
想要我救你 你得保持冷静
If you want my help,you have to remain calm.

1291
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:12,030
费舍尔先生 你得和我合作才行
I need you to work with me,Mr. Fischer.

1292
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,510
如果这是梦 只要自杀就能醒 对吗？
If this is a dream,I should just kill myself to wake up. Right?

1293
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,670
费舍尔先生 换做我就不会这么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you,mr. fischer.

1299
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,190
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1312
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,000
这就像你醒来回想自己的梦一样难
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.

1320
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:09,230
他们想从你的潜意识里偷取一串数字
They were trying to extract the number from your subconscious.

1350
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,720
跟着他 看看他会做什么
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1361
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,930
我不能让你毁掉它
I can't let you destroy it.

1376
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:34,310
我要你以其人之道还治其人之身
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.

1379
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,030
好吧
All right.

1380
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,310
他睡过去了
He's out.

1391
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,990
你没事吧？
Are you good?

1398
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,590
伊姆斯 这是你的梦境
Eames,this is your dream.

1399
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,800
我要你引开医院里的警卫 明白吗？
I need you to draw the security away from the complex. Do you understand?

1406
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,940
好的 那你呢？
Alright. What about you?

1415
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,350
行动！
Move!

1416
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,620
快上！
Go!

1417
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,890
但愿你们准备好了
Hope you're ready.

1418
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:06,440
不不 这太早了
No,it's too soon.

1419
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:13,490
柯布 听到了吗
Cobb,do you hear that?

1429
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,370
在那！
There!

1430
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:59,790
我是照迷宫设计的
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1432
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,170
伊姆斯
Eames.

1436
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:36,040
他加了一条穿过迷宫的通风系统
He added an airduct system that can cut through the maze.

1437
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,770
好极了 告诉他们
Good,explain it to them.

1445
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,150
如需拨打电话 请挂机后重试
If you want to make a call,please hang up and try again.

1447
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,870
亚瑟还有几分钟 我们还有二十多分钟
Arthur has a couple of minutes,we have about twenty.

1448
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:46,360
你还行吗？
Are you okey?

1455
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,460
保险库有窗户吗？
Does the strong room have windows?

1461
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:32,400
好了 我们到了
Okey. We are here.

1491
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,190
值得一试
That's worth a shot.

1498
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,040
我是说 茉儿也会在下面
I mean,Mal's gonna be down there.

1499
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:42,490
我知道去哪找她 费舍尔肯定在她手里
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.

1501
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,750
她想让我去下面找她
She wants me to come after her,

1510
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:28,860
这种工作 带游客可不行
No room for tourists on this job.

1512
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:07,140
这些都你们造的？ 太不可思议了
You built all this? This is incredible.

1513
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,820
我们造了许多年
We built it for years.

1515
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,850
跟我来
This way.

1517
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:04,250
这是我们住的街区
This is our neighborhood,

1519
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:09,310
那是我们的第一间公寓
That was our first apartment.

1520
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:13,130
后来搬到那面去了 茉儿怀孕后  
And we moved to that building right there,after Mal became pregnant,

1526
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,810
来吧
Come on.

1529
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:18,000
你准备怎么把费舍尔带回去？
How would you bring Fischer back?

1541
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:26,470
我知道什么是真的 茉儿
I know what's real,Mal.

1546
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:44,140
承认吧
Admit it,

1547
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,830
你早就不再相信所谓的现实了
you don't believe in one reality anymore.

1551
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,020
因为你抛弃了他们
Because you left them,

1552
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,880
因为你离开了我们
because you left us.

1554
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,940
你没搞清楚
You're confused.

1555
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:34,360
我们的孩子在这里
Our children are here.

1556
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:38,140
你也想再见见他们吧？
And you'd like to see their faces again,wouldn't you?

1563
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:07,330
别这样 茉儿 求你了
Don't do this,Mal. Please.

1572
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:32,200
我很愧疚 茉儿
I feel guilt,Mal.

1576
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,890
什么真相？
What truth?

1580
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,180
她在说什么？
What is she talking about?

1589
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,170
于是我决定去寻找它
So I decided to search for it,

1591
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,780
我闯了进去
I broke in.

1596
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:31,350
你在等一趟火车
You're waiting for a train,

1600
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:46,810
但这并不重要
But it doesn't matter.

1602
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:50,530
因为我们会在一起！
Because we'll be together!

1608
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:17,920
死亡是唯一的解脱
That death was the only escape.

1611
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:26,350
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

1612
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,430
但你仍可以补救 继续遵守你的诺言
But you can make amends,you can still keep your promise.

1613
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:34,030
我们还是能在一起
We can still be together,

1615
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:59,520
柯布 我们必须找到费舍尔
Cobb,we need to get Fischer.

1616
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,330
你们找不到他的
You can't have him.

1618
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:12,970
费舍尔在门廊上
Fischer's on the porch.

1620
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:19,110
快去看看他是不是还活着 快
Go check if he's alive,right now. Do it.

1621
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:37,190
柯布 他在这  时间到了 你该出来了！
Cobb,he's here. And it's time. You have to come now!

1622
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,870
帮我把费舍尔 带回去 好吗？
Take Fischer with you,alright?

1633
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,820
看看你自己
Look at you,

1634
02:08:18,950 --> 02:08:20,600
你只是个幻影
you're just a shade.

1635
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,820
你是我真正妻子的影子
You're just the shade of my real wife.

1638
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:32,680
这样感觉够真实了吧？
Doesn't this feel real?

02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:00,300
你说你梦到我们一起慢慢变老
You said you dreamt that we grow old together.

1662
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:20,950
我们厮守了一生
we had our time together.

1673
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:40,020
你是来杀我的吗？
Have you come to kill me?

1674
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:46,020
我一直在等一个人
I'm waiting for someone,

1676
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,400
柯布？
Cobb?

1677
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:00,910
怎么可能
Impossible.

1682
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:22,610
我回来找你了
I've come back for you,

1686
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:41,090
这个世界不是真的
That this world is not real.

1691
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:12,850
跟我回去吧
Come back with me.

1693
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,220
先生 热毛巾要吗？
Hot towel,sir?

1694
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:32,190
大概二十分钟后 我们会抵达达洛杉矶
We will be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes.

1695
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:34,210
入境登记表要吗？
Do you need immigration forms?

1696
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1699
02:18:55,550 --> 02:18:57,070
欢迎回家 柯布先生
Welcome home,Mr. Cobb.

1700
02:18:57,670 --> 02:18:58,940
谢谢你

1701
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:44,450
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1702
02:19:44,830 --> 02:19:46,380
