你的小手多娇嫩啊 跟刚出生的小牛差不多

哦  拜托  我最近都很少玩了
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.

13
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:32,879
你个可怜的小家伙
Oh, you poor thing.

14
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,914
有个在现实世界中跟你亲热的女友
Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you

15
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,750
占用你玩游戏的时间了吗?
getting in the way of your board games?

16
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:40,770
是有点
Little bit, yeah.

17
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:45,558
太棒了!  我一直都很想玩"龙与地下城"的!

19
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,895
我应该事先跟你说清楚的
I should've mentioned this earlier.

20
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:50,096

22
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:57,637
有些时候  我们男人需要挣脱
From time to time, we men need to break free

23
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,907
文明的束缚  去拥抱
from the shackles of civility and get in touch

24
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,277
我们原始的动物本性
with our primal animalistic selves.

25
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,563
通过掷骰子和跟假扮
By rolling dice and playing make-believe

26
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:08,047
小人偶做游戏?
with little figurines?

27
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,416
嗯  就像一群野人一样
Yeah, like a bunch of savages.

28
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,503
周六晚上?
Saturday night?

29
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,038
可是我这周每天晚上都在加班
But I've been working late all week.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,205
说好周六晚上是我们的二人时光呀

00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,507
但我必须得去
But I have to go.

32
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:18,824
我们是一个团队
We play as a group.

33
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,844
如果我没去  他们会怪你的
If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you.

34
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,264
他们会说"都是Bernadette的错"
They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined everything.

35
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,049
"她最讨厌了"
She's the worst."

36
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:28,834
所以  你看吧?
So, you see?

37
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:32,138
为了我们婚姻美满
I have to play dungeons and dragons...

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,307
我必须去玩"龙与地下城"
for the marriage.

39
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:37,176
你个傻子
You're an idiot.

40
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,212
我是你的傻子
I'm your idiot.

41
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,415
一辈子都是
Forever.

42
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:46,202
虽然我们说好要一起去
So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat

43
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,688
银湖吃饭  然后去格里芬公园看圣诞灯
In Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights

44
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,457
但Leonard问我们要不要去
In Griffith Park, but Leonard's talking about

45
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,793
他家玩"龙与地下城"诶!
A big d and d game at his place.

46
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,496
周六晚的计划疯狂直线上升成传奇了!

47
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,830

Sheldon  你得先打开

00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,323
我给你准备的圣诞小礼物 再来开始游戏
You need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.

50
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,141
圣诞礼物?
A Christmas gift?

51
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:36,494
你知道我不喜欢圣诞节啊
You know I don't enjoy Christmas.

52
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,829
圣诞节招你惹你了?
What's wrong with Christmas?

53
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,064
唉  从哪里说起好呢?
Oh, where to begin?

54
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,316
长在屋子里的树
Trees indoors.

55
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,970
过分地使用"tis"和"twas"
Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas."

56
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:48,506
还有单只袜子这种古怪的传统
And the absurd custom of one stocking.

57
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,542
人人都知道袜子应该是一双一双的好么!
Everyone knows socks belong in pas.

58
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:53,010
谁穿一只袜子呀?
Who uses one sock?

59
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,479
一条腿的海盗?
Pirate with a peg leg?

60
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:58,065
噢~~~是哈~  多谢
Actually that helps, thank you.

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,217

手写文字

66

传播系统

67
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:12,029
排在"石碑文字"和"空中文字"之后
After stone tablets and skywriting.

68
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,065
"你们已被召唤 即将踏上

69
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,334
"一场激动人心的"龙与地下城"的旅程

73
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,842
我喜欢这种游戏设定
I like where this is heading.

74
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,126
"你的任务

75
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:29,263

77
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:34,084
——圣诞老人"
Santa Claus"

78
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,270
不  不  不
No, no, no!

79
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,938
事实应该是"哦  哦  哦"
It's actually, "ho, ho, ho,"

80
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,857
不过你能明白滴~
But you'll get the hang of it.

81
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:41,942
我觉得这样应该会很有趣
Thought it'd be fun to make

82
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,110
完成一个带有节日色彩的任务
A quest with a holiday theme.

83
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,278
有趣?
Fun?

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,397
把"龙与地下城"与圣诞节混合起来
Mixing dungeons and dragons with Christmas is

85
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,649
就像把葡萄果冻三明治这种
Like making a sandwich of grape jelly,

86
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:49,950
世界上最好吃的果冻三明治

87
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:53,571
和石油果冻这种世界上最难吃的果冻 混在一起

"硝烟弥漫的圣诞村

91
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,129
"显然  一场恶战刚刚结束"
"Clearly, a great battle has taken place."

92
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:03,664
我一见到怪兽
Oh, man, the first monster I see,

93
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,000
就要冲上前去偷袭  挥起魔杖
I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand,

94
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,620
给他一屁股我的厉害
And shoot my magic all over his ass.

95
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:14,925
你说话时到底过不过脑子呀?
Do you hear yourself when you say these things?

96
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:16,860
好的
Okay,

97
00:04:16,862 --> 00:04:18,395
这里有怪兽走过的痕迹
There are ogre tracks and a trail

98
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:20,064
路上还有散落的糖果
Of broken candy canes in the snow.

99
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,098
Sheldon  你准备怎么做?
Sheldon, what do you do?

100
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,984
对你这种逼着我在游戏中过圣诞节的行为
I signal my contempt for your cruel plan

101
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,653
我要表示深深的不爽
To shove Christmas joy down my throat

102
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:29,806
就通过这个"这家伙有完没完了"的手势
By making a gesture that says, "get a load of this guy."

103
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:32,276
好吧  Howard  你要怎么做?
Fine. Howard, what do you do?

104
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:36,530
我跟着怪兽的脚印  仔细寻找路上有没有
I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors

105
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,499
神秘门
Along the way.

106
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,368
你发现了一个神秘门  它通向一个漆黑的走廊
And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.

107
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,537
走廊中有一个魔力转轮
Spell casters in the back,

108
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:44,788
和一些武士...
Warriors in the front...

109
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,257
不管了  爱怎样怎样  我要进去了
No, screw that noise, I'm going in.

110
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,826
坚持住  圣诞老人  我来了
Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you!

111
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:53,847
好的  你冲进了一个放满了武器的房间
Okay, you run into a room full of weapons,

112
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,449
踩到了一跟电线...
Hit a trip wire...

113
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,386
一声炮响! 你已被炸开了花
...a cannon blows your face off,

114
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,770
你挂了  出局
you die, you're o say these thin

115
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,190
什么  大炮?
But... a canon?

116
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,175
我就这么挂了?
Am I really out of the game?


117
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,945
你真幸运
Lucky.

118
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,196
继续 前进
Okay, come on, moving on.

119
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:12,316
等一下 有人有骷髅棒吗?(游戏中可使尸体复活)
Wait, doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection?

120
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:16,186
如果你们谁有的话  我非常滴想要一棒啊
Because if you've got one, I need it bad.

121
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,524
带着你的棒子 给我一棒吧!
Get in here with your rod and give it to me.

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,227
你说话之前真的得
Okay, you need to say these things

123
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,312
先过过你的大脑
In your head before you say them out loud.

Out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.

137
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,961
我知道她们这是想说明一个观点的
I know they're making a rhetorical point,

138
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,079
但到底是想说啥呢?
I just don't know what it is.

00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,331
在厕所单间里好好享受一下
Into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall

153
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,917
给我们的男人来个教训?
Into a temple of the senses?

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,386
不行  不行
No! no!

155
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,505
天啊  现在谁才是"永远的63岁"
Geez, who's forever 63 now?

156
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:02,459
能给我们再来瓶香槟么
Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table?

157
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,460
别担心
Don't worry.

158
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,961
我请客
It's my treat.

159
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,230
-谢谢  -哇塞!
-Thanks.  -Wow!

160
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:07,765
你应该多来参加女生之夜的聚会
You should come to girls' night more often.

161
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,349
不仅仅是因为如果你不在的话
And not just because if you weren't here,

162
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,635
香槟就变成了一听Pabst啤酒
This would be a can of Pabst.

163
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:13,320
这是我的荣幸  没有什么比
My pleasure; nothing makes me happier

164
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:14,988
宠爱一个女人让我更快乐的事情了
than the chance to spoil a lady.

165
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,356
你只要问我的狗就知道了
Just ask my dog.

166
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,642
兽医说如果我再给她吃鹅肝的话
My vet says if I give her any more foie gras,

167
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,661
她就要痛风而死了
She's going to die of gout.

168
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,864
对了  今晚我们帮Raj认识个女生吧
Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.

169
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,316
-不  不  不用了 我很好  -等等 我们是在说
-No, no, no, I'm fine.  -Okay, wait, are we talking

170
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,655
一夜情呢还是
One-night stand or do we want

171
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,086
比较认真的交往呢?
to get him into a relationship?

172
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,288
让我们帮他滚床单吧!
Let's get him laid!

173
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,042
快停啦  你们这是在破坏女生之夜啊
Stop it. You're ruining girls' night.

174
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,961
Raj  你是个好男人
Raj, you're a great guy,

175
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,347
你又在一个有很多单身女生的酒吧里  让我们帮你吧
You're in a bar full of single women; let us help you.

176
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,682
是啊  你很有魅力的
Yeah, you're a real catch.

177
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,267
我知道你很害羞  但是这并不意味着你不该
I know you're shy, but that doesn't mean

178
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,052
和一个很棒的姑娘一起共度人生啊
You shouldn't have someone wonderful in your life.

179
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,386
你真好
That's sweet of you.

180
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,671
那你们能帮我什么呢
But what can you do to help?

181
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,106
我们四处打量一下
We'll nose around,

182
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:51,725
看能不能找到一个好女孩  然后把你介绍给她
See if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.

183
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,009
好的
Okay.

184
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:54,394
好的  有几点要注意的
Well, a couple of things.

185
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,363
别说我家很有钱
Don't tell them I come from money.

186
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,949
我想要她们爱的是我这个人
I want them to love me for me.

187
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,686
她还得非常非常性感迷人
They must be insanely hot.

188
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,790
得9分或者10分才行
Like, nines or tens.

189
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,575
9分或者10分?
Nines or tens?

190
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,026
好吧  8分也认了  前提是她愿意
Okay, an eight is acceptable

191
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,297
带另一个8分的女生来一起和我泡按摩浴缸
If she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.

192
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,798
你的底线是不管我们找的是谁
Bottom line is you'll take

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,999
你都会要的  对伐?
Any woman who'll have you, right?

194
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,584
是滴  毫不犹豫滴
In a New Delhi minute.

195
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,539
我不记得你在我店里买过这些小人偶啊
I don't remember you buying these miniatures in my store.

196
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,974
呃
Oh, uh, yeah.

197
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,059
我是在亚马逊上网购的
I got 'em on Amazon.

198
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,544
当然  我明白的
Sure. I get it.

199
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:29,346
为什么要支持一个朋友呢?
Why support a friend

200
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,598
应该支持一个把你朋友的生计压垮的
When you can support a multinational conglomerate

201
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,518
跨国大企业才对嘛
That is crushing the life out of that friend?

202
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,889
我知道啦  不过网购的话  我可以在厕所就搞定了
I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.

203
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,223
你没见过我的店吗?
Have you seen my store?

204
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,742
整个店就和厕所没差别好吧
The whole place is a toilet.

205
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:44,227
我们能不能继续玩啊?
C-can we please move this along?

206
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,262
不好意思  继续玩
Yeah, sorry.

207
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:47,731
你来到了隧道的终点
Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel

208
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,916
找到一个大箱子
And find a large chest.

209
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:49,917
你会怎么做?
What do you do?

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,368
Howard  你别又说
And, Howard, do not say,

211
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,421
"我要对波波动手动脚" (chest又指胸部)
"i feel up the large chest."

212
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:56,790
你很过分哦  我现在是已婚男士了好伐
Excuse me, I'm a married man now.

213
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,242
我根本不打算说任何幼稚的话
I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.

214
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:00,210
很好  你会怎么做呢?
Great. what do you do?

215
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,211
我走到
I walk up

216
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,579
大箱子(波波)面前
To the large chest,

217
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:06,633
把我的脸埋在里面  然后就...
Bury my face in it and go .

218
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,938
我会打开箱子
I open the chest.

219
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,024
是锁着的  突然间你后面的门砰的关上了
It's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut

220
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:16,727
房间的墙开始向内移动
And now the walls of the room start closing in.

221
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:17,811
这可不妙啊
That's not good.

222
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:20,531
我和我的角色都有幽闭恐惧症
My character and I both have claustrophobia.

223
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:23,099
箱子上的发光字体写的是
Glowing letters appear on the chest that read,

224
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,602
"如果不想被挤爆的话 
"if squashed to death you wish not to be,

225
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,121
"请咏唱Svaty Vaclav和他的胜利"
"Sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."

226
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,273
-谁TMD是Svaty Vaclav?  -墙越来越近了
-Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?  -Walls are getting closer.

227
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,492
天啊  不怕 不怕
Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.

228
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:36,163
等等  Svaty Vaclav曾经是波西米亚的王
Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the duke of Bohemia.

229
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,464
还有10秒钟你就要被挤爆了
You're ten seconds away from getting crushed!

230
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,549
九  八...
Nine, eight...

231
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:39,550
我们该肿么办才好啊
What are we supposed to do?

232
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,335
-七  六...   -等等  等等
-...seven, six... -wait, wait.

233
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:44,054
Svaty Vaclav是维多利亚圣诞颂歌里
Svaty Vaclav is better known as good king Wenceslas

234
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,839
唱到的英明君主圣文萨斯雷
From the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.

235
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,224
从没听过
Never heard of it.

236
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,593
一定是唯一一首不是犹太人写的圣诞颂歌
Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.


237
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,728
倒数  三  二...
three, two...

238
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,480
你们谁赶紧快唱歌啊!
Somebody sing the damn song!

239
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,898
明君文氏凝望着圣人飨宴 
Good King Wenceslas looked out on the Feast of Stephen.

240
00:09:56,898 --> 00:10:00,134
积雪铺满大地  厚厚的雪地平坦又清脆
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.

241
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:01,822
墙移动得越来越慢
The walls are getting slower.

242
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:05,740
寒霜虽刺骨  夜月却皎洁
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel.

243
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,740
一个可怜的人儿  正收集着过冬的柴火
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.

244
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:16,036
墙不动了! 你们安全了!
The walls stop! you're safe!

245
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:17,704
你太厉害了  Sheldon
That was amazing, Sheldon.

246
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,456
-你怎么知道这首歌的?  -很简单
-How did you know that?  -That was simple.

247
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,842
我把波西米亚的著名历史事件
I combined a well-known, historical fact

248
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,844
和我祖父母的经历联系了一下
about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents,

249
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,430
爷爷奶奶过去经常唱圣诞颂歌给我听
Mee-maw and pop-pop, singing Christmas carols

250
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:29,016
而我就坐在火炉前  用乐高玩具的积木
while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build

251
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:31,718
想搭建一个高能粒子加速器
a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.

252
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,054
好的  继续冒险吧
Okay, continuing our quest.

253
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,155
等等
W-w-wait.

254
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:36,440
还有四段歌曲没唱呢
There's still four more verses.

255
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,191
唱歌就得把歌唱完
You don't sing a song and not finish it.

256
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:41,576
"到我身边  若你知道  请告诉我
"Hither, page, and stand by me, If thou know'st it, telling.

257
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:45,515
彼处的农夫是谁?他身住何方?又心系何处?"
Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling?"

258
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:48,335
寒霜虽刺骨  夜月却皎洁
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost...

259
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,063
看起来他混得挺好的
looks like he's doing pretty good.

260
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,179
当然啦
Of course he is.

261
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,398
你瞧 那个女孩刚被男友甩了
Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.

262
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,849
她恼羞成怒 又酩酊大醉
She's angry, she's drunk,

263
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:06,985
而且她最爱的电影还是"贫民窟的百万富翁"(印度电影)
and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire.

264
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:07,969
天时地利啊...
I mean...

265
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,471
这种是很好泡的妹子
That is some low-hanging fruit.

266
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,124
哦 他过来了
Oh, here he comes.

267
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,926
-怎么样?  -棒极了
-So, how'd it go?  -Great.

268
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,428
我请她喝了几杯酒
I bought her a couple of drinks,

269
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,296
然后她就把她的E-mail地址给我了
and she gave me her E-mail address.

270
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:19,998
有戏!
Ooh!

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,286
"jennifer@全世界男人死光了也不会找你.臭屌丝"
"jennifer@not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth.loser"

272
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:27,205
神马?
What?

273
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:28,673
很抱歉 Raj
I'm sorry, Raj.

274
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:31,259
为什么我就泡不到个妹子呢?
Why can't I find someone?

275
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,877
我聪明伶俐 工作又酷
I'm smart, I've got a cool job,

276
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,963
而且我天生的古铜色皮肤
and my naturally bronzed complexion

277
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,464
还能撑起芥末黄的衣服
means I can pull off mustard yellow

278
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,333
一般的汉子绝对撑不起来
in a way most guys can't.

279
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:41,335
哦亲爱的 不是你的问题 是她们的问题
Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.

280
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:42,336
不 不是的
No, it's not.

281
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,773
我配不上这么漂亮的
She was too beautiful for me.

282
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,308
-为什么这么说呢?  -这是事实
-Why would you say that?  -It's true.

283
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,728
我总是被得不到的女人所吸引
I'm always attracted to women I can't have.

284
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,062
我总是这样
I do it all the time.

285
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:53,347
对你们俩也是这样
I did the same thing with the two of you.

286
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,066
她们俩?
The two of them?

287
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:57,652
我不明白
I don't understand.

288
00:11:57,654 --> 00:12:01,189
曾经有段时间 我被Penny深深地吸引
Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny,

289
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:02,707
而我以为她也喜欢我
and I thought she was into me, too,

290
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,044
因为她酩酊大醉 又赤身裸体地
Because she got drunk and naked

291
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:05,293
和我滚了床单
and climbed in bed with me.

292
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:08,580
但显然我会错意了
But apparently I misread those signals.

293
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,667
而且你也喜欢过Bernadette?
And you liked Bernadette also?

294
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,586
那是在Penny之前
That was before Penny.

295
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,387
我规定自己一次只能
I make it a rule to only fall for

296
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,257
对一个哥们的女朋友动心
one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.

297
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,876
这方面我非常的传统
I'm very old-fashioned that way.

298
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:24,646
所以说  会不会 
So at, uh, some point,

299
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,849
你也对我动心了?
you probably had a thing for me, too.

300
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:31,402
不  那倒没有
No, not really.

301
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:37,108
拜托  Raj  总有一点点吧?
Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?

302
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,727
反正我是没想起来
Not that I can think of.

303
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,731
好好想想!
Think harder.

304
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,201
木有
Nope.

305
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,787
所谓心之所向行之所往
I guess the heart wants what the heart wants.

306
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:49,789
但是这种事  不是想有就能有的
Or in this case, doesn't.

307
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,590
真的是完全没有啊
I mean, at all.

308
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,045
怎么啦?
What?

309
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:05,283
你们若心向善之佑穷人  上天也会赐福你
Ye who now will bless the poor, Shall yourselves find blessing.

310
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:09,257
唱完了吧?
Done?

311
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,760
你该跟我说"唱得太棒了"吧
I think the word you're looking for is "bravo".

312
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,930
继续  你离开了那个房间  发现自己
Okay, you leave the room and find yourself

313
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,366
站在雪人融化后的一滩水前
standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

314
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:19,617
雪人融化后?
Melted snowmen?

315
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:21,786
那水滩里有胡萝卜和煤块吗?
Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?

316
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,071
不知道  有差别吗?
I don't know. What's the difference?

317
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,290
这是一个幻想游戏  Leonard
It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.

318
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,274
你得描绘出整个画面
Paint a picture.

319
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,325
好吧
Fine.

320
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,827
你离开了那个房间  发现自己
You leave the room and find yourself

321
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,545
站在雪人融化后的一滩水前
Standing before a pool of melted snowmen.

322
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,446
水里面还有胡萝卜和煤块
There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.

323
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:35,300
那雪人的大礼帽和玉米芯烟斗去哪了?
What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?

324
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,051
也在水里
You see those, too.

325
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,787
哦  我仿佛真的就站在那里
Oh, it's like I'm really there.

326
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:45,459
我不得不说  自从心理医生换了我的抗焦虑药
I gotta tell you, this-this is the most holiday fun I've had

327
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:48,629
而我也不再便血之后
since my therapist changed my anxiety medication

328
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:51,465
这是我过得最愉快的节日了
and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.

329
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,803
真会说话
Good story.

330
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,022
你在喝什么啊?
What are you drinking there?

331
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,073
蛋奶酒(圣诞节最具代表性的饮品)?
Little eggnog?

332
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,325
是呀
Yes.

333
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,609
怎么 有问题吗?
What, is there a problem?

334
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:04,662
没 就是挺高兴见你喝节日饮料的
No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage.

335
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:05,813
很有圣诞风情
Pretty Christmasy.

336
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,249
什么时候蛋奶酒变成圣诞饮料了?
Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?

337
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,286
一年到头都有鸡蛋
Eggs are available all year round.

338
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:14,539
我在游泳池边也喝这个
I've been known to enjoy this poolside.

339
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,624
拜托  Sheldon
Come on, Sheldon.

340
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,659
你知道所有的圣诞故事  圣诞颂歌
You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols,

341
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,879
你把蛋奶酒都喝到嘴唇上了
You've got an eggnog mustache going on there.

342
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,163
你就承认吧
Just admit it.

343
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,765
你就是越来越有圣诞情节了
You're getting a little yuletide spirit.

344
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,266
一派胡言
Oh, don't be silly.

345
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:26,727
圣诞节不过就是工业批量生产出的金属穗子
Christmas is a bunch of baloney

346
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,186
编成的一串串闪亮的鬼话而已
created by the tinsel industry.

347
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,005
为什么你一定要这么坚持呢?
Why is this so important to you?

348
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,107
老实说  是因为我小时候受够了没氛围的圣诞节
Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid

349
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,193
所以你就别再糟蹋圣诞节的乐趣了行不
And I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.

350
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:37,028
为什么你小时候的圣诞节过得很糟?
What was so bad about them?

351
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,948
我生活在一个学术氛围疯狂浓厚的家庭里
I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.

352
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,150
我们给圣诞老人留的不是牛奶和饼干
Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies,

353
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:44,452
而是一份研究报告
We had to leave him a research paper.

354
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:48,356
第二天早餐  你知道圣诞老人已经来过了
And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there

355
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,124
因为他给这份研究报告打了分
Because the paper would be graded.

356
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,794
怪不得你这么爱圣诞节
No wonder you love Christmas.

357
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:55,046
听起来太美好了
That sounds amazing.

358
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,031
这不是美好
It wasn't amazing.

359
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,867
连续四年都是C-
I got a c-minus four years in a row.

360
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,369
我晓得你的论文水平
Yeah, I'm familiar with your work.

361
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,720
C-就算一份大礼了
C-minus was your gift.

362
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:08,559
Amy  我深感抱歉
Amy, I'm really sorry.

363
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,311
没有伤害你的意思
I didn't mean to upset you.

364
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:11,646
没事的
It's fine.

365
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,881
我曾经就是个看一眼就够了的女生
I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice.

366
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,901
22岁才献出初吻
I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22,

367
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:20,054
还是因为我抢了他的胰岛素 非要他亲我才还他
And the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.

368
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:26,444
强扭的瓜不甜
Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.

369
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,613
让往事随风而去吧
Forget it.

370
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,164
没指望你们会理解我
I don't expect you guys to understand.

371
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,749
我懂
I understand.

372
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,751
七年级玩转瓶子时
In seventh grade, I played spin the bottle

373
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,403
瓶子转到了Alina Shankar那里
And it landed on alina shankar.

374
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,038
她说如果我靠近她
She said if I came near her,

375
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,657
她就摔了瓶子 刺向我身
She would break the bottle and cut me.

376
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,209
你就那点承受力?
You think that's bad?

377
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,244
大学参加兄弟会联谊时我晕了过去
In college, I passed out at a frat party

378
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,680
醒来时  穿得衣服反倒更多了
（美国常有这种在兄弟会上迷醉女生然后性侵的事件）
And woke up with more clothes on.

379
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,469
有时  我寂寞难耐
Sometimes I get so lonely,

380
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,855
就用屁屁压住左手  直到它发麻
I sit on my left hand until it goes numb,

381
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:56,107
然后紧握住右手
Then I put it in my right hand and pretend

382
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,592
假装再和别人牵手
I'm holding hands with another person.

383
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,562
我也是
I do that, too.

384
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:03,764
有时  左手想要抚摸我
Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.

385
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,785
我便会顺从
And I let it.

386
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:12,206
有人掏心窝真好
It's kind of nice to talk to someone

387
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,459
终于有人能体会我的孤单了
Who understands what it feels like to be alone.

388
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,744
是啊  你说呢?
It is, isn't it?

389
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,612
可你现在不是孑然一身了啊  你有Sheldon
But you're not alone anymore. now you've got Sheldon.

390
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:19,914
确实
I do.

391
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,967
别惆怅  你总会找到你的公主的
And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.

392
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,335
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:28,256
她有你一半的聪颖动人  我就知足了
I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.

394
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,676
Rajesh  谢谢你
Thank you, Rajesh.

395
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,594
他看上我了 太欣慰了 撤吧
He wants me, I'm good. We can go now.

396
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:36,981
娘的
Damn it.

397
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,349
又咋了?
What?

398
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,184
就因为她对我不感兴趣
Now that I know she doesn't like me,

399
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:42,286
我就有点喜欢她了呢
I'm kind of into her.

400
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,556
好啦
All right.

401
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:49,394
我差不多破解放下吊桥的密码了
I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.

402
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:50,811
不错  快试试
Great. let's do it.

403
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,203
吊桥在下降
The drawbridge is lowering.

404
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,045
我的腕管病犯了
My carpal tunnel's acting up.

405
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,463
忍住!
Play through the pain!

406
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,692
成功了  吊桥下降了
You did it! the drawbridge is down.

407
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,277
你们穿过峡谷
You cross the chasm

408
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,114
发现自己进入一间小地牢
And find yourself in a small dungeon room.

409
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:28,766
在角落里
And in the corner, chained to the wall,

410
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:31,352
伤痕累累的圣诞老人被拴在墙上
You see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.

411
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:35,022
他说  "哦  救我"
He says, "ho, ho, help me."

412
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,542
耶  找到圣诞老公公了呢!
Yes, we found Santa!

413
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:39,544
圣诞节得救啦!
Christmas is saved!

414
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,213
不要告诉我妈我说过这话
Don't ever tell my mother I said that.

415
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,199
我拿出骷髅钥匙
I take out my skeleton key

416
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,968
奔向圣诞老人  去解救他
And run to Santa to unchain him.

417
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,970
但我先施了麻痹咒语
But first, I cast a spell of paralysis

418
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,422
-给Stuart和Howard  -等等  你要干嘛?
-On Stuart and Howard.  -Wait, what are you doing?

419
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:53,741
你不能说话  你被定住了
You can't talk; you're paralyzed.

420
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:57,678
我冲着圣诞公公的圆盘脸  说
I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say...

421
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,213
啧啧啧
Well, well, well,

422
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:01,899
我们又见面了  你这个成天笑嘻嘻的老头
Jolly old saint nick, we meet again.

423
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,584
没记错的话  咱俩的上一次对话
Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke

424
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:06,654
是在德州加尔维斯顿的Baybrook超市
Was in the baybrook mall in Galveston, Texas,

425
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,906
那时我才五岁  不是么?
When I was five years old, isn't that right?

426
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:11,125
那个  是吧
Uh, okay.

427
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:12,560
我妈非要我去的
My mother dragged me there

428
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,445
她把我放在你腿上
And she plopped me down on your lap

429
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:16,747
你问我  圣诞节想要什么礼物
And you asked me what I wanted for Christmas.

430
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,699
我告诉你  "我要爷爷"
And I told you "my pop-pop"

431
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,235
那年爷爷去世了
Because that was the year my grandfather died.

432
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:24,071
我好想他  想让他回到身边
I missed him and I wanted him back.

433
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:27,425
这太诡异了吧?
This is weird, right?

434
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,346
爷爷是家里
Pop-pop was the only one in my family

435
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:34,215
唯一鼓励我追求科学的人
Who encouraged me to pursue science.

436
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:36,417
但你没把他带回来  是吧!
But you didn't bring him back, did you?

437
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,137
你就给我送了一盒林肯原木牌积木
Instead, I got Lincoln logs.

438
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,982
用积木
Well, you can build a lot of

439
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,090
倒是可以搭很多东西
neat things out of Lincoln logs

440
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,942
可造不出一个爷爷
But pop-pop ain't one of 'em.

441
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:48,262
你现在倒是有求于我
And now you're here asking me for something--

442
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:49,597
想要我救你了
To save you.

443
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,934
不过  抱歉了先生  天有不测风云
Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day.

444
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:55,486
你就在这里腐烂吧
I'm leaving you here to rot,

445
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,156
希望你成为食人魔的大餐
And I hope the ogres feast on your bones.

446
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:01,709
我把骷髅钥匙扔进峡谷中
I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm,

447
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:03,711
临走时
And on the way out, I give Santa

448
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:06,747
冲着他的大啤酒肚 敏捷的踢了一脚
A swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!

449
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,468
漂亮
Okay.

450
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,671
那么  Wolowitz和Stuart被定住 圣诞老人挂了
So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead,

451
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:17,124
就为了这  我放弃了和女朋友爱爱的机会
And I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.

452
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,583
圣诞公公?
Santa?

453
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:41,071
哦  你好  Sheldon
Oh, hello, Sheldon.

454
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:43,290
你不是该睡觉么
You should be asleep.

455
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:45,408
你靴子的铃铛吵醒我了
Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.

456
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,660
这样啊...
Oh...

457
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,113
我一直想和你谈谈
I've been wanting to talk to you.

458
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:54,301
抱歉让儿时的你伤心了
I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy.

459
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:58,788
我有很多魔法
I...I can do a lot of magical things,

460
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,066
只可惜  让你的爷爷回来
But unfortunately bringing your

461
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,343
我却无能为力
pop-pop back isn't one of them

462
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,296
我懂得
I understand.

463
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:09,683
可我为你准备了另一份礼物
But i-i do have something special for you.

464
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,302
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

465
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:16,639
要是火车就好了
Oh, I hope it's a train.

466
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,826
是更好的哟
Oh, it's better than a train.

467
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:23,079
两辆火车?
Two trains?

468
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,814
比那还要好
Better.

469
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,000
我会得到三辆火车吗?
I'm getting three trains.

470
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,870
好了  打开吧
Okay, open 'em.

471
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,659
让你把我丢在地牢
This is for leaving me in the dungeon

472
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,512
被食人魔活活吃掉!
to be eaten alive by ogres!

473
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,964
等等  
Wait, uh, uh, hang on.

474
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,048
我那是因为..
I-in my defense...

475
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,551
吼  吼  吼  你这个书呆子!
Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork!
