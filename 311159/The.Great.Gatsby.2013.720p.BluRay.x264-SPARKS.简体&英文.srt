13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,610
在我年纪尚轻  涉世未深的时候
In my younger and more vulnerable years,

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,740
父亲曾这样告诫我
my father gave me some advice.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
"多发掘他人身上的闪光点"
"Always try to see the best in people," he would say.

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,840
父亲的教诲使我不对他人妄加评判
As a consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments.

17
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,420
但我的忍耐也是有限度的
But even I have a limit.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,180
那时  我们每天都醉生梦死
Back then, all of us drank too much.

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,520
越是与时俱进
The more in tune with the times we were,

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,900
越是长醉不醒
the more we drank.

21
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,650
我们也越是陈旧迂腐
And none of us contributed anything new.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,970
帕金斯疗养院

23
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,530
我从纽约回来时  心中深感厌恶
When I came back from New York, I was disgusted.

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,700
我明白  卡罗威先生
I see, Mr. Carraway.

25
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,080
对周围所有的人和事感到厌恶无比
Disgusted with everyone and everything.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,230

28

除了一个人之外
Only one man was exempt from my disgust.

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,140
一个人
One man?

30
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,810
卡罗威先生
Mr. Carraway?

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,060
盖茨比
Gatsby.

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,570
医嘱  1929年12月1日  初次问诊  盖茨比

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,020
他是你的朋友吗
Was he a friend of yours?

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,220
他是我见过的最乐观的人
He was the single most hopeful person I've ever met.

35
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,910
而且是绝无仅有的
And am ever likely to meet again.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,840
他对周围发生的事十分敏感
There was something about him, a sensitivity.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,960
就像
He was like,

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,780
就像一台地震仪
he was like one of those machines

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,010
能探测到万里之外的地震
that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away.

40
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,680
你是怎么认识他的
Where'd you meet him?

41
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,940
在纽约的
At a, at a party

42
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,360
派对上认识的
in New York.

43
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,780
那是1922年夏天
In the summer of 1922,

44
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,900
城市发展的脚步越来越快
the tempo of the city approached.

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,530
几近疯狂
Hysteria.

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,050
股价暴涨至史上最高点
Stocks reached record peaks,

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,200
华尔街在呼啸而来的金融大潮中一派昌盛
and Wall Street boomed in a steady golden roar.

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,350
派对排场越发奢华
The parties were bigger.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,970
秀场演出越发气派
The shows were broader.

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,930
摩天大楼直冲云霄
The buildings were higher.

51
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,820
道德底线逐渐沦丧
The morals were looser,

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,040
禁酒令反而使私酒泛滥
and the ban on alcohol had backfired

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,730
越演越烈
making the liquor cheaper.

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,450
华尔街吸引着充满野心的年轻人
Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious.

55
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,790
我就是其中之一
And I was one of them.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,670
我在距市区20英里的长岛租了一间房子
I rented a house 20 miles from the city on Long Island.

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,470
我住在西卵区
I lived at West Egg

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,580
一栋无人修葺的小别墅里
in a forgotten groundskeeper's cottage,

59
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,930
被暴发户们的豪宅包围
squeezed among the mansions of the newly rich.

60
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,130
为了尽快上手  我买了一整套
To get started, I bought a dozen volumes

61
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,970
有关信贷  金融和投资的书籍
on credit, banking and investments.

62
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,270
我对此一窍不通
All new to me.

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,190
股市再创新高
The stock market hit another high.

64
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,390
大盘持续走高
The market's moving up, up, up!

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
不过凡事都有风险
Well, of course, nothing is 100 percent.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,810
换我就不会孤注一掷
I wouldn't go investing every penny.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,910
《尤利西斯》

68
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,530
在耶鲁大学时我曾梦想当一名作家
At Yale I dreamed of being a writer

69
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,650
不过最终彻底放弃
but I gave all that up.

70
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,160
在炎炎夏日与繁盛的树荫下
With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees,

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,910
我本打算在学习中度过整个夏天
I planned to spend the summer studying.

72
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,340
第一章  市场投资

73
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,020
计划未能如愿  却也是件好事
And I probably would have were it not,

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,330
因为我那素未谋面的邻居盖茨比
for the riotous amusements that beckoned

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,980
在他那巨大城堡内举办的盛大派对
from beyond the walls of that colossal castle

76
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,470
已经勾走了我的魂
owned by a gentleman I had not yet met named Gatsby.

77
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,980
那他是你的邻居了
So, he was your neighbor.

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,980
我的邻居  是的
My neighbor. Yeah.

79
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,490
仔细想想  那个难忘的夏季起始于
When I think about it, the history of the summer really began

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,830
我驱车去表妹黛西家吃晚餐的那一夜
the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy's for dinner.

81
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,810
她住在对岸东卵区
She lived across the bay in old moneyed,

82
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,460
一座祖传庭院里
East Egg.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,380
她丈夫是美国最富有的家族之一的继承人
Her husband was heir to one of America's wealthiest families.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,140
他的名字叫汤姆·布坎南
His name was Tom Buchanan.

85
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,650
我们就读于耶鲁时  他还是个运动健将
When we were at Yale together, he'd been a sporting star.

86
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,820
但那些都是英雄往事了
But now his glory days were behind him

87
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,960
他现在安于...
and he contented himself with...

88
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,900
您的电话  布坎南先生
Telephone, Monsieur Buchanan.

89
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,040
-是我  -一些风流韵事
- It's me. - other affairs.

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,650
不是告诉过你别打到这儿来吗
I thought I told you not to call me here.

91
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
波阿斯
Boaz!

92
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,990
波阿斯是《圣经》中的富豪  莎士比亚是人尽皆知的文豪

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,990
莎士比亚

95

你那本伟大的美国小说写得怎样了
How's the great American novel coming?

96
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,250
我最近在沃尔特·切斯的公司卖证券呢
I'm selling bonds with Walter Chase's outfit.

97
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,790
晚饭后和我一起去镇上
Let's say after dinner, you and I, we go into town.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,330
-不行  -带你去见见老弟兄
- I can't. - Catch up with the old wolf pack.

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,500
-明天还上班  -废话  让你去就去
- Big day on the job tomorrow. - Nonsense! We're going.

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,420
全美第一
First team, all-American.

101
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,300
看见没
You see?

102

造就了今天的我
Made me who I am today.

森林山[纽约长岛赛场]
Forest Hills.

104
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,970
大败威尔士亲王队那帮娘娘腔
Played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,890

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,930
只要你有一技之长
If you're any good.

107
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,710
亨利
Henri!

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,500
你在哪儿呢
Where are you?

109
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,090
这几扇门
The doors.

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,550
给我关上
Close them.

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,930
-抱歉  -谢谢
- Sorry. - Thank you.

112
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,970
是你吗  亲爱的
Is that you, my lovely?

113
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,850
黛西·布坎南  绝代佳人
Daisy Buchanan, the golden girl.

114
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,980
她散发着一股令人窒息的热情
A breathless warmth flowed from her.

115
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,980
仿佛在这世上除你之外
A promise that there was no one else

116
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,740
她谁也不想见
in the world she so wanted to see.

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,860
芝加哥那些人想我了吗
Do they miss me in Chicago?

118
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,910
是的  不少人托我带个好
Yes. Um, at least a dozen people send their love.

119
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,790
真不错
How gorgeous.

120
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,080
没有你的日子他们悲痛欲绝
They're absolutely in mourning.

121
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,460
-他们愁眉苦脸  真的  -瞎说
- They're crying. Yes. - No.

122
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,830
-才不信你  -抱头痛哭
- I don't believe you. - Wailing.

123
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,290
-我才不信你呢  -仰天长啸
- I don't believe you. - They're screaming.

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,550
"黛西·布坎南  没有你我们活不了"
"Daisy Buchanan, we can't live without you!"

125
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,880
我高兴死了
I'm paralyzed with happiness.

126
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,510
乔丹·贝克  著名高尔夫球手
Jordan Baker. A very famous golfer.

127
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
《纽约闲谈》

128
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,640
她是我见过的最让人手足无措的人
She was the most frightening person I'd ever seen.

129
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,440
我在《运动人生》的封面上见过你的照片
Well, I've seen your face on the cover of Sporting Life.

130
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,110
尼克·卡罗威
Nick Carraway.

131
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,610
但能注视着她仍是一桩美差
But I enjoyed looking at her.

132
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,860
我在沙发上躺得太久了
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.

133
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,020
这个夏天我要把你俩撮合到一块去
This summer I'll fling you two together.

134
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,660
我会让你们盛装打扮
I'll push you into linen closets,

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,280
然后一起出海游玩
and out to sea in boats!

136
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,910
-想得美  -对了  尼克
- I'm not listening to a word. - So, Nick,

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,330
黛西说你住在西卵区那边
Daisy tells me that you're over in West Egg throwing your lot in

138
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,790
和那些攀高结贵的暴发户们住一起
with those social-climbing primitive new-money types.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,460
我不过租了间每月80块的陋居罢了
My little shack's just a cardboard box at 80 a month.

140
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,420
你过得真有意思
Your life is adorable.

141
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,670
我倒是认识一个西卵区的人
I know somebody in West Egg.

142
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,430
我和那边的人还没来往过呢
I don't know a single person that side of the bay.

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,220
但你一定听说过盖茨比
You must know Gatsby.

144
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,760
盖茨比
Gatsby?

145
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
哪个盖茨比
What Gatsby?

146
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,830
夫人  晚膳已备齐
Madame, the dinner is servi.

147
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,620
想听听咱家的秘密吗
Would you like to hear a family secret?

148
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,750
-洗耳恭听  -是有关管家的鼻子的
- That's why I came over. - It's about the butler's nose.

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,330
事情变得每况愈下
Things went from bad to worse.

150
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,170
我不喜欢"大老粗"这个词
I hate that word "Hulking."

151
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,040
尼克  听说你准备娶一个
Nicky, I heard a rumor that you were getting married

152
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,840
-西卵区的姑娘  -哪有的事
- to a girl out West. - It's a libel.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,970
我没钱啊
I'm too poor.

154
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,460
除非找个老女人准备坐吃遗产
They have to be old so they die quickly.

155
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,670
咱换个话题行吗
Can't we talk about something else?

156
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,090
什么都好  谈谈作物收成吧
Anything. Crops.

157
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,430
你让我觉得自己像野蛮人  黛西
You're making me feel uncivilized, Daisy.

158
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,140
文明已经要四分五裂了
Civilization's going to pieces.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,180
你读过戈达德写的那本
Have you read The Rise of the Colored Empires

160
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,800
《黑色帝国的崛起》吗
by this fellow Goddard?

161
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,580
人们都该读读这本书
Everybody ought to read it.

162
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,120
如果白人再掉以轻心的话
The idea is that it's up to us, the dominant race to watch out

163
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,700
别的种族就要主宰一切了
or these other races will have control of things.

164
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,390
汤姆近来看问题比较长远
Tom's very profound lately.

165
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,820
他读了很多晦涩难懂的书籍
He reads deep books with long words in them.

166
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,030
这是有根据的
It's been proved.

167
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,290
是科学的道理
It's scientific.

168
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,540
我们得消灭这些苗头
We've got to beat them down.

169
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,590
布坎南府邸
Buchanan residence.

170
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,630
是汽车修理厂的威尔逊先生打来的
Monsieur Wilson, from the garage.

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,010
布坎南先生
Monsieur Buchanan.

172
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
不好意思  我去去就来
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

173
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,480
抱歉
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,980
你提到的这个盖茨比先生
Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of,

175
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,820
-他就住我隔壁  -嘘  别说话
- he's my neighbor. - Shh! Don't talk.

176
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,320
我想听听他们在说什么
I wanna hear what happens.

177
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,530
我不管你用什么方法...
I don't care what you do...

178
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,950
出了什么事吗
Something happening?

179
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,870
-我还以为众人皆知呢  -我就不知道
- Why, I thought everybody knew. - Well, I don't.

180
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
-汤姆在纽约有了外遇  -外遇
- Tom's got some woman in New York. - Got some woman?

181
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,210
她或许不懂晚饭时不该打过来
She might have the decency not to telephone at dinnertime.

182
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,250
你说呢
Don't you think?

183
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,850
你嫌我管太宽吗
Is that too much to ask?

184
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,300
黛西  不要无事生非
Daisy, don't create a scene.

185
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,040
你能上我这儿吃晚餐真好  尼克
I love seeing you at my table, Nicky.

186
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,140
你让我想到玫瑰  他难道不像玫瑰吗
You remind me of a rose. An absolute rose, doesn't he?

187
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,430
-等下吃完饭  -我可没玫瑰那么脆弱
- So after dinner, - Well, I'm not even faintly like a rose.

188
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,770
尼克想去镇上逛逛  对吧
Nick wanted to go into town. Right, Nick?

189
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,830
去耶鲁俱乐部
To the Yale Club.

190
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,870
尼克  就待在这儿吧
Nicky, stay.

191
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,020
明天我还得早起上班呢
I have to work early.

192
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,980
胡说
Nonsense.

193
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,020
-还有好多话没说  -就去喝几杯而已
- There's so much to talk about. - It's just for a drink or two.

194
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,500
第五次急切而刺耳的电话铃声
None of us could ignore that fifth guest's

195
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,240
牵动了每个人的神经
shrill metallic urgency.

196
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
-尼克  -怎么了
- Nicky. - What?

197
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,540
就是  我觉得一切都糟透了
It's just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow.

198
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,960
-是吗  -是的
- Really? - Yes.

199
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,300
我周游各地  看遍世间百态
I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.

200
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,130
我曾经有一段低谷时期  尼克
I've had a very bad time, Nicky.

201
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,930
导致我现在有点愤世嫉俗
I'm pretty cynical about everything.

202
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,270
你女儿一切都好吧
Your daughter, I suppose she talks and eats and everything?

203
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
你说帕米
Pammy?

204
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,980
是的
Oh, yes.

205
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,760
尼克  她出生的时候
Listen, Nick, when she was born,

206
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,820
天知道汤姆在哪
Tom was God knows where.

207
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,660
和谁鬼混在一起
with God knows whom.

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,830
我问护士
And I asked the nurse

209
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,670
是男孩还是女孩
if it was a boy or a girl.

210
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,340
她说是女孩
And she said it was a girl

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,380
我哭着说
and I wept:

212
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,760
真庆幸是个女孩
"I'm glad it's a girl.

213
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,970
我希望她做个傻姑娘
And I hope she'll be a fool.

214
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,680
傻姑娘才是最幸福的
That's the best thing a girl in this world can be.

215
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,730
美丽的傻姑娘
A beautiful little fool."

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,730
华美珍贵的事物总是很快逝去
All the bright, precious things fade so fast.

217
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,610
而且一去不复返
And they don't come back.

218
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,230
我回到家
When I arrived home

219
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,810
发现邻居家的码头上
I noticed that a figure

220
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,480
出现了一个身影
had emerged on my neighbor's dock.

221
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,570
直觉告诉我  他就是
And something told me it was

222
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,370
盖茨比先生
Mr. Gatsby.

223
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,460
他似乎伸着手
He seemed to be reaching toward

224
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,800
在黑暗中摸索着什么
something out there in the dark.

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,560
那束绿光
The green light.

226
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,320
我不想再说了  医生
I don't wanna talk about this, doctor.

227
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,820
那就写下来
Then write about it.

228
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,990
-写下来吗  -是的
- Write about it? - Yes.

229
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,290
为什么要写呢
Why would I do that?

230
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,910
你说过写作能给你带来慰藉
You said yourself writing brought you solace.

231
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,040
是的  但却不能给别人带去慰藉
Yeah, well, it didn't bring anyone else much solace.

232
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,460
我写得不好
I wasn't any good.

233
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,340
又不是给人看的
No one need ever read it.

234
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,380
你可以烧掉
You could always burn it.

235
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,140
写些什么呢
What would I write about?

236
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,890
什么都行
Anything.

237
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
只要能让你安心的东西都可以写
Whatever brings you ease:

238
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,190
一段回忆
a memory

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,070
一点想法  一个地方
a thought, a place.

240
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,740
写下来
Write it down.

241
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,160
一个地方
A place.

242
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,790
灰之谷是个怪异的地方
The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place.

243
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,830
它是纽约的垃圾场
New York's dumping ground

244
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,680
在西卵区和城区之间
halfway between West Egg and the city

245
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,220
它的煤炭
where the burnt-out coal

246
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,640
点燃了纽约的纸醉金迷
that powered the booming golden city

247
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,060
但它已支离破碎
was discarded by men who moved dimly

248
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,020
在这漫天尘土中
and already crumbling

249
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,560
也无人愿意停留
through the powdery air.

250
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,110
这个古怪的农场
This fantastic farm

251
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,060
一直在T·J·埃克伯格医生的注视下
was ever watched by Dr. T.J. Eckleburg

252
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,370
他虽然被人遗忘
A forgotten oculist

253
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,430
却审视着这里
whose eyes brooded over it all

254
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,900
就像上帝之眼
like the eyes of God.

255
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,740
汤姆邀请我进城
Tom had invited me to town,

256
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,830
肯定是去参加耶鲁俱乐部的午宴

什么时候把车卖给我
So when are you gonna sell me that car?

274
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,580
我正让人修着呢
Oh, I've still got my man working on it.

275
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,830
他修得也太慢了  不是吗
Yeah, well, he works pretty slow, don't he?

276
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
也许该卖给别人
Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else.

277
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,130
别  别  别

如果是谈生意的话  得跟我谈

我真得走了
I really must go.

326

327
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,810

330
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,560
-我要走了  我得出去了  -胡闹
- I'm going. I've gotta get out of here. - Nonsense!

331
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,110
进去和凯瑟琳说说话
Go on in there and talk to Catherine.

332
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,940
我觉得不自在  黛西可是我表妹
I'm not comfortable. Daisy's my cousin.

333
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,280
我知道你不爱凑热闹  大学时就是这样
Listen, I know you like to watch. I remember that from college.

334
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,360
不  不  我不是指责你
No, no, no, I don't make any judgment.

335
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,740
我们有整个夏天来潇洒
We have all summer.

336
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,870
你是想袖手旁观呢
Now, do you wanna sit on the sideline and watch,

337
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,290
还是想参与进来
or do you wanna play ball?

338
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500

Play ball.

341
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,130
他是要袖手旁观
He's gonna sit on the side and watch, huh?

342
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,590
还是来乐呵乐呵
Or is he gonna play ball?

343
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,840
摘掉帽子  留下来
Take off your hat and stay a while.

344
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,680
对了  尼克

348
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,020
-偶尔会写作  但...  -真的吗
- I write a little, but... - Really?

349
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,770
你也住长岛吗
Do you live on Long Island too?

350
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,710
我住在西卵区
I live at West Egg.

351
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,560
大概一个月前  我去那参加过派对
I was there at a party about a month ago.

352
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,990
有个叫盖茨比的  认识吗
A man named Gatsbys. Do you know him?

353
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,650
我就住在他隔壁
I live right next door to him.

354
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,570
他是德皇威廉的表亲

355

把这照下来
Take a picture of that.

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,620
别这样  我才不是那种模特呢
Don't, I'm not one of those models.

359
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,710
如果你想拍也可以
You can if you want.

360
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,090
他们俩都受不了自己家的那口子
Neither of them can stand the person they're married to.

361
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,430
她也不喜欢威尔逊吗
Doesn't she like Wilson either?

362
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
他是个谄上媚下的人渣
He's a greasy little scumbag.

363
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,770
不了  谢谢  不用喝就已经飘飘然了
No, thanks, I feel just as good on nothing at all.

364
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,480
治疗神经的药
Nerve pills.

365
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,560
我在皇后区的一个医生那搞到的
I get them from a doctor in Queens.

366
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,940
你也来一片吗
Do you want one?

367
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,230
不  我的神经没问题  谢谢
Oh, no. My nerves are fine, thanks.

368
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,950
我一生中只醉过两次
I had been drunk just twice in my life.

369
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,830
第二次就是在那天下午
And the second time was that afternoon.

370
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,460
那晚
That night,

371
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,210
在汤姆为桃金娘准备的藏身公寓里
in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle

372
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,130
我们借着酒劲  买醉狂欢
we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness.

373
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,390
我们内心深处对狂欢的渴望
A willingness of the heart

374
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,390
雷鸣般迸发出来
that burst thunderously upon us all.

375
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,850
突然间
And suddenly,

376
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,560
我开始喜欢上了纽约
I began to like New York.

377
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,640
这比耶鲁俱乐部棒多了
This is better than the Yale Club.

378
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,260
我们这排高踞在城市上空的
High over the city

379
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,200
灯火通明的窗子
our yellow windows

380
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,180
必定给街上观望的过客
must have contributed their share of human secrets

381
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,400
增添了神秘感
to the casual watcher in the street.

382
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,570
我曾经也像他一样
And I was him too,

383
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,320
仰望又寻思着
looking up and wondering.

384
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,110
我既置身事内
I was within

385
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,780
又超乎其外
and without.

386
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,080
我对人生的变幻莫测
Enchanted and repelled

387
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,500
既感陶醉  又感厌恶
by the inexhaustible variety of life.

388
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,180
你没权利说她的名字
You have got no right to speak her name.

389
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,600
黛西  黛西  黛西
Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!

390
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,580
你没权利说她的名字
You got no right to speak her name!

391
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,140
我想说就说...
I'll speak her name whenever...

392
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,860
天啊  你疯了
Oh, my God, you are crazy!

393
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
臭婊子
You whore!

394
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,440
他们会把你抓起来
They're gonna arrest you!

395
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,830
不知道我是怎么回的家
I have no clue how I got home

396
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,380
但我醒来时
but I do know that

397
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,920
着实有种不安的感觉
I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling

398
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,800
觉得盖茨比在盯着我
that Gatsby was watching me.

399
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,510
盯着你
Watching you?

400
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,890
是的
Yes.

401
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,430
盖茨比一直在盯着我
Gatsby was always watching me.

402
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,440
你怎么知道的
And how did you know that?

403
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,820
我收到一份邀请
I got an invitation.

404
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,190
只有我收到了邀请
I was the only one.

405
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
我是说  除我之外
By which I mean no one except me

406
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,990
恐怕没人真正收到过盖茨比家的邀请
ever received an actual invitation to Gatsby's.

407
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,230
亲爱的卡罗威先生  还望赏光我的小派对  您真诚的杰·盖茨比

408
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,540
其他纽约人
You see, the rest of New York

409
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,540
都是不请自来
simply came uninvited.

410
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,800
全市的人三五成群地搭车而来

挤破了盖茨比家的大门

417
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,030
闪开
Out of the way!

大厅里满是

沙滩上是炫耀遗产的小姐们

我老板沃尔特·切斯在轮盘赌上输了钱

八卦写手伺机而动

432
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,060
请问派对主人盖茨比先生在哪里
Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby?

433
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,320
我就住隔壁
I live just next door.

434
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,610

Gatsby?

435
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,750
先生  我从未见过盖茨比先生
I've never seen Mr. Gatsby, sir.

436
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,030
根本没人见过他
Why, no one has.

437
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,930
孤身一人  又碰了一鼻子灰
Alone, and a little embarrassed.

438
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,800
我决定不醉不休

你收到邀请函了吗
Did you get an invitation?

445
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,830
来盖茨比家是不用邀请函的
People aren't invited to Gatsby's.

446

好像就我收到了
Seems I'm the only one.

不对不对  他是德皇的杀手
No, no, no. He's the Kaiser's assassin.

454
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,030
-听说他杀过人  -没错
- I heard he killed a man once. - It's true.

455
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,680
就是杀着玩而已  也没被抓
Kills for fun, free of charge.

456
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,530
绝对是有通天的本领

457
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,100
你不会真相信他杀过人吧
You don't really believe he killed a man, do you?

458

找到他以后  你自己问问不就知道了

470
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,470

你们找不到他的
You won't find him.

479
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,700
这房子只不过是
This house and everything in it are all part

480
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,620
精心布置的假象
of an elaborate disguise.

481
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,910
而盖茨比先生并不存在
But Mr. Gatsby doesn't exist.

482
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
呸  我碰到过他
Phooey. I've met him.

483
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,880
是吗  是哪一个身份的他呢
Really? Which one?

484
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,460
是王子
The prince?

485
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,760
还是间谍
The spy?

486
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,470
亦或是杀人犯
The murderer?

487
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,390
我找不出一个
I cannot find anyone

488
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,720
了解一点真实内幕的人
who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby.

489
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,720
我不在乎
Well, I don't care.

490
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,430
他办了这么多大型派对
He gives large parties

491
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,980
很合我心意
and I like large parties.

有很多私人空间
They're so intimate.

493
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,610
派对小了  哪儿都能撞见人
Small parties, there isn't any privacy.

494
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,400
假如你说的是对的
But if that's true,

495
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,280
这又是为了什么
what's all this for?

496
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,740
我亲爱的朋友
That, my dear fellow

497
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,300
这是个问题

498
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,250
准备好了吗

小小派对  无伤大雅

你看起来好眼熟
Your face is familiar.

516

您战时曾在第三师吗

517
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,560
-对  在第九营  -我在第七营

听说是德皇的三表弟
They say he's third cousin to the Kaiser,

526
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,760
又是魔鬼的二堂弟

527
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,200
恕我招待不周  老伙计
I'm afraid I haven't been a very good host, old sport.

528
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,670
我
You see,

529
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,870

他的微笑是如此不寻常
His smile was one of those rare smiles

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,360
人这一生也难得几回见

这微笑似乎在告诉你
It seemed to understand you,

534
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,220
他理解你  信任你

恰如你内心深处的渴望

536
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,400
抱歉老伙计  我还以为你知道
Sorry, old sport. I thought you knew.

537
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,090
那个...我不知道说什么  不好意思
Please just... I don't know what to say. Please forgive me.

-没事  -我喝多了

550
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,480
我先失陪了
Excuse me.

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,230
过会儿再来
I will rejoin you later.

552
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,960
我以为他...
I expected him to be...

553
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,110
-是个大腹便便的糟老头吗  -对
- Old and fat? - Yes.

554

年轻人是不会突然冒出来

在长岛买座豪宅的

556
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,990
他说他以前在牛津读书
He told me once he was an Oxford man.

557
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,580
可我不相信
However, I don't believe it.

558
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,830
为什么
Why not?

559
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,000
不知道  就是不信
I don't know. I just don't believe he went there.

560
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,400
抱歉
I beg your pardon.

561
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,210

Nick!

567
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,820
尼克
Nick!

568
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,330
我刚才听到了最骇人的消息
I've just heard the most shocking thing.

569
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,560
你去哪里了  车等着呢
Where have you been? The car's waiting.

570
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,930
-快  得走了  -简直让人目瞪口呆
- Come on, we're leaving. - Simply amazing.

571
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,280
这就说得通了
It all makes sense.

572
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,380
解释了这一切
It all makes sense.

573
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,040
明白了吧
Come on.

574
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,870
-什么意思  -所有
- What makes sense? - Everything!

575
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,060
快点  别闹了
Come on, this is crazy!

576
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,900
-我们得走了  -但我只能说这么多
- We gotta get out of here. - Oh, but here I am tantalizing you,

577
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,930
因为我发了誓不能说
when I swore I wouldn't tell.

578
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,220
你就告诉我吧
Just tell me.

579
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,140
尼克  对不起  我发过誓了
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry, I swore.

580
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,430
发了誓不能说的
I swore I wouldn't tell.

581
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,090
抱歉让她走了  老伙计
Sorry to keep her from you, old sport.

582
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,380
别忘了明天上午的水上滑艇之约
Don't forget we're going up in that hydroplane tomorrow morning.

583
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,110
一定
Yes.

584
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,510
盖茨比先生
Mr. Gatsby, sir.

585
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,160
-费城来电  -知道了
- Philadelphia on the phone. - Yes.

586
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,000
晚安  老伙计
Night, old sport.

587
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,830
晚安
Good night.

588
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,120
谢谢你
Thank you.

589
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,760
怎么了
What's the matter?

590
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,380
没油了吗
You run out of gas?

591
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,200
尼克  要来看我哦
Nick! Come and see me!

592
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,020
下周一起喝茶
We'll have tea next week.

593
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,630
电话簿上找
I'm in the phone book.

594
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,430
我会给你打电话的
I'll call you up.

595
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,350
后来我们去坐了水上滑艇
Well, we rode in the hydroplane.

596
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,430
我又参加了两次他的派对
And I attended two more of his parties.

597
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,060
还借用过他家沙滩
Even made use of his beach.

598
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,560
但老实说  医生
But you know, doctor, I realized

599
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,690
我完全不了解盖茨比这个人
that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all.

600
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,190
直到后来...
Until...

601
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,530
车还不错吧  老伙计
It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?

602
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,920
以前是不是没见过
Haven't you ever seen it before?

603
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,700
专门定制的
It's all a custom job.

604
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,450
增压引擎
Supercharged engine.

605
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,350
快去穿衣服
Get dressed.

606
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,180
跟我去吃饭
We're going to lunch.

607
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
我说  老伙计
Look here, old sport.

608
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,710
你觉得我这人怎么样
What is your opinion of me, anyhow?

609
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,000
-我觉得吗  -对  你怎么想的
- My opinion? - Yes, yes, your opinion.

610
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,390
我不希望
I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all these,

611
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,800
你被各种奇怪的谣言误导
from all these bizarre accusations you must be hearing.

612
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,510
那些全是假的  你听过吧
A pack of lies, I guarantee. You've heard the stories?

613
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,940
-我...  -我会告诉你真相的
- Well, I... - I will tell you God's truth.

614
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,410
不掺一点假

615
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,800
我出身于中西部的有钱人家

616
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,430
不幸的是  家人都已去世
Sadly, all of them are dead now.

617
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,240
我虽在美国长大  却在牛津上学
I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford.

618
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,020
因为祖祖辈辈都在那里接受教育
Because all my ancestors have been educated there for years.

619
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,190
算是家族传统吧
You see, it's a family tradition.

620
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,280
他说话的方式
The way he spoke.

621
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,860
的确会让人怀疑他在说谎
No wonder people thought he was lying.

622
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,870
家人去世后  我得到了巨额遗产
After my family died, I ran into a great deal of money.

623
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,720
此后我就像王子一般
After that, I lived like a young prince.

624
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,990
游历欧洲各国
You know, in all the capitals of Europe.

625
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,500
-欧洲啊  -对  是欧洲
- Oh, Europe. - Yes, Europe.

631
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,210
以红宝石为主
chiefly rubies.

632
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,130
狩猎猛兽
Hunting big game,

633
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,530
画了几幅画  做些我想做的事
painting a little, things for myself only.

634
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,180
试图忘记忧愁...
Trying to forget something sad...

635
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,970
我本以为这些就够带劲的了
Just when I thought it couldn't be any more fantastical.

636
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,840
战争打响了  老伙计
Then came the war, old sport.

637
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,890
他化身战争英雄  单枪匹马拿下了德军
He became a war hero, single-handedly defeating the German army.

638
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,150
在阿尔贡的森林里
In the Argonne Forest,

639
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,230
我攻破两个机枪支队
I took two machine gun detachments so far...

640
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,980
当时敌众我寡  只能以一敌五
We were outnumbered 5 to 1.

641
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,480
那有个半英里深的峡谷
There was a half a mile gap.

642
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,780
德军全军覆没
There wasn't a single German soldier left standing.

643
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,280
我们在峡谷里呆了两天两夜
We stayed there two days and two nights.

644
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,280
看到横尸遍野
We saw piles of dead.

645
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,490
130个士兵只有16把刘易斯式机关枪
One hundred and thirty men with only 16 Lewis guns.

646
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
所有同盟国都颁发给我一枚勋章
Every Allied government gave me a medal.

647
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,660
连黑山共和国也不例外
Even Montenegro.

648
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,660
位于前南斯拉夫南部  亚德里沿岸地区

649
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,000
看
Here.

650
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,710
这个就是
That's from Montenegro.

651
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,790
"杰·盖茨比少校
"Major Jay Gatsby for

652
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,340
-骁勇善战  特授予勋章"  -没错
- valor extraordinary." - Valor extraordinary. That's right.

653
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,580
这个我一直随身携带
And this is something I always carry with me,

654
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,760
来纪念我在牛津大学的时光
a souvenir of Oxford days.

655
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,710
这是在三一学院照的  
That was taken in Trinity quad.

656
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,450
左边的人现在是唐卡斯特伯爵
The man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.

657
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,080
我还有什么可说的呢
What could I say?

658
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,890
照片毋庸置疑是真的
The photograph was undoubtedly authentic.

659
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,100
但这些都是真的吗
Could it all be true?

660
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,150
当然  你大可不必听信我  老伙计
Of course, you don't need to take my word for it, old sport.

661
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,090
午宴时我会介绍个人给你认识
At lunch, I'm going to introduce you

A Mr. Meyer Wolfshiem, my good friend.

664
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,160
此人现实中原型即是1919年黑袜丑闻的主角阿诺德·罗斯坦，美剧《大西洋帝国》中亦有该角色

665
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,870
他会证实我说的一切
He will confirm all I have told you

666
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,370
-并为我的人格做担保  -不用了
- and vouch for my good character. - I am sure that's not necessary.

667
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,790
不  有这个必要
Oh, but it is, though.

668
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,950
我觉得你应该了解下我的生活
I thought you ought to know something about my life.

669
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,120
我不想让你认为我是个
I didn't want you to think I was,

670
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,500
好吧
well,

671
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,420
我不想让你认为我是个无名小卒
I didn't want you to think I was some nobody.

672
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,960
老伙计
You see, old sport,

673
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,220
我今天想向你提个不情之请
I'm going to make a very big request of you today.

674
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,930
不情之请
A big request?

675
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,930
没错
Yes.

676
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,930
你带贝克小姐去喝茶时
Miss Baker will explain everything

677
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,260
她会详细解释给你
when you take her to tea.

678
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,140
乔丹  跟她有什么关系
Jordan? What's she got to do with it?

679
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,100
我保证这绝对是合法正当的
Well, I assure you it's nothing underhand.

680
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,310
贝克小姐是个诚实的运动员
Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman.

681
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,480
她不会做错事的
She wouldn't do anything that wasn't all right.

682
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,150
靠边停车
Pull over!

683
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,650
-靠边停车  -好的  老伙计  好的
- Pull over to the curb! - All right, old sport. All right.

684
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,550
杰·盖茨比

685
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,870
果然是
Right you are!

686
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,040
下次不会麻烦您了  盖茨比先生
I'll know you next time, Mr. Gatsby!

687
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,500
-抱歉了  -谢谢你
- Excuse me. - Thank you.

688
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,670
你以前牛津的同学吗
One of your old Oxford pals?

689
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,340
我以前帮过警察局长一次
Well, I was able to do the commissioner a favor once.

690
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,380
他每年都给我寄圣诞贺卡
He sends me a Christmas card every year.

691
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,140
他应该也去那吃午饭
I imagine he'll be at lunch too. Heh.

692
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,440
车开上桥后  我变得无比困惑
By the time we reached the bridge, I was impossibly confused.

693
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,160
我不知道该想些什么
I didn't know what to think.

694
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,580
但从皇后大桥上放眼望去
But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge,

695
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,870
这个城市还是只如初见
is always the city seen for the first time

696
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,920
让你觉得世间所有美景
in its first wild promise of all the mystery

697
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,130
还有秘密
and the beauty

698
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,130
都在这里
in the world.

699
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,310
我想
Anything can happen

700
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,260
既然过了桥  就一切皆有可能了
now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought.

701
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,560
一切
Anything at all.

702
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,100
盖茨比都已经是我朋友了
Even Gatsby could happen.

703
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,230
可以  不错
Yes, absolutely.

704
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,820
小子
My boy!

705
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,200
迈耶  迈耶  迈耶

706
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,450
你身上味道不错
Mm. Smell so good.

707
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,870
-你看着挺不错的  -你不也是
- Look at you! - Look at you.

你的事我可都知道
I know all about you.

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,210
-这样啊  -没错  盖茨比先生
- I see. - Yes! Mr. Gatsby's

714
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,790
-总是提起您  -是吗
- always talking about you. - Really?

715
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,500
我们走吧
Shall we?

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,550
来吧
Come.

717
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,550

和像您这样的朋友待在一起时
With a friend with someone like you,

769
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,670
他都不会多看你妻子一眼
he'd never so much as look at your wife.

演员吗
An actor?

787
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:48,870
迈耶吗
Meyer?

788
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,040
不  他是个赌徒
No, no. He's a gambler.

是他平息了1919年的"黑袜丑闻"
He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.

他是怎么做到的
Well, how'd he manage that?

794
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,600
大概是瞅准了时机吧
Saw the opportunity, I suppose.

795
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,010
他是个精明的人
He's a very smart man.

796
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,150
老伙计  我想谈下有关贝克小姐

盖茨比先生  这位是布坎南先生

没想到在这能碰见你
Never would have expected to find you in this temple of virtue.

806
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,910
我来和盖茨比先生共进午餐
I was having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.

807

终于找到你了
There you are.

812
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
你和盖茨比在耍什么把戏
What game are you and Gatsby Playing at?

813
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,490
-这位先生是客人吗  -请等一下
- The gentleman will be joining? - Excuse me. One moment.

814
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,820

他开豪车来接我
He picks me up in his fancy car.

816
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,750
-开始向我讲述他的人生  -小声点

为什么
Why?

823
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
我不知从何讲起
I don't quite know where to start.

824
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,160
我碰到盖茨比先生的那晚
You see, I didn't realize

825
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,500
我才知道一切
until the other night that I'd met Gatsby.

826
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,690
五年前  在路易斯维尔[美国城市]

那天  我买了新的英式高尔夫鞋
It was the day I got my new English golf shoes.

其中一位军官和她同坐在车里
One of them was in the car with her.

832
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,750
他就是盖茨比
It was Gatsby.

833
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,750
他那深情款款的双眼
The way he looked at her is the way

834
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,710
是所有姑娘梦寐以求的
all girls want to be looked at.

835
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,750
给我讲讲这件事吧
So, tell me what happened.

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,460
我也不知道
Well, I don't know.

837
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,720
冲啊
Charge!

838
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,800
盖茨比被派去了战场
Gatsby was sent off to war.

When the war ended

但不知为何  盖茨比没回来
But for some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn't return.

842
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,930
钻石王老五  铁路之王得路易斯维尔美人芳心

843
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,000
一年后
A year later,

844
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,440
芝加哥的汤姆·布坎南横刀夺爱
Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away.

黛西收到了一封信
Daisy received a letter.

848
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,580
告诉他们黛西改主意了
Tell them Daisy's changed her mind!

849
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,920
-这是怎么回事  -黛西  别这样

-给我  -不

851
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,040
离我远点
Leave me alone!

852
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,340
乔丹  这事谁都不能知道
Jordan, no one must know about this.

853
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,250
-信里说了什么  -我不知道
- What was in the letter? - I don't know.

854
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,050
她不肯告诉我
She wouldn't tell me.

855
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,880
但一切都太晚了
But it was too late.

856

862
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,690
蜜月后  我在圣巴巴拉见过他们
After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara.

863
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,460
相当感人  真的
Well, it was touching, really.

864
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,070
我从没见过感情这么深的夫妻

一周以后  汤姆出了车祸

车上还有个圣巴巴拉酒店女服务员

所有的报纸都报道了
It got into all the papers.

868
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,540
-真是太巧了  -什么太巧了
- It's a strange coincidence. - What is?

869
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,630
盖茨比的房子和他们家就一水之隔
The fact that Gatsby's house is just across the bay.

870
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,840
这绝非巧合
It's no coincidence.

871
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,050
他买下那房子  就是为了接近她
He bought that house to be near her.

872
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,680
他办那些派对  就是希望她能来一次
He threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night.

873
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,800
他常常问起黛西
He constantly asked about Daisy.

874
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,310
只不过我先知道的这段历史
I was just the first person that knew her.

875
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,060
为一个五年没见的姑娘做了这一切
All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years.

876
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,940
现在却只要我请她来喝茶
And now he just wants me to invite her over to tea.

877
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,400
厚积薄发
The modesty of it.

878
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,470
真是难以置信  是吧
Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it?

879
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,220
晚上好  亲爱的
Evening, sweethearts.

880
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,780
去哪儿呢  孩子们
Where are you kids going?

881
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,180
-长岛吧  -你说我要不要...
- Long Island, please. - And you think I should...

882
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,370
我是说  黛西会想见盖茨比吗
I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?

883
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,120
绝对不能让她知道
She's absolutely not to know.

884
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,040
你把她请过来就好
You're supposed to invite her over

885
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,710
他就可以假装路过
so he can happen to pass by.

886
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,130
我记得我内心很纠结
I remember feeling torn.

887
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,130
把我已婚的表妹黛西和我不熟悉的男人
Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman

888
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,050
撮合在一起  合适吗
together with a man I hardly knew?

889
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:21,310
我回到家时  盖茨比家灯火通明
When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit from tower to cellar

890
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,940
好像又一场狂欢
as if for another wild party.

891
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,360
但却没有一丝声响
But there wasn't a sound.

892
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,540
-谢谢你  -晚上愉快
- Thank you. - Have a good night.

893
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,270
你家就像世界博览会  或者科尼岛
Your place looks like the World's Fair or Coney Island.

894
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,270
科尼岛  纽约布鲁克林南部娱乐中心

895
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,230
-是吗  -是的
- Does it? - Yes.

896
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,320
我只是随便看看这些屋子
Well, I've just been glancing into some of the rooms.

897
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,550
你说我们去科尼岛怎么样  老伙计
What do you say we go to Coney Island, old sport?

898
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,690
可以坐我的车去
We could take my car.

899
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,900
今天太晚了
Oh, uh, it's too late tonight.

900
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,490
那我们可以跳进泳池凉快凉快
We could take a plunge in the swimming pool.

901
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,910
我整个夏天都还没用过它
I haven't made use of it all summer.

902
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,530
我得去睡觉了
I must go to bed.

903
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,790
那好
All right.

904
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,000
我很乐意
Happy to do it.

905
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,840
我会给黛西打电话
I'm going to call Daisy and

906
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,010
-请她来喝茶的  -太好了
- invite her to tea. - That's all right.

907
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,010
-你觉得哪天方便  -你觉得哪天方便
- What day would suit you? - What day would suit you?

908
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,050
我可不想给你添麻烦
I don't want to put you to any trouble.

909
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,600
后天怎么样
Day after tomorrow all right?

910
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,930
后天吗
Day after tomorrow?

911
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,770
我  我想
Well, I, I'd,

912
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,310
我得找人修一下草坪
See, I'd want to get the grass cut.

913
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,610
听我说  老伙计
Well, look here, old sport.

914
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,410
你赚的钱不多吧  对吗
You don't make much money, do you?

915
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,620
-不太多  -恕我冒昧
- Not really. - If you'll forgive me.

916
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,000
我正好在做一点小生意
You see, I happen to run a little business on the side.

917
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,540
相当于副业
A sort of sideline.

918
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,450
你知道我在说什么  对吧
You understand what I'm saying, right?

919
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,830
你是卖债券的  是吧  老伙计
You do sell bonds, don't you, old sport?

920
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,130
-我正在努力卖  -好的
- I'm trying to. - Right.

921
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,090
干这个  可是要相当的保密
Well, happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing

922
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,720
不过钱倒是不少
but you might make a nice bit of money on the side.

923
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,410
不用了  谢谢你  我太忙了
No, thank you. I have my hands full.

924
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,890
你不用和沃尔夫山姆有任何来往
You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem,

925
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,540
我保证
I assure you.

926
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,470
举手之劳  杰  举手之劳而已
It's a favor, Jay. Just a favor.

927
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,520
真的  我很乐意帮忙
Yes. Happy to do it.

928
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,690
-举手之劳  -是的
- Favor? - Yes.

929
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,650
那好  晚安
Well, good night.

930
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,450
晚安
Good night.

931
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,300
早上好
Good morning.

932
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,450
有份报纸说  雨大概四点会停
One of the papers says they thought the rain would stop about 4.

933
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,040
我想那是...我想那是《新闻报》
I think it was the... I think it was the Journal.

934
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,580
进门右拐  先生们
Just in to the right, gentlemen.

935
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,720
右拐  放在客厅里  谢谢大家
To the right in the living room. Thank you.

936
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,970
一切还好吗
Is everything all right?

937
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,070
草看起来很好  如果你问的是这个
The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean.

938
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:48,560
草
Grass?

939
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,060
什么草
What grass?

940
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,150
我买了蛋糕
I bought cakes.

941
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,200
你有...
Have you...

942
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,660
你需要的东西都有了吗
Have you got everything you need?

943
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,620
可能花多了点
Perhaps more flowers.

944
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,880
我觉得他们干得很不错  你说呢
I think they did a fine job, don't you?

945
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,340
很漂亮
Beautiful.

946
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,300
是不是太多了
You think it's too much?

947
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,470
这正是你想要的
Uh, I think it's what you want.

948
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,760
我也这么觉得
I think so too.

949
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,790
我不能一直等着
I can't wait all day.

950
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,290
我要走了
I'm leaving.

951
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,250
别傻了  再过两分钟就四点了
Don't be silly. It's two minutes to 4.

952
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,790
没有人会来喝茶的  这太...
No one's coming to tea! It's too...

953
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,260
是她来了
It's her!

954
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,150
这真是你住的地方吗  亲爱的
Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?

955
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,280
是的  这很合我胃口
Yes, it suits me.

956
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,590
为什么让我一个人来
Why did I have to come alone?

957
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,820
你爱上我了吗
Are you in love with me?

958
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,120
这是卡罗威城堡的秘密
Oh, it's the secret of Carraway Castle.

959
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,260
让你的司机去兜个大圈
Tell your chauffeur to go far away.

960
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,410
一小时后再回来  费尔迪
Come back in an hour Ferdie.

961
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,960
他叫费尔迪
His name is Ferdie.

962
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,600
我的天啊
Oh. My goodness.

963
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,140
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

964
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,100
你...你抢劫花房了吗
You... did you ransack a greenhouse?

965
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,230
这家伙真是爱上我了
He is in love with me.

966
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,040
劳驾
Would you?

967
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,000
真有趣
That's funny.

968
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,500
什么真有趣
What's funny?

969
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,470
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

970
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,400
我非常高兴能再次见你
I'm certainly glad to see you again.

971
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,490

00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,310
我们见过面
We've met before.

我马上找人来修
I'll have someone come repair this immediately.

976
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,050
抱歉弄坏了你的钟
Sorry about the clock.

977
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,720
-那钟很老了  -但很漂亮

978

我们好几年没见了
We haven't met for many years.

980

到十一月  就满五年了
Five years next November.

981
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:41,810
喝茶吗
Tea?

982
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,940
-谢谢  老伙计  -谢谢  亲爱的
- Yes, thank you, old sport. - Darling, thank you.

983
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:45,770
-柠檬还是糖  -都不用
- Lemon or sugar? - Neither.

984
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,530
都不加  谢谢你
Plain. Thank you.

985
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,840
我得去一趟城里
I just have to pop into town

986
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,380
-城里  -马上就回来
- Town? - I'll be right back.

987
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,470
尼克  我有话要和你说
Nick, I've gotta speak to you about something.

988
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,180
-好的  我马上回来  -老天
- Yes. I'll be right back. - God.

989
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,010
这是个错误  这是个巨大的错误
This was a mistake. This was a terrible, terrible mistake.

990
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,930
你只是有些紧张了  黛西也是
You're just embarrassed. Daisy's embarrassed too.

991
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,440
-她也紧张吗  -是的
- She's embarrassed? - Yes.

992
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,400
就和你一样
Just as much as you are.

993
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,860
别这么大声
Don't talk so loud.

994
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,950
你别这么不成熟  太失礼了
You're acting like a little boy. You're being rude.

995
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,860
黛西一个人在里面  而你...
Daisy's in there all alone and you're...

996
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,810
看看我写下的部分
Looking over my story so far

997
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,320
我想起  那是我在那年夏天  第二次
I'm reminded that for the second time that summer

998
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,610
为别人保守秘密了
I was guarding other people's secrets.

999
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,870
再一次地  我既置身事内
Once again, I was within

1000
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,200
又超乎其外
and without.

1001
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,980
雨停了
It's stopped raining.

1002
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,950
是啊
Yes.

1003
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,780
雨真的停了
It has, hasn't it?

1004
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,090
你觉得那怎么样  黛西
What do you think of that, Daisy?

1005
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,380
过来看看
Come look.

1006
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,010
尼克  真有意思
Oh, Nicky. How funny.

1007
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,850
瞧啊  那是我家
Look, it's my house.

1008
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:28,850
就在对岸
Just there across the bay.

1009
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,360
我知道
I know.

1010
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,610
从我家也能看到这番景致
I have the same view from my place.

1011
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,330
你家在哪
Where's your place?

1012
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,890
尼克  我想请你和黛西都到我家来
Nick, I want you and Daisy both to come over to my house.

1013
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,210
我想带她转转
I'd like to show her around.

1014
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,880
你确定要我一起来吗
You sure you want me to come?

1015
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,260
当然了  老伙计
Absolutely, old sport.

1016
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,380
当然了
Absolutely.

1017
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,340
拉德纳  把大门打开
Ladner, open the gates.

1018
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,550
把大门打开
Open the gates!

1019
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,860
这大门是诺曼底一座城堡里的
I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy.

黛西  黛西  亲爱的  怎么了

1080
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,490

Because...

1081
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,870
那迷失的五年  在黛西唇边徘徊
Five lost years struggled on Daisy's lips.

1082
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,000
她却只说出

1083
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,750
为什么
Why?

1084
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,720
因为我从没见过这么漂亮的衣服
Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before.

1085
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,610
要不是有雾
If it wasn't for the mist

1086
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,490
我们就能看见绿光了

1088
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,800
你家码头彻夜闪烁的绿光
The one that burns all night at the end of your dock.

1089
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:12,090
或许  盖茨比意识到了

1090
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,510
那道绿光的象征意义
the colossal significance of that light

1091
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,770
已经不复存在了
had vanished forever.

1092
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,980
现在它不过是码头上的一道绿光而已
Now it was once again just a green light on a dock.

1093
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,570
他为之着魔的东西少了一样
And his count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.

1094
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,110
这是谁

01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,700
-你父亲吗  -不是

那是丹·科迪先生  老伙计

1097
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,410
他已经去世了

1098
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,040
很多年前  他是我最好的朋友

01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,930
你从没告诉我你剪过庞帕多发型
You never told me you had a pompadour.

1100
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:40,910
还有过一艘游艇
Or a yacht.

1101
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,830
我要给你看个东西
I wanna show you something.

1102
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,250

1103

这是我弄到的第一张你的照片

01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,400
我们不能失去彼此
We can't lose each other

1109
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,690
不能让这华丽的爱落得一场空
and let all this glorious love end in nothing.

1110
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,610
快回家吧
Come home.

1111
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,520

每一个有你在的美梦都成真
for every long dream of you to come true.

1114
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,200
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1115
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,480
先生  斯莱格尔在底特律来电
Sir, Slagle's in Detroit.

1116
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,380
我现在不方便说话  老伙计
I can't talk now, old sport.

1117
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:37,550
他必须知道小镇是什么样
He must know what a small town is.

1118
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,890
不  你给我听着  给我听着
No, you listen to me. Listen to me.

1119
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,600
我说了  是个小镇
I said a small town.

1120
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,610
他得知道小镇是什么样
He must know what a small town is.

1121
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,740
听我说  他要是以为底特律是个小镇
Listen to me, he's of no use to us if Detroit is his idea

1122
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,870
就对我们没用处了  你明白吗
of a small town, you understand?

1123
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,540
我们换个时间聊  老伙计
We'll chat later, old sport.

1124
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,090
好的
All right.

真希望一直这样

1131
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,260
会的
It will be.

1132
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:46,830
真希望抱着黛西  就让盖茨比满足了
If only it had been enough for Gatsby just to hold Daisy.

1133
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,560
但他对他和黛西的人生有个宏大的计划
But he had a grand vision for his life and Daisy's part in it.

1134
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,900
直到那个夏末
It wasn't until the end of that summer

1135
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:00,450
我最后一次见到盖茨比
on the last night I saw Gatsby

1136
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,990
他才告诉我
that he told me of

1137
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,790
他小时候对未来生活的憧憬
the life he had dreamed for himself since he was a boy.

1138
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:07,540
你知道吗  医生
You see, doctor

1139
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,960

詹姆斯·盖茨

1141
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,880
他的父母是北达科他州身无分文的农民

1142
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,550
但他从不认他们为自己的父母

1143
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,180
在自己的想象中  他是上帝之子
In his own imagination, he was a son of God,

1144
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,440
注定成就伟业
destined for future glory.

1145
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,200
为追随命运

1146
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,570
十六岁的盖茨远走他乡
a 16-year-old Gatz ran far, far away.

一天下午  在苏必利尔湖的岸边
One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior,

1148
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,280
他看见一艘游艇处于险境

他奋力划行  拯救了那游艇和它的主人

1150
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,910
酒鬼富豪  丹·科迪

1151
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,160
船在哪儿
Where's the boat?

1152

你要撞上浅滩了
You're gonna hit the shoal!

1153
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,250
先生  我们要撞上浅滩了
Come on, sir! We're gonna hit the shoal!

1154
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,500
你他妈的在干嘛
What the hell are you doing,

1155
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,340
老伙计
old sport?

1156
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,090
这就是他的机会  他抓住了
This was his opportunity and he seized it.

1157
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,430
就在那时  我决定改名叫杰·盖茨比
And I decided right then and there to call myself Jay Gatsby.

1158
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,520
他开着游艇驶离了危险  也驶向了未来
He sailed the yacht out of danger and into his future.

1159
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,690
富豪看到了他的技巧和雄心
Gatsby showed skill and ambition.

1160
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,520
五年里  他们航遍了世界

1161
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,190
他很不错  老丹
He was all right, old Dan.

1162
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:20,990
他什么都教我

如何像绅士一般打扮  谈吐  做事

1164
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,320

1165
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,200
这船状况很好  不是吗
She looks well, doesn't she,

1166
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,370
盖茨比希望能继承科迪的财产
Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune.

1167
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,580
-老伙计  -但科迪死后

1168
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,500
科迪的家人骗去本该由盖茨比继承的部分
Gatsby was cheated of his inheritance by Cody's family.

1169
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,920
他表面上还能继续扮绅士
He'd been left with the ability to play the gentleman,

1170
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:42,510
但实际上  他又一次身无分文了
but he was once again dirt-poor.

1171
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:46,140
盖茨比的惊人财富  钱  钱  钱  还是钱

1172
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,630

盖茨比投资摩天大楼  "投资我们的未来"

1175
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,260
杰什么钱都出得起  派对  晚宴  公园  学校  图书馆  华尔街之王算什么  来见见杰·盖茨比玩转证券市场  屡战屡胜

1176
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:58,550
钱究竟从何而来  盖茨比  神秘百万财富引漫天传言

By midsummer,

盖茨比成了头版新闻
Gatsby was front page news.

1179
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,990
他的钱从何而来
Where did the money come from?

1180
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,420
这是整个纽约都想知道的
That's what all of New York wanted to know.

1181
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,840
汤姆陪黛西参加盖茨比的一个豪华派对时
And it was the same question on Tom's mind

1182

盖茨比离开

但是盖茨比没能回来

1302
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,500
搞这动物园样的聚会

1303

我想知道他是谁  他想干什么

1313

1318
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,650
离她很远

1319

很难使她理解
It's so hard to make her understand.

1320
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,160
你是说舞会吗
You mean about the party?

1321
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,330
舞会
The party?

1322
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,040
我根本不关心什么舞会
I couldn't care less about the parties.

1323
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,870
舞会结束了  先生们
That'll be all for now, gentlemen.

1324
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,500
-谢谢  -谢谢  先生
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

1325
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,000
你瞧
You see

1326
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,420
她得去告诉汤姆她没爱过他
she has to tell Tom that she never loved him.

1327
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,420
什么
What?

1328
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:09,760
是的
Yes.

1329
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,970
然后我们就回路易斯维尔  她父母家
Then we can go back to Louisville to her parents' house.

1330
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,770
她父母很友善  老伙计
Her parents are lovely people, old sport. We'll be

1331
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,930
我们就在那结婚
married there.

1332
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,140
你看
See...

1333
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:22,130
我和黛西会重新开始
See, Daisy and I are gonna

1334
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:24,400
就像五年前那样
start over just as if it were five years ago.

1335
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,150
我不能对她要求太多
I wouldn't ask too much of her.

1336
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,610
要求太多
Wouldn't ask too much?

1337
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,820
不
No.

1338
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,330
抱歉  老伙计  我很
I beg your pardon, old sport. It's just--

1339
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,410
我很难过  因为很难使她
It's so sad, because it's so hard to make her

1340
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,250
理解
understand.

1341
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,460
很难使她理解
It's so hard to make her understand.

1342
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,410
我为她建造了这一切
I've gotten all these things for her,

1343
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,010
现在她居然想逃离
and now she just wants to run away.

1344
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,130
她甚至想
She even wants

1345
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,840
-逃离这些  -杰
- to leave that. - Jay.

1346
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,260
你不能重复过去
You can't repeat the past.

1347
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,560
不能重复过去
Can't repeat the past?

1348
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:01,020
不
No.

1349
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,190
为什么  你当然能
Why, of course you can.

1350
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,570
你当然能
Of course you can.

1351
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,030
我要把这些
I'm gonna fix things

1352
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:11,070
修复得和过去一样
just the way they were before.

1353
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:16,240
从那以后  一切都变得不对劲  我
Everything's been so confused since then. I

1354
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:20,040
他滔滔不绝大谈往事
He talked a lot about the past

1355
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,620
好似想要恢复什么
as if he wanted to recover something.

1356
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:28,050
如果我能回到起点
If I could just get back to the start,

1357
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,720
如果我能回到起点
if I could just get back to the start

1358
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,890
我能再次发现它
I could find it again.

1359
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,640
他深爱着黛西的
Some vision

1360
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,600
一些记忆
of himself that he had put into loving Daisy.

1361
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:44,560
五年前  路易斯维尔的一个夜晚
One night in Louisville, five years ago

1362
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:50,070
阴差阳错  盖茨比去了黛西家
Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident.

1363
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,790
我去她家
I went to her house

1364
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:54,160
是和泰勒营的其他军官一起去的
first with some of the officers from Camp Taylor.

1365
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,530
我从未到过如此漂亮的房子
I'd never been in such a beautiful house.

1366
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,200
一起跳下一支舞可以吗
May I save the next dance?

1367
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:59,910
他的制服掩藏着
His uniform hid

1368
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,620
一个事实
the truth that he was

1369
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,250
他是个只有
a penniless young man

1370
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:04,920
雄心壮志的
with only that

1371
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,250
穷小子
grand vision of himself.

1372
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,380
-黛西  别走  -我没有  母亲
- Daisy, don't scamper. - I was not, Mother.

1373
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,670
这么多意气风发的年轻军官在这儿
So many dashing young officers here.

1374
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,220
而且他们家世显赫
And from such illustrious families.

1375
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,890
我知道我能往上爬
I always knew that I could climb.

1376
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,390
但只能
But I could only climb

1377
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:20,930
独自往上爬
if I climbed alone.

1378
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:24,940
我知道
I knew

1379
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,690
当我吻
that when I

1380
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,900
这个姑娘的时候
kissed this girl

1381
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:31,360
我就和她
I would be

1382
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,530
永结连理了
forever wed to her.

1383
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,530
于是我停下来
So I stopped.

1384
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,450
我停下来
I stopped and I

1385
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,830
等待
I waited.

1386
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:47,960
等待了
I waited

1387
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,880
一会儿
for a moment longer.

1388
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,340
他知道
He knew

1389
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:56,470
他的心灵再也不会像上帝的心灵一样
his mind would never again be free to romp like...

1390
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,640
自由驰骋了
the mind of God.

1391
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,180
坠入爱河
That falling in love

1392
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,600
永远地改变了他的
would change his destiny

1393
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,980
命运
forever.

1394
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,610
然后我就放任了自己
And then I just let myself go.

1395
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,330
她像花一样为他绽放
She blossomed for him like a flower

1396
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,290
他们水乳交融
and the incarnation was complete.

1397
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:46,270
我知道我这样的男人坠入爱河是天大的错
I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love.

1398
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,950
我才32岁  如果我能忘记失去过黛西
I'm only 32. I might still

1399
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,230
我仍然可以成为一个了不起的人
be a great man if I could forget that I once

1400
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,860
但是
lost Daisy, but

1401
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,400
我的人生  老伙计  我的人生
my life, old sport, my life

1402
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,900
我的人生必须这样
My life has got to be like this.

1403
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,580
必须这么做
It's got to keep going up.

1404
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,840
她得去找汤姆
She has to go to Tom

1405
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,420
告诉他  她从未爱过他
and tell him that she never loved him.

1406
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:24,220
我得给她多一点时间  老伙计
I just need to give her more time, old sport.

1407
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,930
多一点时间
More time.

1408
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:34,980
别担心  老伙计  别担心
Don't worry, old sport. Don't worry.

1409
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,070
在这儿我能保护她
I can protect her here.

1410
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,030
晚安  老伙计
Good night, old sport.

1411
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,870
我能回到过去  老伙计
You're wrong about the past, old sport.

1412
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,670
你错了
You're wrong.

1413
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,990
从我邻居家里传来的音乐
There had been music from my neighbor's

1414
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,160
持续了整个夏天
all summer.

1415
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,160
在他的蓝色花园里  男男女女如飞蛾扑火般
In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths

1416
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:30,000
在星空下窃窃私语着  欢笑着
among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars.

1417
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,750
早餐来了
Breakfast.

1418
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:32,920
好的
Yes.

1419
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,670
多谢  多谢
Thank you, thank you.

1420
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,920
欢笑
Laughter.

1421
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,090
多谢
Thank you.

1422
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:43,550
不  是在星空下窃窃私语  喝着香槟
No. The whisperings and the champagne and the stars.

1423
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,140
但是
But

1424
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,940
派对宫殿暗夜到来

1425
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:50,270
汤姆和黛西的来访之后
after Tom and Daisy's visit

1426
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,150
盖茨比家的灯一盏一盏的熄了
Gatsby's lights went out one by one.

1427
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,940
没有聚会了
There were no more parties.

1428
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,610
黛西悄悄前来
Daisy visited discreetly.

1429
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,030
杰·盖茨比这响亮的名头
For the very same fame that had all summer

1430
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,750
虽曾让他满足
been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby

1431
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,250
现在却也成了威胁
had become a threat.

1432
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,250
那神秘的女人是谁

1433
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,820
我不想回家
I don't wanna go home.

1434
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,700
我听说你辞退了所有佣人
I hear you fired all your servants.

1435
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:54,960
黛西有时下午来
Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoon.

1436
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,090
我希望人们在我们决定怎么做之前
I wanted people who wouldn't

1437
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,340
不要说长道短
gossip until we decide what we're going to do.

1438
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,960
周边这些市镇
You see, these towns

1439
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,300
非常紧密  老伙计
are very close together, old sport

1440
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,930
上报纸很正常
and, well, it gets in the papers, you understand.

1441
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,890
那些都是沃尔夫山姆想帮忙的人
They're all people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.

1442
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,640
只要他们会做饭会铺床叠被
What's the difference as long as they can cook

1443
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:14,930
又有什么区别呢  是吧
and make beds, right?

1444
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,060
尼克
Nick

1445
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:22,780
黛西准备好了  她准备好了
Daisy's ready. She's ready.

1446
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,690
还有一件事
There's just one thing.

1447
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,730
她想邀请你和贝克小姐
She's requested that you and

1448
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:30,200
明天去她家吃午饭
Miss Baker be there for lunch tomorrow at her house.

1449
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,450
你会来吗  老伙计
Will you come, old sport?

1450
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,040
黛西需要你
Daisy needs you.

1451
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,420
我去
I'll.

1452
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,500
我们需要你
We need you.

1453
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,260
你能来吗  老伙计
Can you come, old sport?

1454
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,280
我在哪里读到说
You know, I read somewhere

1455
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,280
天气一年比一年热
that the sun is getting hotter every year.

1456
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,540
等等
Wait a minute.

1457
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,370
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

1458
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:17,870
天气一年比一年
Sun is getting colder

1459
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,290
冷
every year.

1460
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,420
今天我真想
Oh, I would like to be out

1461
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,170
去海湾啊
on that bay today.

1462
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,220
我住你对面
I'm right across from you.

1463
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,890
那边
Right there.

1464
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,100
果然是
So you are.

1465
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,570
其实
You see

1466
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:49,740
每一夜
every night

1467
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,070
我都能看到
I can see

1468
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,320
你码头尽头
that light

1469
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:55,700
闪烁的灯
at the end of your dock blinking.

1470
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,410
什么灯
What light?

1471
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:07,920
布坎南先生
You see, Mr. Buchanan.

1472
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,050
我想近一点
I wanted to be close.

1473
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,220
-黛西和我都  -太热了
- Daisy and I have both-- - It's so hot!

1474
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:18,100
一切都
Everything's

1475
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,350
不对劲
so confused.

1476
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,020
我们下午干什么
What'll we do this afternoon

1477
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,770
明天干什么  后面30年干什么
or the day after that, or for the next 30 years?

1478
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,690
发什么疯啊
Oh, don't be morbid.

1479
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:27,360
我们进城去吧  谁想进城
Let's go to town. Who wants to go to town?

1480
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,190
进城
Town?

1481
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:31,360
女人总是有
Women get these

1482
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:32,280
这些小心思
notions.

1483
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,720
黛西
Daisy.

1484
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:59,850
你看上去真帅
You look so cool.

1485
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:05,350
你总是看上去那么帅
You always look so cool

1486
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,650
就像时代广场
...like the advertisement

1487
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,270
广告里的那个人
of the man in Times Square.

1488
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,150
那个人穿着
The man

1489
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,490
帅气漂亮的衬衫
in the cool, beautiful shirts.

1490
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:20,950
她告诉盖茨比
She had told

1491
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,410
她爱他
Gatsby that she loved him

1492
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:24,710
而汤姆
and Tom

1493
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:26,210
也都看到了
had seen.

1494
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,040
我们进城去吧
Let's go to town.

1495
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,130
求之不得呢
I'm perfectly willing.

1496
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,380
真是个不错的主意
It's a marvelous idea.

1497
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:32,380
亨利  备车
Henri! Have the car

1498
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:33,550
马上开过来
brought around now.

1499
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,880
我们不能
Can't anyone at least have

1500
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:36,840
-先抽支烟吗  -午饭时抽过了
- a cigarette first? - We smoked through lunch.

1501
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:38,450
别这样  找点儿乐子呗
Come on, let's have fun.

1502
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:39,890
这么热  别闹了
It's too hot to fuss.

1503
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,600
黛西  这是你提出来的呀
Daisy, it was your great idea.

1504
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,310
咱们一起去城里吧
Why don't we? Let's all go to town.

1505
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,890
我又改主意了  你个没良心的
I changed my mind, you brute.

1506
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:49,190
去吧  在广场饭店开个大房间
Come on. We'll get a great big room at the Plaza,

1507
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:54,150
喝着加冰威士忌  多享受啊
a bucket of ice, a bottle of whiskey, and it will be fun.

1508
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,320
走吧
Come on.

1509
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,990
这是你的主意呀
It was your idea.

1510
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,780
随你便吧  汤姆
Fine. Have it your own way, Tom.

1511
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,200
乔丹  咱们走
Come on, Jordan.

1512
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,630
盖茨比先生  你也来吗
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

1513
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,380
两瓶威士忌  用毛巾包好
Two bottles of whiskey. Wrap them in a towel.

1514
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,760
尼克  走啊
Come on, Nick!

1515
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,940
盖茨比先生  你能开我的轿车吗
Mr. Gatsby, would you be good enough to take my coupe,

1516
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,780
我用你的马戏团大篷车拉上其他人
and I'll drive everyone else in your circus wagon.

1517
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,770
汽油恐怕不多了  老伙计
I don't think there's much gas, old sport.

1518
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,230
汽油多得很
No, plenty of gas.

1519
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,820
假如没油了  我可以找一个杂货店
Well, if I run out, I'll stop at a drugstore.

1520
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,740
听说这年头杂货店什么都能买到
I hear you can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays.

1521
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:37,570
你载着尼克和乔丹
You take Nick and Jordan.

1522
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:42,080
-好啊  -咱们饭店见
- I suppose you can, yes. - We'll meet you at the Plaza.

1523
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,080
我肯定比你们先到
I'll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes!

1524
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,090
你们以为我是个蠢货  对吧
You must think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?

1525
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,010
但我有种直觉  它会告诉我该怎么办
Well, I have a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do.

1526
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,260
我小小的调查了一下这家伙
I've made a small investigation into this fellow.

1527
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,200
你发现他上过牛津大学
And you found he was an Oxford man?

1528
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,350
牛津  新墨西哥的牛津吧
Oxford, New Mexico.

1529
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:04,470
就凭他那身粉色套装
He wears a pink suit, for christ's sake.

1530
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,460
汤姆  咱们快没油了
Tom, we're almost out of gas.

1531
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,170
威尔逊
Wilson!

1532
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,470
威尔逊
Wilson!

1533
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,760
还等什么呢
What are you waiting for?

1534
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,760
快给我加点油
Let's have some gas!

1535
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,560
还要我自己动手吗
Do I have to do it myself?

1536
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:47,600
你以为我是来看风景的吗
You think I come here to admire the view?

1537
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:50,190
-不好意思  我病了  -为什么
- I'm sorry, I'm sick. - Why?

1538
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:53,020
-怎么回事  -我也不知道
- Why, what's the matter? - I don't know.

1539
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,310
我感觉很虚弱
I'm all run down.

1540
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,610
-我需要钱  非常需要  -啥
- I need money real bad. - What?

1541
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,490
我和我老婆要去西部了
My wife and I, we wanna go West.

1542
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,740
你老婆也想去吗
Your wife does?

1543
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:07,970
汤姆感到心乱如麻
Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.

1544
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:11,920
一小时前还尽在掌握的情妇和夫人
His mistress and wife an hour ago so secure

1545
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,670
却都要离他而去
were both slipping from his control.

1546
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:18,340
这两天我想通了一些有趣的事情
I wised up to something funny these last two days.

1547
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,720
不管她愿不愿意  她都要去
Yeah, she's going West whether she wants to or not.

1548
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,600
我欠你多少钱
What do I owe you?

1549
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,660
一块钱  一块二
A dollar. A dollar and twenty.

1550
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:28,930
我把那车给你了
You can have the car.

1551
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,270
明天我就送过来
I'll send it over tomorrow!

1552
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:26,780
好了  好了
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

1553
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,330
再开一扇窗户吧
Open another window.

1554
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,540
没有别的窗户了
There aren't any more.

1555
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,160
要把斧头自己砍一个
Then telephone for an ax.

1556
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:36,000
心静自然凉
Will you forget about the heat?

1557
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,090
你这样唠叨只会更热
You make it worse by crabbing about it.

1558
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,710
何不由着她来呢  老伙计
Why not let her alone, old sport?

1559
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,680
这是你的口头禅吗
That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?

1560
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,970
什么
What is?

1561
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:49,140
老伙计
"Old sport."

1562
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,640
你在哪学的
Where'd you pick it up?

1563
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,520
汤姆  如果你想要人身攻击
See here, Tom. If you're going to make personal remarks,

1564
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,390
我马上就走
I won't stay here a minute.

1565
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,400
盖茨比先生  听说你是牛津毕业生
Mr. Gatsby, I understand that you're an Oxford man.

1566
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,280
不  不完全是
No, not exactly, no.

1567
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,070
我知道你念过牛津
Oh, yes, I understand that you went to Oxford.

1568
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,300
是的  我念过
Well, yes, I went there.

1569
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:14,710
-这粉衣男居然还念过牛津  -汤姆
- Sure. The man in the pink suit went to Oxford. - Tom.

1570
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,460
我说了我念过
I said I went there, didn't I?

1571
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:18,790
我听到了
Oh, I heard you.

1572
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,040
我想知道是什么时候
I'd like to know when.

1573
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,420
你想知道是什么时候对吗
You'd like to know when.

1574
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,180
说呀  盖茨比先生
Well, Mr. Gatsby?

1575
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,730
那是1919年  我在那只待了五个月
It was in 1919. I only stayed there five months.

1576
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,610
所以我不自称牛津毕业生
That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man.

1577
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,090
他们为一些参战军官
You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of us officers

1578
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,200
提供了就读的机会
who fought in the war.

1579
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:54,120
我真想过去给他鼓鼓劲
I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back.

1580
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,370
我给你调杯酒吧  汤姆
I'll make you a drink, Tom.

1581
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,660
这样你就不会显得这么蠢
Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself.

1582
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:58,830
等等
Wait a minute.

1583
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,420
我还要问盖茨比先生一个问题
I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.

1584
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,260
请便  布坎南先生
Oh, please, please, go on, Mr. Buchanan. Go on.

1585
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,630
你想在我家闹多大的事
What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?

1586
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,460
他没有闹事  是你在闹事
He isn't causing a row, you're causing a row.

1587
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,180
管好你自己吧
Please have a little self-control.

1588
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,770
管好我自己
Self-control?

1589
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:20,840
是不是现在流行装聋作哑
Oh, I suppose the latest thing is to sit back

1590
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,230
任由不知道从哪出来的阿猫阿狗
and let Mr. Nobody From Nowhere

1591
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,900
跟你老婆上床
make love to your wife.

1592
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,940
你要是想谈这个  那我失陪了
Well, if that's the idea you can count me out.

1593
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:29,300
开始人们对家庭生活和家庭制度
See, nowadays people begin by sneering

1594
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,360
嗤之以鼻
at family life and family institutions

1595
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:35,060
接下来他们就该把所有传统抛之脑后
and the next you'll know, we'll throw everything overboard,

1596
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,950
要黑白通婚了
we'll have intermarriage between black and white!

1597
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,080
你老婆并不爱你
Your wife doesn't love you.

1598
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,050
她从来没爱过你
She never loved you.

1599
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,550
她爱的是我
You see, she loves me.

1600
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:53,430
你疯了吧
You must be crazy.

1601
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:55,720
没有  老伙计
No, old sport.

1602
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:59,270
她从没爱过你
No, you see, she never loved you.

1603
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,350
她嫁给你只是因为我很穷
She only married you because I was poor

1604
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,540
而她等不下去了
and she was tired of waiting.

1605
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:07,070
嫁给你是个大错误  可在她心中
It was a terrible terrible mistake, but in her heart,

1606
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:10,110
她从未爱过别人
in her heart, she never loved anyone but me.

1607
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,780
-我们走吧  -都回家吧
- We should go. - Let's all go home.

1608
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:14,050
黛西  坐下
Sit down, Daisy!

1609
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,450
别这样  坐下好吗
Please. Please, take a seat.

1610
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,120
坐吧  黛西
Go on, Daisy.

1611
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,580
黛西  这是怎么回事
Daisy, what's been going on?

1612
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,880
-我要听来龙去脉  -我告诉过你了
- I want to hear about it. - I told you what's going on.

1613
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,750
我们之间已经五年了
It's been going on for five years.

1614
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:32,340
你和这家伙交往五年了
You've been seeing him for five years?

1615
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:36,050
不  没有交往  我们见不了面
No, no, no, not seeing. Not seeing, we couldn't.

1616
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,970
但这五年我们一直深爱着对方
But both of us loved each other all that time. Didn't we?

1617
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:40,350
就这呀
Oh, that's all.

1618
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,100
你真是疯了
You're crazy!

1619
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:46,360
我说不好五年前的事
I can't speak about what happened five years ago

1620
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,110
因为那时我还不认识黛西
because I didn't know Daisy then.

1621
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:51,240
我也想不通你是怎么接近她的
And I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her

1622
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,160
除非你是杂货店送货的
unless you brought the groceries to the back door.

1623
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,120
至于你其它的话都是扯淡
But all the rest of that is a goddamn lie.

1624
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,790
黛西嫁给我时就爱着我
Daisy loved me when she married me,

1625
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,380
现在也是
and she loves me now.

1626
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:02,890
不  很抱歉  布坎南先生
No. No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan.

1627
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:04,210
-她不爱你  -她爱我
- No. - She does! She does, though.

1628
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:05,250
她仍然爱我
No, she does, though.

1629
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,000
她爱我  而我也爱着她
She does. And what's more, I love Daisy too.

1630
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,380
我爱你  黛西
No. I love you, Daisy.

1631
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:17,180
有时我会做些荒唐事  可我总会回头
Now, once in a while I go off on a spree. I always come back.

1632
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,850
-荒唐事  -我心底里一直爱着她
- A spree. - And in my heart I love her all the time.

1633
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,350
你真令人作呕
You're revolting.

1634
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,340
知道我们为什么离开芝加哥吗
You know why we left Chicago?

1635
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,000
他们竟然没有告诉你
I'm surprised they didn't treat you

1636
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,270
他干的那点儿荒唐事
to the story of that little spree!

1637
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,440
那一切都结束了  黛西
That's all over now, Daisy, darling. That's all over.

1638
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,150
告诉他实情
Just tell him the truth. Go on.

1639
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,260
告诉他你从未爱过他
That you never loved him

1640
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,200
过去的一切就一笔勾销了
and this will all be wiped out forever.

1641
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,440
我怎么可能爱他
How could I love him possibly?

1642
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,830
别忘了咱们的计划
Remember our plans.

1643
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,100
告诉他你从未爱过他
You tell him that you never loved him

1644
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,790
所有这些痛苦就成为过眼云烟了
and all this pain will be wiped out forever.

1645
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,790
黛西
Daisy.

1646
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,460
黛西  告诉他
Daisy, tell him.

1647
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,000
我从没爱过他
I never loved him.

1648
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:53,840
从没有吗
Never?

1649
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:56,050
-没有  -没有
- No. - No.

1650
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,050
在夏威夷凯皮奥兰尼也没有吗
Not at Kapiolani?

1651
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,820
我怕你打湿鞋  把你从游艇上抱下来
Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl

1652
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:06,100
你也没爱过我吗
to keep your shoes dry?

1653
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:11,900
没有过吗
Never?

1654
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,610
请别说了
Please don't.

1655
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,400
黛西
Daisy.

1656
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,410
杰
There, Jay.

1657
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:21,240
你的要求太过分了
You want too much.

1658
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:23,780
我现在爱你  难道这还不够吗
I love you now. Isn't that enough?

1659
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,660
过去的事我无法挽回
I can't help what's past.

1660
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:28,250
我确实曾经爱过他  但我也爱过你啊
I did love him once, but I loved you too.

1661
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,420
你也爱过我
You loved me too?

1662
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:34,800
你也爱我
You loved me...?

1663
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:35,970
连这也是谎话
Even that is a lie!

1664
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:37,090
她根本不知道你还活着
She didn't know you were alive!

1665
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,160
黛西和我之间有些事
There are things between Daisy and me, Gatsby,

1666
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,430
你永远也不会知道
that you'll never know.

1667
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,110
我们两个永远也不会忘记
Things that neither of us can ever forget.

1668
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,680
我要单独和黛西谈谈
I need to speak to Daisy alone.

1669
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:47,050
她被你弄得太激动了  老伙计
You see, you've got her all excited now, don't you, old sport?

1670
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:48,450
黛西
Daisy.

1671
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,780
就算单独谈我也不能说从未爱过汤姆
Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom.

1672
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:52,150
那不是真心话
It wouldn't be true.

1673
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,480
-什么  -当然不是真心话
- What? - Of course it wouldn't.

1674
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,690
-好像你还在乎似的  -当然在乎了
- As if it mattered to you. - Of course it matters!

1675
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,650
从今天起我要更好的照顾你
I'm gonna take better care of you from now on.

1676
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,070
你没机会再照顾她了  她要离开你了
You're not taking care of Daisy anymore. She's leaving you.

1677
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,410
胡扯
Nonsense!

1678
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,450
-我的确要离开你  -别  别
- I am, though! - No, no, no.

1679
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:05,660
她不会离开我的
She is not leaving me.

1680
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:09,500
肯定不会为了像你这样的江湖骗子离开我
Certainly not for a common swindler like you.

1681
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,130
盖茨比先生  你到底是谁
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

1682
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:15,230
我调查了一下你
I made an investigation into your affairs.

1683
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,210
你是跟迈耶·沃尔夫山姆一起的
You're one of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.

1684
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,760
求你了  咱们回家吧
Please, let's go home.

1685
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,930
他和沃尔夫山姆这家伙买下了很多杂货店
See, he and this Wolfshiem, they bought up drugstores.

1686
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:23,640
暗地里贩卖私酒
And sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter.

1687
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:25,140
那又怎样呢  老伙计
What about it, old sport?

1688
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,520
别叫我老伙计
Don't you call me "Old sport."

1689
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,140
这杂货店生意还只是
And this drugstore business is just small change

1690
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:30,770
他和沃尔夫山姆耍的
compared to this bonds stunt

1691
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:32,400
许多小把戏之一呢
that you and Wolfshiem have got going.

1692
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,230
你的朋友沃尔特·切斯可不觉得和我们合伙丢人
Your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in?

1693
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:36,400
我想过这个问题
I gave that some thought.

1694
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,970
像沃尔特·切斯这样久负盛名的银行家
How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase

1695
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:41,360
是怎样欠沃尔夫山姆这样的小卒
find himselfup to his eyeballs in debt.

1696
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,370
-我来告诉你  -一屁股债的呢
- I'll tell you. - to a little kike like Wolfshiem?

1697
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,790
-因为贪婪  老伙计  -没错
- It's called greed, old sport. - That's right!

1698
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,910
你还把半个华尔街的人都请到
And you have half of Wall Street out there swilling your

1699
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,830
你每个周末的免费酒会上
free booze at that fun park every weekend.

1700
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,500
他竟然没想拉你下水吗
I'm surprised he hasn't tried to drag you in.

1701
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,420
天哪  他还真这么干了
My God, he has.

1702
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:58,840
他跟这没关系...
He's got nothing to do with...

1703
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:00,300
跟你花天酒地的生活吗
With your little racket.

1704
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,850
黛西
Daisy.

1705
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:05,310
黛西
Daisy.

1706
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,560
这个人有大房子  酒会和光鲜的衣服
Can't you see who this guy is

1707
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:13,610
你就看不清他的真面目了吗
with his house and his parties and his fancy clothes?

1708
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:17,820
他只不过是沃尔夫山姆的马前卒
He is just a front for Wolfshiem,

1709
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:21,030
引诱沃尔特·切斯这样的上流人士上钩的小弟
a gangster to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter Chase.

1710
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,490
老伙计  你身上唯一上流的东西是你的钱
The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money.

1711
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,680
仅此而已  而我的钱和你不相上下
Your money, that's it. Now I've just as much as you.

1712
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:28,040
我们平起平坐
That means we're equal.

1713
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,160
不  不
Oh, no. No.

1714
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,580
我们大相径庭
We're different.

1715
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:33,960
我
I am.

1716
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,460
他们
They are.

1717
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,750
她
She is.

1718
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,250
我们都和你不一样
We're all different from you.

1719
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:42,380
我们出身不一样
You see, we were born different.

1720
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,840
我们流淌的血液不同
It's in our blood

1721
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:48,970
无论你做什么说什么  哪怕你去偷
and nothing that you do or say or steal

1722
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:51,730
我们都是你做梦也无法企及的
or dream up can ever change that.

1723
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,850
像黛西这样的女孩...
A girl like Daisy...

1724
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,230
你给我闭嘴
You shut up!

1725
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,150
别说了
Shut up!

1726
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,650
给我闭嘴  闭嘴
You shut up! Shut up!

1727
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,530
闭上你的嘴
Shut up!

1728
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:11,120
那一刻  盖茨比看上去
Gatsby looked, in that moment

1729
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:15,960
仿佛刚刚杀了个人
as if he had killed a man.

1730
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,060
我诚恳地...
My sincerest...

1731
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,150
诚恳地表示歉意
My sincerest apologies.

1732
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:43,650
我没控制好自己的脾气
I seem to have lost my temper.

1733
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,490
这就对了  盖茨比先生
That's right, Mr. Gatsby.

1734
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,290
瞧瞧你在牛津学的礼节
Show us some of those fine Oxford manners.

1735
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:50,620
黛西  亲爱的
Daisy, darling.

1736
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:54,750
没事的  别介意
None of this has any consequence.

1737
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:56,750
黛西
Daisy.

1738
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:59,840
黛西  说话呀  亲爱的
Daisy, talk to me, darling.

1739
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,380
我刚才失控了  仅此而已
I just lost my temper, that's all.

1740
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,800
他开始情绪激动地讲话
He began talking excitedly,

1741
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,300
可每一句话
but with every word

1742
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:09,220
都让黛西越来越想离开这一切
Daisy was drawing further and further into herself.

1743
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,260
...去你父母在路易斯维尔的家
...to go to your parents' house in Louisville.

1744
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,060
求你了  汤姆  我再也受不了了
Please, Tom, I can't stand it anymore!

1745
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,570
你们两个坐盖茨比先生的车回家吧
Why don't you two start on home in Mr. Gatsby's car.

1746
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:23,480
-黛西  亲爱的  看着我  -走吧
- Daisy, darling, look at me. - Go on.

1747
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:24,650
黛西
Daisy.

1748
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,820
他不会烦你的
He won't annoy you.

1749
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:29,280
他应该知道调情到此为止了
I think he realizes that this little flirtation is over.

1750
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,620
黛西 黛西
Daisy? Daisy!

1751
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,430
还喝吗
You want any of this?

1752
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,930
乔丹
Jordan?

1753
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:50,140
尼克
Nick?

1754
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:54,020
尼克
Nick.

1755
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,310
什么
What?

1756
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,060
来点儿吗
You want any?

1757
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,650
不了
No.

1758
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:05,860
我刚想起来今天是我生日
I just remembered today's my birthday.

1759
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:11,780
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1760
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,960
三十岁了  又一个孤独的十年
Thirty. The promise of a decade of loneliness.

1761
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,590
三十而立的惊喜逐渐消失
The formidable stroke of 30 died away

1762
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:27,220
就像盖茨比和黛西在渐渐凉爽的暮色中
as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight

1763
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:31,010
驶向死亡
towards death.

1764
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,770
别跟我撒谎
Don't you lie to me!

1765
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,770
你从哪弄来的这个
Hey, where'd you get these from?

1766
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,440
你也许能愚弄我  但你骗不过上帝
You might fool me, but you don't fool God!

1767
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,150
上帝无所不知
God sees everything!

1768
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:46,440
桃金娘
Myrtle!

1769
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:47,820
你去哪了
Where are you?

1770
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:55,200
是汤姆吗
Tom?

1771
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:56,490
汤姆
Tom!

1772
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:58,330
汤姆

如果没有正当理由进入楼内

没准就是他勾引的桃金娘
Maybe he was the one that was fooling around with Myrtle.

1844
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:14,790
也许就是因为这他才杀了她

像他这样的人  谁知道呢

那也没必要杀了她

连车都没停
He didn't even stop his car.

1854
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,430
你还要为他说话吗
You gonna defend him now?

1855
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:26,280
我去叫辆出租  尼克

1870

I thought so.

1871
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,220
我对黛西也是这么说的
I told Daisy that I thought so.

1872
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:29,350
黛西  你说的是什么啊
Daisy? Do you hear yourself?

1873
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:30,470
你怎么能这样
How could you?

1874
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,560
你怎么能这样做
How could you do that?

1875
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,720
-小点儿声  -你怎么回事
- Keep your voice down. -What's wrong with you?

1876
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:34,840
你就是个懦夫
You're nothing but a goddamn coward!

1877
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,140
小点儿声
Keep your voice down!

1878
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:38,650
别吵吵  当时没必要停车...
Please. There was no point in stop...

1879
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:42,070
怎么没必要  那个女人怎么办
No point'? No point? What about that woman?

1880
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:44,610
没必要  她当时就被撞死了
No point. She was killed instantly.

1881
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:45,880
没错  都开膛破肚了
Yes, it ripped her open!

1882
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,610
我去过那  看到她了

1885
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:54,160
那个女人朝我们直冲过来
This woman, she rushed out at us

1886
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,200
好像想和我们说话
as if she was trying to speak to us.

1887
01:51:55,370 --> 01:51:57,420
一切发生的都太快了
It all happened so quickly.

1888
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:00,130
-她...  我想扳过方向盘  -她

1889
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:01,500
可是
but...

1890
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,690
是黛西撞的人
It was Daisy.

1891
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,530
离开纽约后  她精神非常紧张
You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous.

1892
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:37,000
她觉得开车可以舒缓心情
She thought that driving would steady her.

1893
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:42,500
而这个女人却向我们扑来

事情发生的太快了
It all happened so quickly.

1895
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:49,840
这不是她的错  明白吗
It wasn't her fault, do you see?

1896
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:14,370
黛西开车的事绝不能有任何人知道
No one must know that Daisy was driving.

1897
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,700
答应我
Promise me.

1898
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:21,670
杰  你得回家休息休息
Jay, you should go home and get some rest.

1899
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:23,240

1901
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,420
别这样  这样不好
No, no, no. That's not a good idea.

1902
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,540
如果他敢因为下午的不愉快
If he tries to bother her

1903
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:30,420
而找她麻烦
about that unpleasantness this afternoon,

1904
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,630
如果他敢打搅她
If he tries to bother her,

1905
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,680
如果他敢对她乱来的话...
If he tries any brutality on her whatsoever...

1906
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,010
汤姆不会碰她的  他现在想的不是她
Tom won't touch her. He's not even thinking about her.

1907
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:38,970
我不相信他
I don't trust him.

1908
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:41,810
-我信不过他  -好吧
- I don't trust him. - All right.

1909
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:42,940
好吧

我去看看有什么情况
I'll see if there's any commotion.

1912
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:53,450
真的吗
Would you?

1913
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:00,040
谢谢  老伙计
Thank you, old sport.

1914
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,050
是她的错  是她自己跑到马路上的
Listen, she was in the wrong, running out on the road.

1915
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,760
亲爱的  不用担心
Sweetheart, you have nothing to worry about.

1916
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:15,180
交给我来处理
Let me take care of things.

1917
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:16,850

Take care of you.

1918
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,640
我去打几个电话
I'll make some calls.

1919
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,640
然后我们就离开
We'll go away.

1920
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,690
离开这城市
Just go away, get out of town.

1921
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:25,980
你休息一下  别担心
Get some rest. Don't worry.

1922
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:28,900
没事的
It'll be all right.

Everything's just fine.

1927
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:12,990
凌晨4点的时候  她来到窗前
Four o'clock, she... she came to the window.

1928
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:15,490
就站在那
She stood there, then...

1929
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:18,990
然后把灯关掉了
She turned out the light, so...

1930
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,250
来帮帮忙  好吧  老伙计
Give me a hand, will you, old sport?

1931
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,420
我本该告诉他我刚见到的  但是
I should have told him what I had just seen, but...

1932
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,750
说出口的却是
All I could manage was:

1933
01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:34,090
杰  发生了这些事
You know, Jay, with everything that's happened,

1934
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,840
你应该离开
you ought to go away.

1935
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,430
就今晚  他们会追踪你的车
Tonight. They'll trace your car.

1936
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:39,510
离开  不  现在我不能离开
Go away? No, I can't leave now.

1937
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:40,680
起码不是今晚
Not tonight.

1938
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:42,930
杰  你知道死人了吗
Jay, do you understand that a woman has been killed?

1939
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:44,770
黛西会在早上打给我
Daisy's going to call in the morning.

1940
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:48,100
之后我们计划一起离开
Then we'll make plans to go away together.

1941
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:51,440
-没错  -黛西她...
- Yeah. - Daisy, she...

1942
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:53,860
她只是需要时间想清楚  赫佐格
She just needs time to think things through. Herzog.

1943
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,860
我们有话要说  谢谢
We're talking. Thank you.

1944
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,950
她只是需要时间想想
She just needs time to think.

1945
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,580
不  杰  黛西她...
No, Jay. With Daisy...

1946
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:09,710
她只是需要时间想想  早上她会打来的
She just needs time to think. She's going to call in the morning.

1947
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,090
跟我一起等吧
Wait up with me.

1948
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,140
太阳快要升起了
The sun's almost up.

1949
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:32,900
终于在那晚  他把一切都告诉了我
That was the night he finally told me the truth.

1950
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:34,320
毫无保留
All of it.

1951
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,910
我曾经觉得
You know, I've thought for a while,

1952
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:44,870
我拥有很多  但其实我一无所有
I had a lot of things, but the truth is I'm empty.

1953
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,960
我想这就是我要说谎的原因
I suppose that's why I make things up about myself.

1954
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:52,500
但很早以前我就想告诉你整件事
But I've wanted to tell you the whole story for a very long time.

1955
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:56,630
我出身贫寒  老伙计
See, I grew up terribly, terribly poor, old sport.

1956
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,110
我的家人...
My folks were...

1957
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,180
他透露了他卑微的出身
He revealed his humble beginnings,

1958
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:03,550
与丹·科迪改变命运的航行
his transformative voyage with Dan Cody,

1959
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:06,350
战争  牛津大学
the war, Oxford,

1960
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,810
还有他是如何加入沃尔夫山姆的生意当中
and how he joined Wolfshiem in the business.

1961
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:12,690
也是在那一晚
It was also that night,

1962
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:16,940
我意识到盖茨比天生非常乐观
that I became aware of Gatsby's extraordinary gift for hope.

1963
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:17,950
我无法形容
I can't describe

1964
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,150
发现自己爱上她时感到多诧异
how surprised I was to find out that I loved her.

1965
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,450
而且她也爱我
And that she loved me too.

1966
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:24,580
我从未见过谁天生就这么乐观
A gift that I have never found in any other person.

1967
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:29,410
没想到还有这么好的女孩
I never realized how extraordinary a nice girl could be.

1968
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:33,130
我觉得也不再会有了
And which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

1969
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:35,170
我在想有了黛西以后的生活
I thought out my life with Daisy in it,

1970
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,620
想怎样才能跟她结婚
trying to figure out how we could marry

1971
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:38,630
才能负担起每月庞大的开销
and struggle along on so many dollars a month.

1972
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,470
信中说了什么
What was in the letter?

1973
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:49,640
为什么战后我不能回去
The reason why after the war I hadn't been able to return.

1974
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:52,940
我让她等我  等我有所成就
I asked her to wait until I made something of myself,

1975
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,560
但她却...
but she was...

1976
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,610
我觉得已经和她永结连理了
See, I felt married to her.

1977
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:02,860
就是这样
That was all.

1978
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,200
一切都是为了她
It was all for her.

1979
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,870
房子  派对
The house, the parties.

1980
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,200
所有的一切
Everything.

1981
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:18,630
一切尽在上帝眼里
God sees everything.

1982
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:29,520
盖茨比先生  很抱歉
Mr. Gatsby, sir, excuse me.

1983
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:31,480
芝加哥来电  先生
Chicago calling, sir.

1984
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,890
现在不是时候
Not now.

1985
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,310
待会我再打过去
Keep it open for a personal call.

1986
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,200
再打过去  好的
A personal call? Of course.

1987
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:42,510
抱歉  盖茨比先生  我准备今天清池子
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Gatsby, I'm gonna drain the pool today,

1988
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:43,610
趁着叶子还没落
before the leaves start falling in.

1989
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,240
今天不行
Not today.

1990
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:49,870
今天不行  真漂亮
Not today, it's so beautiful.

1991
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:55,810
老伙计  我整个夏天都没下过泳池
You know, old sport, I haven't used that pool once all summer.

1992
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:56,770
我们去游个泳吧
Let's take a swim.

1993
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,490
把电话放到泳池边
Have the phone brought down to the pool.

1994
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,350
我得走了  杰
I have to go, Jay.

1995
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,440
我得去上班了
I have to work.

1996
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:21,360
好吧
I understand.

1997
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:26,030
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

1998
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:36,500
我会打给你的
Well, I'll call you up.

1999
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:39,170
一言为定  老伙计  一言为定
Please do, old sport. Please do.

2000
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,670
我想黛西也会打来的
I supposed that Daisy will call too.

2001
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:52,310
我...我想也是
I... I suppose.

2002
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:54,560
是啊
Yes.

2003
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:58,690
再见
Well, goodbye.

2004
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:18,790
杰
Jay!

2005
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,500
现在人们都腐朽至极
They're a rotten crowd.

2006
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,300
他们加起来也比不上你一个
You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.

2007
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:39,730
我很高兴我说了出来
I was always glad I said that.

2008
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:44,660
因为我只称赞过他那么一次
It was the only compliment I ever paid him.

2009
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:49,670
那天早晨
That morning,

2010
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:53,990
华尔街仍旧欣欣向荣
Wall Street boomed its usual golden roar.

2011
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:57,960
但我一点工作的心思也没有
But I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work.

2012
02:00:58,870 --> 02:01:01,830
我在等盖茨比打来告诉我消息
I waited for Gatsby to call with news.

2013
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:07,460
当他在等黛西电话时...
While he waited for Daisy...

2014
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,340
盖茨比宅邸
Gatsby's.

2015
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,970
盖茨比先生很高兴你打过来
I know Mr. Gatsby will be very happy that you've called.

2016
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:20,160
黛西
Daisy.

2017
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,890
喂  喂
Hello! Hello!

2018
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:46,560
喂  一切都还好吗
Hello! Is everything all right?

2019
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:55,070
喂  喂
Hello! Hello!

2020
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,620
喂
Hello!

2021
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,830
喂  一切都还好吗
Hello! Is everything all right?

2022
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,960
我还记得那天余下的时间
I remember the rest of that day

2023
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:14,970
充斥着络绎不绝的警察
as an endless drill of police

2024
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:17,970
摄影师和小报记者
and photographers and tabloid reporters.

2025
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,930
新闻头条简直是一场噩梦
The headlines were a nightmare.

2026
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:23,750
贩卖私酒者怒杀情妇

2027
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,140
他们把责任都推到盖茨比头上
They pinned everything on Gatsby.

2028
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:27,360
与桃金娘的私情  肇事逃逸
The affair with Myrtle. The hit-and-run.

2029
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:27,010
肇事逃逸

2030
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:28,560
盖茨比畏罪自杀

2031
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,690
所有的一切
Everything.

2032
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,900
我又能说什么呢
And there was nothing I could say,

2033
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:36,110
除了一切都是假的这个难言的事实以外
except the one unutterable fact that none of it was true.

2034
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,420
亲爱的  爸爸正在照顾着
Darling, Daddy's taking care of

2035
02:03:38,430 --> 02:03:39,910
他最爱的两个姑娘
his two favorite girls.

2036
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,280
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

2037
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,790
-去度假  -该走了
- We're going on a holiday. - We should go.

2038
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:47,000
只有你和我  还有爸爸
Just you me and Daddy.

2039
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:50,590
布坎南宅邸
Buchanan residence.

2040
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:52,170
我找布坎南夫人
May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan?

2041
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:54,130
我是卡罗威先生  她的表弟
It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin.

2042
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:57,010
夫人她没空  卡罗威先生
Madame is not available, Monsieur Carraway.

2043
02:03:57,470 --> 02:04:00,350
要是碰到她  告诉她葬礼在明天
If you speak to her, tell her the funeral's tomorrow.

2044
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:02,470
很抱歉  先生  他们已经走了
I'm sorry, monsieur, they have gone away.

2045
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:03,470
走了
Gone away?

2046
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:05,480
你知道他们什么时候回来吗
Do you know when they'll be back?

2047
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:09,020
不知道
No.

2048
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:11,150
他们已经离开了
They have already departed.

2049
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:19,360
求你了  她肯定想出席的  她...
Please. I know that she would want to be there. She would...

2050
02:04:19,570 --> 02:04:21,450
只要你告诉她就可以了
If you would just get a message to her.

2051
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:24,830
-让我跟她说  求你了  -你想找她
- Let me talk to her, please. - You wish to contact her?

2052
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,460
我也不知道她去了哪  先生
I have no further information, monsieur.

2053
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:29,000
求你了
Please!

2054
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
再见
Au revoir.

2055
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:33,090
喂
Hello?

2056
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:41,220
走吧
Come on.

2057
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:44,390
他们都是冷漠的人  汤姆跟黛西
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy.

2058
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,690
他们出来闹个天翻地覆
They smashed up things and people

2059
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:50,690
再退到他们的钱
and then retreated back into their money

2060
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,980
和冷漠筑成的围城
and their vast carelessness.

2061
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:57,780
快滚出去
Hey! Get out of here!

2062
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,490
出去
Go on!

2063
02:04:59,650 --> 02:05:01,200
快给我滚出去
Get the hell out of here!

2064
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:16,170
我打电话
I rang,

2065
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:17,920
写信
I wrote,

2066
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:20,090
苦苦哀求
I implored.

2067
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,770
但受过他款待的人
But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds

2068
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:29,390
没一个来参加他的葬礼
that enjoyed his hospitality attended the funeral.

2069
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:31,650
至于黛西
And from Daisy,

2070
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:34,310
连朵花都没送
not even a flower.

2071
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:38,360
我就是他的所有
I was all he had.

2072
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:41,360
唯一还关心他的人
The only one who cared.

2073
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,560
盖茨比死后
After Gatsby's death,

2074
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,980
纽约一直萦绕着我
New York was haunted for me.

2075
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:20,530
这座城市
That city,

2076
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:26,200
我曾憧憬着熠熠生辉的海市蜃楼
my once golden shimmering mirage,

2077
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,870
如今竟让我感到恶心
now made me sick.

2078
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,960
在纽约的最后一晚
On my last night in New York,

2079
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,920
我再次回到那座庞大杂乱的房子
I returned to that huge incoherent house once more.

2080
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:45,140
沃尔夫山姆的伙伴已把这清空
Wolfshiem's associates had cleaned it out.

2081
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:48,560
他办那么多的派对只为她一晚的出现
He threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night.

2082
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:50,060
这就像个游乐园
It's like an amusement park.

2083
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:52,140
但你一个人怎么住呢
But how do you live here all alone?

2084
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:54,520
她让一切都熠熠生辉
She makes it look so splendid.

2085
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:55,850
不是吗  老伙计
Don't you think, old sport?

2086
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:59,730
音乐  这样我们就可以彻夜狂舞了
Music! And then we can dance all night!

2087
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,820
你会来吗  老伙计
Will you come, old sport?

2088
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:04,110
我们需要你
We need you.

2089
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,410
真希望一直这样
I wish it could always be like this.

2090
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:08,240
会的
It will be.

2091
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,200
我还记得我们是如何齐聚在盖茨比家
I remembered how we had all come to Gatsby's

2092
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:15,370
猜测他如何腐败
and guessed at his corruption.

2093
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,540
而他就站在我们面前
While he stood before us,

2094
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:22,090
心中纯洁无比
concealing an incorruptible dream.

2095
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:28,010
很完美  出自你完美的  不可抗拒的想象力
It's perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination.

2096
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:35,940
月亮渐渐升起
The moon rose higher.

2097
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,790
当我站在那
And as I stood there,

2098
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:40,860
怀缅这个古老而又未知的世界时
brooding on the old, unknown world,

2099
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,560
我想到了盖茨比
I thought of Gatsby's wonder,

2100
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:46,040
第一次在黛西家的码头尽头
when he first picked out the green light

2101
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:47,860
看到绿光时的惊喜
at the end of Daisy's dock.

2102
02:07:53,450 --> 02:07:55,790
他历尽漫长的艰辛
He had come such a long way.

2103
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,040
想必梦想已经触手可及
And his dream must have seemed so close,

2104
02:07:59,210 --> 02:08:02,170
几乎不可能失手
that he could hardly fail to grasp it.

2105
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:09,930
但他却不知道其实梦想早已落在他身后
But he did not know that it was already behind him.

2106
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:14,720
盖茨比信奉这盏绿灯
Gatsby believed in the green light,

2107
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:19,600
快乐与我们渐行渐远
the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.

2108
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:22,520
它逃避我们  不过没关系
It eluded us then, but that's no matter.

2109
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:25,650
明天  我们将跑得更快
Tomorrow, we will run faster,

2110
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:28,360
手臂将伸得更远
stretch out our arms farther.

2111
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:31,370
在一个晴朗的早晨
And one fine morning,

2112
02:08:31,530 --> 02:08:33,620
我们努力向前划
So we beat on,

2113
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,410
逆流而上的小舟
boats against the current,

2114
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,750
不停地
borne back,

2115
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,750
被浪潮
ceaselessly,

2116
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,170
推回过去
into the past.

2117
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:54,630
《盖茨比》  尼克·卡罗威著

2118
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:17,240
《了不起的盖茨比》
