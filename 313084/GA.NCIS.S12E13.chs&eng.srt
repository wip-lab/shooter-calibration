看起来死者生前跟别人打了一架

我想我们找到死者拳上伤口的来源了
I think we found the source of our victim's battered knuckles.

111

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,330
而且他不会和我们谈论他的情感问题

但是Hollis Mann 他们说着同样的沉默语言

157
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,390
你怎么...

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,530
我们会去查的 不过首先
Yeah, we're gonna get to that. But first, um,

266
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,800
不如你跟我们讲讲
why don't you tell us about your discharge

267
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,070
2007年从海军陆战队退役的事吧

退役的原因是啥来着 McGee

让对方措手不及
try to catch the subject off-guard.

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,800
-有用么 -没有
- How's it working? - It's not.

290
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
-我也这么觉得 -我们这是去哪儿
- Didn't think so. - So where are we going?

291
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,350
你的服役记录里有些细节消失不见

292

我从没有恐吓过我的指挥官

说如果我保持沉默 他们会让我
Said if I went quietly, they would give me

301
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,520
正常退役 而非"不荣誉退役"

I loved Eric.

308
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,960
我永远不会伤害他
I would never hurt him.

309
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,360
我觉得你在隐瞒什么
See, I think you're hiding something.

310
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
我猜是为了保护你的伴侣
I'm guessing it's to protect your partner.

311
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,480
Eric理应被当成一位英雄来纪念
Eric deserves to be remembered for what he was, a hero.

312
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,570
什么也改变不了这个事实
Nothing should change that.

313
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,080
我的工作是抓住凶手
My job is to find who killed him,

314
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,580
而不是政治迫害 你得相信我
not start a witch hunt, and you need to trust me.

315
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,640
早上我回到家时 厨房里有个袋子
When I came home this morning, there was a bag in the kitchen.

316
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,770
我之前没见过那个袋子
I hadn't seen it before.

317
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,760
里面装了不少药瓶和注射器
There was vials and syringes.

318
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,750
我不知道Eric为什么会有那些玩意儿 但肯定不是他的
I don't know why Eric had them, but they're not his.

319
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,120
-你怎么知道 -他是有不少恶习
- How can you be sure of that? - He had his

320
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,690
但绝不会沾染毒品 他瞒不了我
demons, but drugs wasn't one of them. I would know.

321
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,880
你把袋子藏到哪儿了
Where'd you hide them?

322
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,880
在车库里
In the garage.

323
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,760
我不该动犯罪现场
I shouldn't have touched the crime scene,

324
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
但我知道这事会影响Eric的形象
but I knew it would make Eric look bad and I didn't

325
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,840
我不想耽误他的荣誉勋章提名
want it to affect his Medal of Honor nomination.

326
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,010
我丈夫
My husband

327
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,350
是个好人 Gibbs探员
was a good man, Agent Gibbs.

328
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
我救不回他的性命
I couldn't save his life.

329
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,040
但是请你
But please...

330
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,660
拜托你
please...

331
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,110
帮我保护他的名誉
help me protect his memory.

332
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,240
有什么进展 姑娘们
What's the latest, Team Babbs?

333
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,360
刚得到Jimmy的消息
Uh, just got an update from Jimmy.

334
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,010
说Breena仍在分娩中 他听上去有点儿慌
Breena is still in labor. He sounded a little freaked.

335
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,200
Jimmy就要成为父亲了
Jimmy's gonna be a father.

336
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,430
就好像 前一天
It's like, one day

337
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,250
你还只是你自己
you're just... you're you,

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,950
然后第二天 你就要
and then the next day you're responsible for this

339
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,570
为一个鲜活的灵魂负起责任
living, breathing soul.

340
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,930
我不想打断你 Abbs 但是飓风Gibbs
I hate to interrupt, Abbs, but Hurricane Gibbs

341
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,240
马上就要登陆了 你有什么发现
is about to make landfall. What do you got?

342
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,890
Kutzler的药检
Kutzler's tox screen--

343
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,320
清清白白 他没吸毒
it's clean. He wasn't on drugs.

344
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,460
那我们从车库
What about the narcotics

345
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,310
-收缴来的这些麻醉剂呢 -每个药瓶
- we confiscated from his garage? - Each vial

346
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,340
都装有符合制药标准的吗啡和芬太尼
contains pharmaceutical-grade morphine and fentanyl.

347
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,340
{\a6}前者是麻醉剂 后者是止痛剂

348
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,040
两者混合 就是一只
Mixed together, they make one

349
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,230
极其强效的静脉注射剂
very potent intravenous cocktail.

350
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,950
也就是我要说的下一点
Which brings me to my next point.

351
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,440
这批药是自制的 我是说
This batch is homemade. I mean, this distinct

352
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
看这独特的药瓶颜色和标签
color and this labeling--

353
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,750
-这是某人的招牌 -唔
- this is somebody's brand. - Hmm.

354
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,020
某人肯定是看太多《绝命毒师》了
Somebody who's seen a little too much Breaking Bad.

355
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,150
真怀念那部剧
Miss that show.

356
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,450
只要一小瓶这东西 在道上
Just one vial of this stuff fetches a steep

357
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,930
-可以卖到很高的价钱 -所以如果Kutzler
- take on the street. So if Kutzler wasn't

358
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,040
没有吸毒 或许他是在贩毒
taking drugs, maybe he was selling them?

359
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,390
战斗英雄转行毒贩 真是个蛮大的角色转换
War hero to drug peddler-- that's a big shift.

360
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
如果这毒品不属于Kutzler
Well, if they weren't Kutzler's drugs,

361
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,980
它们一定属于某个人
they belonged to someone.

362
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,870
愿意为此杀人灭口的人
Someone willing to kill for them.

363
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,760
啊 Hollis 你见到Jethro了没
Ah, Hollis, have you seen Jethro?

364
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,310
我刚给他留言
I just left word for him.

365
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,340
我暗自疑心 他在努力回避我 医生
I have the sneaking suspicion he's trying to avoid me, Doctor.

366
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,880
你跟上尉很熟么
Did you know the lieutenant well?

367
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,020
不 我们上周才见面
No, we met once, last week.

368
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,870
为了荣誉勋章提名
I was fact-checking his account

369
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,160
我要审核他被伏击的整个事实经过
of the ambush for the nomination.

370
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,860
我看得出来 他还没有摆脱梦魇
I could see he was still haunted by it.

371
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,710
是啊 身体上的伤口可以愈合
Yeah, well, the body can recover physically.

372
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,100
而治疗心灵创伤可就复杂多了
Healing the mind, however, is a little more complex.

373
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,630
我听说了Diane的事
Listen, I heard about Diane.

374
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,320
Jethro还好么
How's Jethro been doing?

375
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,230
我联系过他 但他没有
I reached out, but he hasn't returned

376
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,240
-回我的电话 -嗯
- any of my calls. - Well,

377
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,400
Jethro更情愿投身于工作
Jethro does prefer to throw himself into his work.

378
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,940
我努力想陪伴在他身边 可他不接受
Well, I'm trying to be there for him. He's not letting me.

379
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,830
与Jethro为友
A friendship with Jethro

380
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,040
确实要面对不少挑战
does have its share of challenges.

381
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,360
然而 我怀疑
However, I suspect

382
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,960
他一直和我们保持距离
that there may be another reason

383
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,900
或许还有另一个原因
why he's been keeping us all at a distance.

384
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,590
-Ducky 你找我 -呃
- Ducky, you called me. - Uh,

385
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,430
是的 我在Kutzler上尉的药检中
yes, I found something unusual in

386
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,000
发现了些异常状况
Lieutenant Kutzler's toxicology.

387
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,500
Abby说一切正常
Abby said it was clean.

388
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,230
这就是异常状况
Well, that's the anomaly.

389
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,070
他的血液中
There are no traces of any

390
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,600
没有任何药物痕迹
medical substances in his bloodstream.

391
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,220
我没明白问题所在 Duck
I'm not seeing the problem here, Duck.

392
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,600
上尉扑向那颗手榴弹时
When the lieutenant threw himself on that grenade,

393
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,060
他的身体吸收了爆炸的强力冲击
his body absorbed the force of the explosion.

394
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,010
他的躯干受到全面影响 肋骨折断
His torso took the full impact, breaking his ribs

395
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,360
肺部也受到损伤
and collapsing his lungs.

396
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,790
防弹衣
This flak jacket

397
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,750
保护了他的重要器官
protected his vital organs from the shrapnel.

398
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,650
爆炸向上冲击
The blast blew upwards,

399
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,670
使他差点失去右臂
fracturing his right arm almost beyond repair.

400
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,900
下颌骨断裂
It severed his jawbone,

401
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,560
撕裂了他的右眼窝
tore through his right eye socket,

402
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,840
并挫伤了头盖骨
and fractured his skull. Mm.

403
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,080
他遭受了毁灭性的创伤
He suffered catastrophic wounds.

404
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,450
因此 医生给他开了各种药物
Consequently, he was prescribed with numerous medications

405
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,680
来辅助复原
to aid in the recovery.

406
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,820
但是你看 他从没去买过一次药
But look, he never filled a single prescription.

407
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,750
他选择生活在持续不断的疼痛中
He chose to live in constant pain.

408
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,260
Kutzler认为自己要对
Kutzler felt responsible

409
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,400
在伏击中身亡的战友负责
for the men lost in the ambush.

410
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,160
疼痛是对他作为幸存者的惩罚
The pain was his punishment for surviving.

411
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,690
还有谁认为他有责任么
Anyone else feel he was at fault?

412
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,460
目前和我谈过的人中 没人这么想
No one that I've spoken to so far, but

413
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,810
但是当我提到要和目击者谈话的时候
Kutzler was apprehensive when I mentioned

414
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,120
Kutzler显得非常不安
that I was gonna be talking to the witnesses.

415
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,260
我要知道那次伏击的所有细节
I want the details of that ambush.

421

425
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,430
我询问过Donahue
Well, I've already questioned Donahue.

426
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,990
他对于整个事件的陈述
His statement of facts on the incident

427
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,050
是Kutzler获得荣誉勋章提名的关键
was pivotal in Kutzler's Medal of Honor

428
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,870
他不是嫌疑人

我可能查到些东西

436
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,630
我放到大屏幕上
Putting it up now.

437
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,300
在伏击的前一周
In the week prior to the ambush,

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
Kutzler收到一封谴责信
Kutzler received a letter

439
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,820
斥责他有妨害治安行为

440
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,060
Kutzler的服役记录里没提到此事
There's no mention of that in Kutzler's service record.

441
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,560
那是因为
That's because

442
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,880
这封谴责信后来被发信人撤销了 即他的指挥官

456
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,680
太可惜了
Damn shame.

457
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,400
-你俩关系好么 -上尉和我的关系
- Did the two of you get along? - The lieutenant

458
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,680
与军中其他上级和下属的关系
and I got along as well as any superior officer

459
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,810
是一样的
and subordinate can in the military.

460
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,250
我对Kutzler没有意见
I had no issues with Kutzler.

461
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,480
除了他档案中你写的那封谴责信
Except for the letter of reprimand you wrote in his file.

462
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
看来你查得十分细致嘛
I see you are extremely thorough.

463
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,860
对 她的确很细致
Oh, yeah. She's good like that.

464
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,780
你们也错得离谱
You're also way off base.

465
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
请指点一二
Enlighten us.

466
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,920
Kutzler的小队到达阿富汗时
When Kutzler's unit arrived in Afghanistan,

467
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,300
队伍中有些矛盾
there were growing pains.

468
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,120
有人对他公开出柜大为不满
Some men took issue with his open homosexuality.

469
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,570
"不问不说"已经成为历史了
Don't Ask Don't Tell had already been repealed.

470
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,080
Kutzler有权表明自己的性取向
Kutzler was within his rights to be out.

471
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,280
我赞成
I agree.

472
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,070
但修改法律并不会立刻转变
But changing a law doesn't suddenly

473
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,800
人们的观念
change people's beliefs.

474
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,800
发生了什么事
What happened?

475
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,000
他和一名水手在排队吃饭时
He and a fellow sailor exchanged words

476
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,220
发生了争吵 最终演变成斗殴
in the chow line, a brawl ensued.

477
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,290
作为一名军官 我们对Kutzler有更高的要求
Being an officer, Kutzler was held to a higher standard.

478
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,710
书面斥责是标准程序
Written reprimand was protocol.

479
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,630
那后来为什么又撤销了呢
So why'd you later pull it from his record?

480
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,200
我感觉不妥
It didn't sit well with me.

481
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,520
这样的谴责信会毁了Kutzler的前途
A reprimand like that would have ruined Kutzler's career.

482
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
我撤回了书面斥责 只给了他口头警告
I retracted it, gave him a verbal warning instead.

483
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,740
那跟他斗殴的水手呢
What about the sailor he fought with?

484
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,080
Davis Riley下士
Petty Officer Davis Riley.

485
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,740
他俩相处得不好
No love lost between those two.

486
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,870
我还挺喜欢建筑工地的味道
I kind of love the smell of construction.

487
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,000
木材和木屑
Lumber and sawdust.

488
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,860
就像Gibbs的地下室一样
It's kind of like Gibbs' basement.

489
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
说到Gibbs...
Speaking of Gibbs...

490
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,230
话题转得真巧妙啊 DiNozzo
Subtle, DiNozzo.

491
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,520
通常我们会指望Fornell把他变回
Normally we would rely on Fornell to bring Gibbs back

492
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,240
"瞅啥都不满意"的正常版Gibbs
to his general disgruntled self,

493
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,870
但最近Tobias并不在选择之列
but Tobias isn't really an option these days.

494
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,370
听着 我是他的朋友
Look, I'm his friend.

495
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,900
不是他的心理医生 我不能强迫他跟我说话
I'm not his shrink. I can't force him to talk to me.

496
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,400
你当然可以
Sure you can.

497
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,340
你很有说服力
You can be persuasive.

498
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,800
Davis Riley么
Davis Riley?

499
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,790
有什么能帮你们的
Can I help you?

500
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,280
海军罪案调查处
NCIS.

501
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,360
Hollis Mann 国防部 我们之前
Hollis Mann, DoD. We spoke on the phone

502
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,010
-通过电话 -噢对
- earlier. - Oh, right, yeah.

503
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,130
不是说下周才见面么
Uh, I thought we were meeting next week.

504
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,430
计划有变
Change of plans.

505
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,640
昨天午夜 你在哪里
Where we you last night around midnight?

506
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,240
我在我的公寓里 睡觉
Uh... I was at my apartment, asleep.

507
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,880
-有证人吗 -看着我睡觉的证人
- Any witnesses? - To me sleeping?

508
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,740
我是不是遗漏了什么 我以为
Am I missing something? I thought you wanted to talk to me

509
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,170
你是要找我聊Kutzler荣誉勋章提名的事
about Kutzler's nomination packet.

510
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,930
-确实如此 -对
- I did. - Yes.

511
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,700
她也的确会那么做 但是
And she's going to, but...

512
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,100
我想跟你聊聊他的谋杀案
I'd like to talk to you about his murder.

513
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,360
谋杀
Murder?

514
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,000
Kutzler上尉昨晚被枪杀了
Lieutenant Kutzler was shot and killed last night.

515
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,170
天呐
Oh, my God.

516
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,220
我...
I...

517
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,290
我要吐了
I'm gonna be sick.

518
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,720
我讨厌Kutzler
I hated everything about Kutzler.

519
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,500
不能理解他
I didn't understand him.

520
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,930
也不想理解他
Didn't want to.

521
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,740
我只想让他消失
I just wanted him gone.

522
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,370
这是认罪么
Is this a confession?

523
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,080
那是从前的我
Of the old me.

524
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,580
我已经不是那个人了 我变了
I'm not that guy anymore; I've changed.

525
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,340
你转变的时间真是
What a miraculous and conveniently timed

526
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,580
-恰到好处啊 -阿富汗的事
- change of heart. - Afghanistan was

527
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,590
为我敲响了警钟 这可没什么恰到好处的
a wake-up call-- there was nothing convenient about it.

528
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,520
前一分钟 我们还在为学校打地基
One minute... we're laying foundation for a school,

529
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,610
下一分钟 我们就被全副武装的叛军
the next, we're pinned down by insurgents,

530
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,150
压制住了
taking heavy fire.

531
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,430
五名战友没来得及找到掩护就倒下了
Five of our guys fall before they can even get to cover.

532
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,450
军士长和我被击中了 但受伤并不严重
Chief and I were hit but not critical.

533
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,710
我们看到手榴弹时
Kutzler was applying my tourniquet...

534
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,900
Kutzler正在帮我绑止血带
when we saw the grenade.

535
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,860
他没有犹豫
He didn't hesitate.

536
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,700
一秒都没迟疑 他就...
Not even for a split second. He just...

537
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,200
直接扑了上去
dove on top of it.

538
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,510
在那之后 我才真正认识了Kutzler 他是英雄
After that, I saw Kutzler for what he was-- a hero.

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,880
否则我怎么会提名他为荣誉勋章候选人
Why else would I put him up for the Medal of Honor?

540
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,000
Kutzler的提名是由Gundersen议员发起的
Kutzler's nomination packet was initiated by Senator Gundersen.

541
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,590
记录上
There's no statement

542
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,080
没有你的声明
of yours on file.

543
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,100
这 这怎么...怎么可能
How-how is that... even possible?

544
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,540
Donahue军士长和我将此事上报至指挥中心
Chief Donahue and I routed that up our chain of command

545
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,120
那是2012年的事儿了
back in 2012.

546
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,290
军方表彰提名不会凭空消失
Military award packets don't just... disappear.

547
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,770
我猜你没有什么证明材料吧
I don't suppose you have any proof?

548
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,540
我确实没有复印 如果你是这个意思
Well, I didn't make a copy, if that's what you mean.

549
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,300
问问Donahue军士长 他能为我担保
Ask Chief Donahue-- he can vouch for me.

550
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,580
Kutzler救了我的命
Kutzler saved my life.

551
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,700
我只是想回报他
I was trying to do right by him.

552
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,950
我...明白 长官 我相信那是有些不成熟
I... yes, sir, I believe that's a bit premature,

553
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,860
但是...
but it...

554
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,350
是 长官
Yes, sir.

555
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,920
我理解 但我们的探员正在
Yes, I understand, but our agents are working

556
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
夜以继日地工作...
around the clock to...

557
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,680
是 长官
Yes, sir.

558
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,110
我明白
I understand.

559
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,100
是国防部长
Secretary of Defense.

560
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,360
媒体得到风声 荣誉勋章候选人横死家中
The press got wind that a potential Medal of Honor nominee

561
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,410
还被发现私藏非法药品
was found dead with illegal narcotics in his possession.

562
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,800
怎么会
How?

563
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
这真是个好问题 Gibbs
That's the million- dollar question, Gibbs.

564
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,100
媒体正准备报道这个故事
News outlets are running with the story.

565
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,990
我们都还没明白故事是怎么回事
We don't even know what the story is yet.

566
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,170
媒体才不管这个
That's never stopped the press before.

567
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,250
而且不仅如此
And that's not all.

568
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,420
他们不会取消Kutzler的提名资格吧
They're not canceling Kutzler's nomination?

569
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,670
这事让国会山上的很多人都十分紧张
This case has got a lot of people on the Hill extremely nervous.

570
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,380
玷污国家的最高荣誉
Tarnishing the nation's highest honor

571
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,120
-是不可接受的风险 -玷污
- is not an acceptable risk. - Neither is

572
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,480
海军军官的声誉也是同样
tarnishing a naval officer's reputation.

573
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,850
我比你还讨厌这种事
I don't like it any more than you do.

574
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
国防部给我们48小时
DoD's giving us 48 hours to clear

575
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,110
为Kutzler正名
Kutzler's name.

576
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,600
在那之后 就不受我们掌控了
After that, it's out of our hands.

577
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,870
这下糟了 Tony 太糟太糟了
Oh, this is bad, Tony. This is really, really bad.

578
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,840
好吧 我们进入一级戒备状态 McGee
Okay. We're at DEFCON 1, McGee.

579
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,570
我们提高"Gibbs威胁等级"
Let's raise the Gibbs Threat Level.

580
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,320
我收缴了整栋楼里的所有报纸
I grabbed every newspaper in the building.

581
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
来 大家聚拢
All right, let's huddle up.

582
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,040
我们的任务是损害控制
So our mission now is damage control.

583
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,950
我们要做的就是
What we need to do is

584
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,090
团结一致 这事会过去的
stick together-- this, too, shall pass.

585
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,200
-嘿 进展到哪儿了 -老大来了
- Hey, where are we? - Albatross.

586
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,700
你们都站着不干活
You're all just standing around.

587
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,150
你们最好有所发现
You'd better have an update.

588
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,190
我们还在追踪Kutzler被杀当晚的轨迹
Yeah. Well, we're, we're still tracking Kutzler's movements

589
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,960
晚上七点后就没人见过他
the night of the murder. No witnesses saw him after 7:00 p.m.,

590
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,100
没使用信用卡
no credit card charges, and his cell phone pinged

591
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,880
手机一直停留在同一地点
from the same location all day.

592
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,350
在他家里 看起来
His home. Doesn't look like

593
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,440
Kutzler没有离开过 老大
Kutzler ever left, boss.

594
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,920
Abby在查他车里的GPS 但是...
Abby's working on his vehicle's GPS, but...

595
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,140
但是
But?

596
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,270
Hollis Mann在哪儿
Where is Hollis Mann?

597
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,710
我 我觉得她回国防部了
I... I think she went back to the DoD.

598
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,050
你觉得
You think?

599
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,650
你"觉得"是什么意思
What do you... what do you mean... you think?

600
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,980
呃
Uh...

601
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,420
我们忙了一整晚
We've been at this all night.

602
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,430
我们都有点累了 不如大家休息一下
Uh, we're all a little tired-- why don't we take a break,

603
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,560
-透透气去吧 -不 不准休息
- get some air? - No, there is no break.

604
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,350
案子结束前 谁也不许休息
There's no breaks until this case breaks.

605
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,690
"办案时切忌掺杂个人感情"
Never get personally involved in a case--

606
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,430
你违反了第十条规则 老大
you're breaking rule number ten, boss.

607
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,860
你特么真说对了DiNozzo 你有意见么
You're damn right I am, DiNozzo. Do you have a problem with that?

608
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,200
老大
Boss...

609
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,020
呃 老大
Uh, boss?

610
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,780
这就是你说的
Is this what you meant

611
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,030
让我相信你么 Gibbs探员
when you said trust you, Agent Gibbs?

612
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,780
-我们与此事无关 -他们在
- Our office had nothing to do with that. They're dragging Eric's name

613
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,480
玷污Eric的声誉 这正是我所担忧的
through the mud-- it is exactly what I was afraid would happen.

614
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,710
我们还是去会议室说吧
Why don't we take this to the conference room?

615
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,260
不不不
No, no, no.

616
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,950
没什么可说的
There's nothing to talk about.

617
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
覆水难收
The damage is already done.

618
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,560
我还以为你会说话算话
I thought you were a man of honor.

619
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,130
你真是骗到我了
You got me.

620
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,750
嘿 不过是死个基佬水手嘛 对吧
Hey, but what's one dead gay sailor, right?

621
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,340
噢不 可怜的Gibbs
Oh, no. Poor Gibbs.

622
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,930
也许我该去给他个拥抱
Maybe I should go give him a hug.

623
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,800
我想他更想要线索 Abby
I think he'd prefer a lead, Abby.

624
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,660
-那个我也能办到 -你从Kutzler的
- I can help with that, too. - Did you get anything

625
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,090
GPS系统里发现什么了吗
from Kutzler's GPS system?

626
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,640
没错
I did.

627
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,070
Kutzler被杀当晚
So, Kutzler did

628
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,140
的确离开过住处
leave his house the night of the murder,

629
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,140
但他没有使用车辆导航功能
but he didn't use his vehicle's navigation function.

630
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,980
不过这款GPS软件
Turns out this particular software,

631
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,480
每小时都会接收卫星定位更新
it receives hourly satellite updates

632
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,180
并生成相应记录
and it generates a log.

633
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,590
在8点45分 更新记录显示
At 8:45, the update places

634
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,990
Kutzler的车辆停在住处
Kutzler's vehicle at his residence.

635
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,050
9点45分和10点45分
At 9:45 and 10:45,

636
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,040
他在马里兰州的伯温
he's at a location in Berwyn, Maryland.

637
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,800
然后11点45分 他又回到了住处
And at 11:45, he's back at his house.

638
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,520
马里兰州的哪里
What's the location in Maryland?

639
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,970
伯温社区
The Berwyn Community

640
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,510
-服务中心 -太棒了 谢谢你 Abby
- Outreach Center. - Excellent. Thank you, Abby.

641
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,140
打扰了
Excuse me.

642
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,810
天使降临
Bestow an angel!

643
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,890
你叫什么名字 靓眼妞
What's your name, bright eyes?

644
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,150
她是特别探员Bishop
She's Special Agent Bishop.

645
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,180
我是特别探员DiNozzo
I'm Special Agent DiNozzo.

646
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,220
你叫Mat
"Mat."

647
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,770
漏了个T吧 伙计
You're missing a "T" there, buddy.

648
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,770
{\a6}通常写做Matt

649
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,510
像doormat[门垫]的那个"mat"么
Like "doormat"?

650
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,550
我几年前就把第二个T丢掉了
I dropped the second "T" years ago. Life's not about

651
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,600
生活不是用来遵循男权社会常规的
conforming to society's phallocentric norms.

652
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,350
来点自制无谷肉桂素食饼干吧
Homemade gluten-free vegan cinnamon scone?

653
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,000
唔
Ooh.

654
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,240
不行
No.

655
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,720
你疯了么
Are you nuts?

656
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,570
永远不要接受嬉皮士的饼干或电影建议
Never take cookies or movie advice from a hipster.

657
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,950
前面有两个人
Two guys out front

658
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,770
认出了Kutzler的照片
both recognize Kutzler's photo.

659
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,060
说他是个常客
They said he's a regular.

660
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,280
我问你 门垫兄
Let me ask you, Doormat,

661
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,640
你和你的非处方眼镜
have you and your nonprescription glasses

662
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,980
见过这家伙吗
seen this guy?

663
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,780
呃 当然 我认识这张脸
Uh... sure. I know the face.

664
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,290
他参加我们晚间九点半的集会
He attends our nightly 9:30 meeting.

665
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,370
什么集会
Meeting for what?

666
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,890
匿名戒瘾互助会
Addictions Anonymous.

667
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,790
不过从周日晚开始 我就没见过他了
I haven't seen him since Sunday night, though.

668
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,040
他离开时挺生气的样子
He was pretty heated when he left.

669
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,480
怎么个生气法
Define "heated."

670
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,880
我在停车场里
Uh, I saw him out in the parking lot

671
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
看见他和组里另一个人
with some guy from his group.

672
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,960
他们在喊什么 我不知道
They were... yelling about something-- I don't know, I...

673
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,420
我尽量不管别人的事
I try to mind my own business.

674
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,040
另外那个人叫什么名字
This other guy have a name?

675
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,780
我们这儿可不会关注
Well, we're not exactly following each other's

676
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,300
大家的社交账号
Instagram accounts around here.

677
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,680
毕竟是匿名互助
It's Addictions Anonymous.

678
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,860
抱歉
Excuse me.

679
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,240
讲不通啊
Doesn't make any sense.

680
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,620
Kutzler又不是瘾君子
Kutzler wasn't an addict.

681
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,960
他为什么要来参加这种集会
Why would he attend these meetings?

682
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,150
而且他为什么要随身携带
And why would he be carrying around

683
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,200
非法麻醉品
a stash of illegal narcotics?

684
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,820
他用的是Badger那一招
He's pulling a Badger.

685
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,400
{\a6}Badger是《绝命毒师》中的一个配角 在剧中曾试图把毒品卖给A.A.集会中的瘾君子

686
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,400
把毒品卖给康复中的瘾君子们
He's selling narcotics to recovering addicts.

687
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,230
就像瓮中捉鳖
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

688
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,630
只不过这次鳖反咬了一口
Except this time the fish shot back.

689
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,500
也许就是和Kutzler争吵的那位
Maybe the one Kutzler was arguing with.

690
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,100
如果神秘男回来的话 可以让Mat通知我们
We could ask Mat to call us if our mystery man comes back.

691
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,520
你想去告诉Gibbs 我们没有任何发现
You want to be the one to tell Gibbs we got nothing?

692
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,490
好吧 说得对
All right. Good point.

693
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,990
你知道这意味着什么吗
Well, you know what this means.

694
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,390
监视
Stakeout.

695
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,580
这是杯不附带任何条件的咖啡 Jethro
It's a no-strings-attached cup of coffee, Jethro.

696
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,640
我在餐厅买的
I got it at the diner,

697
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,070
所以拿着吧
so take it.

698
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,430
好点儿么
Is that better?

699
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,500
没有
No.

700
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,260
这个也许有用
Well, this might help.

701
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,620
Davis Riley说的是实话
Davis Riley was telling the truth.

702
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,950
2012年 Kutzler确实被提名获得荣誉勋章
Kutzler was submitted for the Medal of Honor back in 2012.

703
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,170
而且表彰申请并非不小心丢失
And his packet didn't just slip through the cracks.

704
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,070
是有人给藏起来了
Someone buried it.

705
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,150
所以我调查了一下
So I did some digging...

706
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,960
找到了一个熟悉的名字
and I found a familiar name.

707
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,370
你不会真的在指控我
You're not seriously accusing me of having something to do

708
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,460
跟Kutzler上尉之死有关吧
with Lieutenant Kutzler's death?

709
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,570
不不
No, no.

710
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,250
我们核实过你的不在场证明 非常可靠
We checked your alibi, and it's rock solid.

711
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,070
很高兴我们说清楚了 我可以走了么
Well, I'm glad we cleared that up. Am I free to go now?

712
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,230
不行
No.

713
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,960
你还不能走 坐下
You're not free to go. Sit down.

714
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,910
注意你的语气 Gibbs探员
I'd watch your tone, Agent Gibbs.

715
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,520
我不认为海军部长会允许NCIS
I don't think SECNAV would appreciate

716
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,810
像对待罪犯一样对待一位将军
NCIS treating an admiral like a criminal.

717
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,320
噢 我们已经和海军部长谈过了
Oh, we already talked to SECNAV.

718
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,570
她怎么说的来着
How did she phrase it?

719
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,970
"拿下那混蛋"
Uh, "nail the son of a bitch."

720
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,840
为了什么
For what?

721
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,760
毙了Kutzler上尉的
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's

722
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,560
第一次荣誉勋章提名
first Medal of Honor nomination.

723
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,440
我完全不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

724
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,490
2012年 那个表彰申请
The packet was routed through your chain of command

725
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,410
经过你的管理层 少将
in 2012, Admiral.

726
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,960
那肯定是在到我手里之前
Then it must have got lost in the shuffle

727
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,640
就在混乱中丢失了
before it reached my desk.

728
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,980
因为我根本没收到
Because it never did.

729
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,410
不过我向你们保证
And I assure you,

730
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,520
我一定会追查此事
I will look into it.

731
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,480
噢不用了 我们已经查过了
Oh, no, we already did.

732
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,720
我们给驻扎在阿富汗的
Yeah, we put in a call

733
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,800
美国驻军办事处打了个电话
to the U.S. forces in Afghanistan,

734
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,990
跟当初派至你办公室的文书官员谈了一下
spoke to the yeoman who was assigned to your desk,

735
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,080
他把你收到的所有文件都记录在案
who cataloged all your incoming routing sheets.

736
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,910
没错 这儿呢 "标题
And yes, here it is. "Subject:

737
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,470
Eric James Kutzler上尉的
"Medal of Honor awards packet

738
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,060
荣誉勋章提名申请
"for one Lieutenant Eric James Kutzler.

739
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,130
送至Xavier Meade少将办公室"
Delivered to the office of Admiral Xavier Meade."

740
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,940
2012年11月1日
November 1, 2012.

741
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,280
要让这文件消失轻而易举 没人在追踪它
Easy enough to make that disappear-- no one was tracking it.

742
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,230
没错 但后来Gundersen议员的提名就来了
Oh, yeah, but then Senator Gundersen comes along with her nomination.

743
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,170
你这次没法掩盖掉了
I mean, you couldn't very well bury it again.

744
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,320
那么多双政客的眼睛盯着呢
Not with so many political eyes on it.

745
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,660
你对自己的手下背后捅刀子 就因为他是同性恋
You sandbagged your own officer because he was gay.

746
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,210
Kutzler不是我手下
Kutzler's not the only homosexual

747
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,130
唯一的同性恋
I've had in my command.

748
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,200
士兵的私生活是他们自己的事
My sailors' personal lives are their own business.

749
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,010
我只在乎
All I care about

750
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,560
他们努力工作
is that they do their jobs.

751
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,120
是啊 而你确保他们不会成功
Yeah, a job you made sure they don't succeed at.

752
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,070
从2011年开始 你给手下
Since 2011, you've given subpar FITREP scores

753
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,160
每一个出柜的士兵的评估报告
to every openly gay sailor

754
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,860
都打了超低的分数

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,650
你篡改
You tampered

政府正式文件
with official government documents.

759
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,180
你妨碍犯罪调查
You interfered with a criminal investigation.

760
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,320
我什么也不说了 我要律师
I'm not saying another word. I want a lawyer.

761
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,710

Kutzler上尉就是那样的人
That's who Lieutenant Kutzler was.

765
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,200
你侮辱了这身军装
You're a disgrace to that uniform.

766
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,600
我期待在你的军事法庭上作证

767

那是黄夹克的第五支烟了

768
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,960
我再也受不了了
I can't take it much more.

769
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,680
你该看看McGee收集的烟斗
You should see McGee's pipe collection.

770
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,230
我用它们来进行创意
I only use those for creative purposes.

771
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,320

Is that... Davis Riley?

772
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,870
当然 我猜Riley忘了说
Sure is. Guess Riley forgot to mention

他和Kutzler参加同一个匿名戒瘾互助集会

775

786
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,610

Bishop, call 911!

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,950
听说你又回来造船了
Heard you were back building boats.

791
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,060
打算给这艘起什么名字
What are you gonna name this one?

792
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,370
我不会走的 Jethro
I'm not leaving, Jethro.

793
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,090
除非你跟我聊聊
Not until you talk to me.

794
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,860
聊什么
Talk about what?

795

你自己 你最不喜欢的话题
You. Your least favorite topic.

-不 我很好 -别跟我说你很好
- No, I'm-I'm doing fine. - Don't tell me you're fine.

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,760
我知道你不好
I know you're not.

798
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,600
Hollis
Hollis,

799
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,740

Diane之死都是你的错
It's your fault Diane's dead.

801
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,210
你就是这么想的
That's what you're thinking.

802
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,760
我没错
I'm not wrong.

803
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,420
不是你开的枪
You didn't pull the trigger.

804
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,790
我把她暴露在危险下
I put her in the crosshairs.

805
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,730
他那是就想针对我
He wanted to make it personal!

806
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,800
现在仍然是
Still does.

807
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
我正在想办法
I'm figuring it out.

808
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,140
但你在我身边 会让你也变成他的目标
But you being around me makes you a target.

809
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,080
所以你才赶我走
So that's why you're shutting me out?

810
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,610
-为了保护我 -我不需要你卷入这事
- To protect me? - I don't need you mixed up in this.

811
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,310
我不需要你和我卷在一起
I don't need you mixed up in me!

812
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,800
这事儿你说了不算
It's not your call.

813
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,050
我愿意冒这个风险
I'll take my chances.

814
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,380
我可以照顾自己
I can handle myself.

815
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,190
嗯
Hmm?

816
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,960
收到
Copy that.

817
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,280
不 我不会让你
No, I'm not

818
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,000
这么容易解脱的
letting you off that easy.

819
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,090
那次伏击之后
After the ambush,

820
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,330
大家一直说 我活下来有多幸运
people kept telling me how lucky I was to be alive.

821
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,500
可事实是 死亡轻松多了
The truth is, death would have been so much easier.

822
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,390
反而
Instead,

823
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,170
我每天都在重温
I relive that awful day

824
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,230
那可怕的一天
every single day.

825
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,150
我看着我的朋友 死了一次又一次
I see my friends die again and again.

826
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,180
而那颗该死的手榴弹...
And that damn grenade...

827
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,480
Kutzler扑上去的时候
I just stood there, frozen,

828
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,980
我就站在那儿 僵住了
while Kutzler threw himself over it.

829
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,620
我还能听见爆炸的声音
I can still hear the sound as it went off

830
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,490
还有对他造成的伤害
and the damage that it did to him.

831
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,870
我忘不掉那个画面
I can't get that image out of my head.

832
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,180
所以你开始吸毒
That's why you started using?

833
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,830
我只是想忘记
I just wanted to forget.

834
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,080
Kutzler是怎么卷进来的
How was Kutzler involved?

835
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,160
他...看到了情况有多糟
He... saw how bad it got

836
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,380
就介入了
and stepped in.

837
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,440
他让我加入了戒毒计划
He got me in the program,

838
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
跟我一起去集会
went with me to meetings.

839
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,650
他再一次救了我的命
He saved my life a second time.

840
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
你什么时候复吸的
When did you relapse?

841
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,380
三天前
Three days ago.

842
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,540
我没去参加小组讨论
When I didn't show up to the group session,

843
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,080
Kutzler就来到我的公寓
Kutzler came to my apartment,

844
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,570
然后...
and, uh...

845
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,130
他看见我磕高了
he saw that I was high.

846
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,320
我只记得他很生气
All I really remember is that he was angry.

847
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,510
他拿走我的存货 破门而出
He took my stash and stormed out.

848
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,600
GPS显示 那晚他在社区中心
GPS puts him at the community center later that night.

849
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,720
他为什么回去
Why'd he go back?

850
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,530
我一定是告诉了他 毒品是谁给的
I must have told him who I got the drugs from.

851
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,960
Eric很可能是去找他对质
Eric probably went there to confront him.

852
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,320
是谁
Who's that?

853
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,520
前台那家伙
The guy at the front desk.

854
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,710
Mat Jebson
Mat Jebson.

855
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,780
你不是认真的吧
You're not serious.

856
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,730
我非常认真 我发誓 嘿 Mat
I'm totally serious. I swear. Hey, Mat.

857
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,210
Mat你好么 哥们

858
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,960

Bishop was just telling me this story.

859

It is hilarious, and you're gonna get

860
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,600
-喜欢的 告诉他 -是这样的
- a kick out of it. Tell him. - So,

861
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,410
我和McGee探员搜查了你的公寓
Agent McGee and I were searching your apartment,

862
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,900
我们发现了你的临时毒品实验室
and we found your makeshift drug lab,

863
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,980
以及上百小瓶的吗啡和芬太尼
along with hundreds of vials of morphine and fentanyl,

864
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,230
就像这个
just... like this.

865
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
搞笑吧 我们是这么想的
Hilarious, right? So here's what we think happened.

866
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,920
Riley把你贩毒给中心瘾君子的事
Riley spills the beans about you selling drugs

867
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,350
说漏了嘴
to addicts at the center.

868
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,340
Kutzler威胁要告发你
Kutzler threatens to turn you in,

869
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,860
所以你跟踪他回家 并朝他开了三枪
so you follow him home and put three rounds in him.

870
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,360
我说对了么
Am I right?

871
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,110
你利用需要帮助的人来赚钱
You made money exploiting people who needed help.

872
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,690
找这个么
Looking for this?

873
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,100
已经搜查过你的车了
Already searched your trunk.

874
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,940
发现一把带消音器的点22口径手枪
Found a .22 with a silencer.

875
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,710
嘿 这和杀害Kutzler上尉的枪是不是同一把
Hey, isn't that the same weapon used to kill Lieutenant Kutzler?

876
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,860
是的 完全正确
Yes, it certainly is.

877
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,780
剧透一下 Heisenberg
Spoiler alert, Heisenberg,

878
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,780
{\a6}《绝命毒师》中制毒男主给自己起的名字

879
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,640
你的结局并不好
it doesn't end well for you.

880
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,230
我想为那天说的话道歉
I want to apologize for what I said the other day.

881
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,960
我太过分了
I was out of line.

882
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,320
Eric的名声被澄清了 凶手也被绳之以法
Eric's name was cleared, his killer brought to justice.

883
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,310
这是最重要的
That's all that matters.

884
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,700
他的荣誉勋章提名
His, um, Medal of Honor nomination would have never

885
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,910
离不开你的帮助 Gibbs探员
been endorsed without your help, Agent Gibbs.

886
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,230
谢谢你 真心感谢
Thank you, sincerely.

887
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,280
什么时候出结果
When's it official?

888
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,440
白宫应该会在几天后发出声明
The White House should be making an announcement in a few days.

889
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,540
英雄终于得到他应得的
A hero finally gets his due.

890
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,930
要知道 Eric从没把自己当英雄看
You know, Eric never saw himself as a hero.

891
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,920
他常来这里 怀念他的战友
He would often come here to remember his men,

892
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,530
那些他没能救下的战友
the ones he couldn't save.

893
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,070
他说 不忘记他们的牺牲 是他的责任
Said it was his duty to never forget their sacrifice.

894
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,870
这是他纪念他们的方式
That's how he chose to honor them.

895
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,510
我也会找个方式来纪念他
I'll have to find a way to do the same for him.

896
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,510
继续他的遗愿
Continue his legacy.

897
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,410
你丈夫过世时 和他在阿富汗做的是同样的事
Your husband died doing the same thing he did in Afghanistan,

898
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,390
为拯救朋友性命而战
fighting to save a friend's life.

899
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,320
他不会落下任何一个人
He wouldn't leave a man behind.

900
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,970
完成这项任务
Finish the mission.

901
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,420

{\a6}背景音乐 <Going Home> by Randall Kent

903
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,010

What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

905
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,640
太好啦
Yay.

906
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,480
我从没想过会发生这种事
I never meant for any of this to happen.

907
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,860
