00:31:57,990 > 00:32:01,060
他这么对待女人 怎么还这么受欢迎?
Where does he get off, treating women like that?

631
00:32:01,090 > 00:32:02,560
啊 我猜 他只是没有安全感
Ah, he's just insecure, I guess.

00:33:37,490 > 00:33:38,660
天哪 操 你吓到我了
Jesus, fuck, you scared me.

 关门了吗?  哦 是的

658
00:34:31,640 > 00:34:33,610
肯定是被卫生部门勒令停业什么的
By order of the health department, apparently.

659
00:34:33,650 > 00:34:35,280
咖啡怎么可能会有卫生安全问题
How do you make unhealthy coffee?

660
00:34:35,310 > 00:34:38,750
 或许是因为司康饼 嗯呣

还有连环强奸犯通缉单

676
00:35:18,560 > 00:35:21,960
好像一夜之间这附近变得一团糟

我无法言语 你丧失心智
I lost my voice, you lost your mind

712

不是我愿意的
That's not consent.

我以为你想要的
I thought it meant you wanted to.

我说了我想要吗?
Did I say I wanted to?

00:41:08,710 > 00:41:10,340
好像没有
Not exactly.

768
00:41:10,380 > 00:41:14,750
黛比 我当时几乎没有意识 好吗?
Debbie, I was barely conscious, okay?

769
00:41:14,780 > 00:41:16,550
是你设计强暴了我
You dateraped me.

不 黛比 你害你自己被强暴了

我可能会去坐牢
I could go to jail.

773
00:41:25,120 > 00:41:26,320
我不明白
I don't understand.

774
00:41:26,360 > 00:41:29,290
朋友才不会对朋友下手
Friends don't rape friends.

775
00:41:29,330 > 00:41:32,400
我 我不是故意的
II didn't mean to rape you.

唷 你说你会在四点前回家
Yo, you said you'd be home by 4:00.

780

说那话的时候我们在付账
Word got out that we're paying cash.

781
00:42:04,260 > 00:42:05,830
但又来了一些新的护理妈妈们
Bunch of new nursing moms just showed up.

782
00:42:05,860 > 00:42:08,800
嘿 拉达 我付你钱不是让你来打盹的
Hey, Radha! I'm not paying you to snooze.

783
00:42:08,830 > 00:42:10,200
等等 你觉得让
So wait. You got a problem

784
00:42:10,240 > 00:42:11,740
斯维特拉娜喂我们的孩子你不能接受
With Svetlana breastfeeding the girls,

785
00:42:11,770 > 00:42:14,640
却把这些人召集在一起
But selling this taintedass titty milk

训练成人工奶源?
From this crew's okay?

787
00:42:16,310 > 00:42:17,940
我们一定要想办法渡过难关
We're gonna be struggling just to make ends meet

788
00:42:17,980 > 00:42:19,180
因为我们的妓院被关闭了
With the rubntug closed.

789
00:42:19,210 > 00:42:20,710
你都没能抱着孩子们摇晃  凯文
 you missed the wiggles.  kev.

790
00:42:20,750 > 00:42:23,510
他们就喜欢被抱着摇晃 小维 她们需要她们的妈妈
They love the wiggles. V, they need their mother.

791
00:42:23,550 > 00:42:25,720
你为什么不能放轻松 让我来做我的工作?
Why don't you just relax and let me do my job?

792
00:42:25,750 > 00:42:28,190
因为这些奶你都用来喂其他孩子了
Because I see you feeding everybody else's babies,

793
00:42:28,220 > 00:42:32,260
而我们的孩子却没奶喂 这真的很让我窝火
Except your own, and it pisses me off!

794
00:42:42,200 > 00:42:43,970
嘿 小黛 你还好吧
Hey, debs, you okay?

 我们昨晚做爱了......   等等等等
 We made love last night...  no, wait, wait, wait.

798
00:42:49,270 > 00:42:51,240
你昨晚破处了吗?
You lost your virginity?

799
00:42:51,280 > 00:42:52,680
强奸的话 算吗?
Does it count if it's rape?

800
00:42:52,710 > 00:42:54,610
是你强奸他吗 是这样吗?
You did the raping, right?

801
00:42:54,650 > 00:42:57,650
是啊 他当时醉得不省人事 不过那玩意儿倒没醉
Well, he was drunk, but his thing wasn't.

802
00:42:57,680 > 00:42:59,450
你到底是怎么实施强奸的?
How do you rape a dude?

803
00:42:59,490 > 00:43:01,950
他因为喝了弗兰克的神之秘酿而酩酊大醉
He was sort of paralyzed by frank's beer or something.

804
00:43:01,990 > 00:43:04,390
我以为他喜欢这样呢 我以为每个男的都这样
I thought he would like it. I thought all guys did!

805
00:43:04,420 > 00:43:07,460
 我们...... 确实是喜欢这样  是吗 马蒂显然是例外
 we... we do.  well, matty didn't.

806
00:43:07,490 > 00:43:08,860
好吧 小黛 听着
Okay, listen, debs,

807
00:43:08,890 > 00:43:10,530
我觉得他是个很奇怪的人
I think this is one seriously weird dude, okay?

808
00:43:10,560 > 00:43:12,530
我觉得你摆脱他的话会更好的
I think you're better off without him, yeah?

809
00:43:12,560 > 00:43:14,670
不会好的
I'm not!

810
00:43:14,700 > 00:43:18,770
听着 小戴 肯定有成千上万的男人乐意被你强奸的
Listen, debs, a million guys would kill to be raped by you.

811
00:43:18,800 > 00:43:22,970
哦 请你闭嘴好吗?
Oh, would you shut up already?

812
00:43:23,010 > 00:43:27,110

我正在试驾我们的新家呢!

欧尼说服我买了辆大的!
Ernie talked me into the big one!

815
00:43:36,090 > 00:43:37,690
欧尼是谁?
Ernie?

Isn't it gorgeous?

818
00:43:42,330 > 00:43:45,330
而且在主卧室里还有块可以伸缩的区域
And in the master bedroom, there's a popout,

819
00:43:45,360 > 00:43:47,100
这样一来空间就显得更大了
And it just doubles the whole size.

820
00:43:47,130 > 00:43:49,130
 你已经买了吗  这个嘛
 you bought this?  well...

821
00:43:49,170 > 00:43:52,570
还没呢 不过欧尼说可以让我试驾一下
Not yet, but Ernie let me take it for a testdrive,

822
00:43:52,600 > 00:43:56,670
如果我决定要买的话他今晚就可以把车交给我们
And he said he'd bring it on back tonight if I buy it.

823
00:43:56,710 > 00:44:00,480
希拉听我说 我最近一直在考虑许多事情
Sheila, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

824
00:44:00,510 > 00:44:02,650
当我们结婚时我还处于神志不清的状态
I was unconscious when you married me.

825
00:44:02,680 > 00:44:06,120
 这个嘛 我是说......   过来说
 well, I mean...  all right.

826
00:44:06,150 > 00:44:07,720
 是有些不太清醒吧 但是...... 等等 听着......
 kind of, but...  wait, wait, listen...

827
00:44:07,750 > 00:44:09,450
 我是说 我了解你......  不 你听我说

828
00:44:09,490 > 00:44:11,420
我想......
I want...

829

我想重新做一次婚誓
I want to renew our vows.

830
00:44:13,560 > 00:44:15,530
 哦......   我想要让我们两厢情愿

831

让这份婚约变得更有价值
I want to do it right.

832
00:44:17,530 > 00:44:19,630
 真的吗?  哦天啊......

833
00:44:19,670 > 00:44:23,770
我感觉我心脏都要跳出来了 我以前还从没有过这感觉呢
My heart is literally bursting. I haven't felt this way ever.

834
00:44:23,800 > 00:44:28,670
不管是我和莫妮卡在一起时还是和萨米的母亲在一起时都没有过这感觉
I didn't feel it with Monica, not with Sammi's mom.

835
00:44:28,710 > 00:44:31,480
你有如此深沉的灵魂 如此具有关怀之心
You have such a deep soul, and you care so much.

836
00:44:31,510 > 00:44:36,450
你拥有十足的人性 但是我真的不能离开这里
You care about humanity, and I can't leave here.

837
00:44:36,480 > 00:44:39,480
我不能离开我的家
I can't leave my home.

838
00:44:39,520 > 00:44:42,550
不要让我们共同构建未来的梦想破灭
Don't squash my dream of us building a future together.

839
00:44:42,590 > 00:44:46,490
我不能接受 尤其是现在 我这么虚弱
I can't take it, especially now. I'm too weak.

840
00:44:46,530 > 00:44:50,360
可是弗兰克...... 我也有梦想啊
Frank... what about my dreams

841
00:44:50,400 > 00:44:54,230
我想开着这辆车去看 看这大千世界
Of seeing the world, in this... this?

842
00:44:54,270 > 00:44:57,740
我们可以随时去度假啊
We can take a vacation anytime you want.

843
00:44:57,770 > 00:44:59,800
然后呢......
And then...

844
00:44:59,840 > 00:45:01,510
我们就可以回家
We'll come back

845
00:45:01,540 > 00:45:04,080
回到我们精心编织的这个爱的小窝里
To the little nest that we've built for ourselves.

846
00:45:04,110 > 00:45:07,810
因为真的 我爱你 希拉杰克逊......

847
00:45:07,850 > 00:45:11,720
我是说 希拉加拉格  哦

848
00:45:11,750 > 00:45:15,020
哦 弗兰克
Oh, frank.

849
00:45:22,490 > 00:45:24,600
黛比 你在抽烟吗?
Debs, are you smoking?

850
00:45:24,630 > 00:45:28,400
 我只是点着了拿着而已  为什么这么做?
 I'm just holding it.  why?

851
00:45:28,430 > 00:45:31,000
我只是在尝试成年人的行为罢了
I'm experimenting with things adults do.

852
00:45:31,040 > 00:45:35,110
虽然不怎么喜欢
I don't like it very much.

853
00:45:35,140 > 00:45:37,640
你想要谈谈吗?
You need to talk?

854
00:45:40,250 > 00:45:41,510
我是想和你谈谈
I want to tell you something,

855
00:45:41,550 > 00:45:43,950
但又觉得有些说不出口
But I don't really want to talk about it

856
00:45:43,980 > 00:45:46,380
因为我都不知道我自己对这件事是怎么个感受
Because I'm not sure how I feel about it.

857
00:45:46,420 > 00:45:49,050
而且我不想让别人告诉我该怎样去感受
And I don't want to be told how to feel.

858
00:45:52,490 > 00:45:55,330
好吧
Okay.

859
00:45:55,360 > 00:45:59,700
既然如此的话
So I'm gonna tell you, and...

860
00:45:59,730 > 00:46:02,200
那我就说了
That's it.

861
00:46:02,230 > 00:46:05,100
好吗
Okay?

862
00:46:05,140 > 00:46:06,370
好的
Okay.

863
00:46:08,810 > 00:46:11,380
我昨晚与人做爱了......
I had sex last night...

864
00:46:11,410 > 00:46:14,280
我的第一次
My first time.

865

告诉我...... 有安全措施吗
Tell me... you were careful.

867
00:46:50,820 > 00:46:52,150
自制啤酒可以吗?
Homemade beer okay?

868
00:46:52,180 > 00:46:54,190
哦 我喝水就好 谢了
Oh, I'm fine with water. Thank you.

869
00:46:54,220 > 00:46:56,820
哦 好吧
Oh, okay.

870
00:46:59,020 > 00:47:02,430
呼

瞧瞧这袜子 哦
Look at those socks... oh.

哦 哦 嗯 听着 我真的喜欢你
Oh, oh, um, listen, look, II really like you.

875
00:47:26,850 > 00:47:30,050
你是个十足的绅士 这样的男人我真的很少遇到
You're a true gentleman, and I don't meet many of those,

876
00:47:30,090 > 00:47:32,260
所以......
Which is...

877
00:47:32,290 > 00:47:35,730
 我想要进展慢一些  啥?
 Why I want to take things slow.  Huh?

878
00:47:35,760 > 00:47:37,660
我以前与很多男人交往过程中犯了太多错误
I don't want to make the same mistakes that I have

879
00:47:37,700 > 00:47:42,430
我不想再犯相同的错误了
With the last 30 or 40 guys I've been with.

你说的 进展慢一些

Maybe later. Hey!

898
00:48:30,220 > 00:48:34,120
你为了得到酿啤酒的设备竟然让我去做性交易?
You dangled me like a sex carrot to get brewery equipment?

你不是说你寂寞吗 我不过是来了个一石二鸟而已
You were lonely. I was killing two birds with one stone.

愤怒的疯女妖般的女儿

另一边还有一个满身疙瘩 变态到窒息的老婆!

爸爸! 你敢再叫爸爸试试!

你又欲求不满 又骚成极致

你的儿子纯粹是痛苦的代名词

两年来你都无法走出家门一步

你很乐于把假阳具

938
00:50:10,980 > 00:50:13,020
推进你爱的男人的屁眼里

你收养了一大堆印第安小孩

你那没有道理又复杂不堪的厨艺

00:50:28,200 > 00:50:30,670
哦 上帝啊!
Oh, jesus christ!

945
00:50:30,700 > 00:50:34,000
一个人怎么就连一分钟的平静都得不到呢?
Can't a man get one fucking minute of peace?

946
00:50:34,040 > 00:50:36,370
就一分钟?
Just one minute?

947
00:50:38,340 > 00:50:39,680
我操啊
Holy shit!

948
00:50:39,710 > 00:50:41,380
一定是丙烷泄露了
Must've been the extra propane.

949
00:50:41,410 > 00:50:44,320
汉斯在哪儿?
Where's Hanzi?

妈妈说 妈妈说
Mama said, mama said

你要一门心思
You got a onetrack mind

964
00:51:37,140 > 00:51:40,770
但是你不会一次就能获得全部
But you ain't gonna get it all the time

965
00:51:40,810 > 00:51:42,670
她没有说谎
She wasn't lying

966
00:51:42,710 > 00:51:46,980
我从圣贝纳迪诺来到卡拉马祖
I went from san berdoo to kalamazoo

967
00:51:47,010 > 00:51:49,880
就是为了逃离你
Just to get away from you

968
00:51:49,920 > 00:51:52,950
至少我们不用为拆房子再花钱了
At least we won't have to pay for the demo.
