1
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,730
Come on, easy. Easy, girl. Easy.

2
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,730
Easy. Good. That'll do it.

3
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,670
Steady. Good girl.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,870
Steady.

5
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,480
Good girl! Good girl!

6
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,870
This is a stubborn one, huh?

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,350
Easy. Attagirl.

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,880
There we go.

9
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,620
Who's a clever girl, then?

10
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,340


11
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,600
Come on, boy. Come here.

12
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,460
Come on, boy.

13
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,340
Come on.

14
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,520
Come on. Easy does it, easy does it. Come on.

15
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,000
Steady there, boy. Steady, boy. That's it. Nice and done now, isn't it?

16
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,200


17
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,550
Morning, Pop.

18
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,420
Put your mark here.

19
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,890
Good luck.

20
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,760
Get the colt.

21
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,720
Easy. Hey.

22
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,800
Now that's a beauty.

23
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,730
Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred. Not got a day's work in him.

24
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,800
Now there...

25
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,800
There's your ticket.

26
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,140
But look at him, Si.

27
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
Look at that creature.

28
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,020
Don't be daft. You need something solid to plow a field.

29
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,030
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.

30
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,160
All right, ladies and gentlemen, settle down, settle down.

31
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,900
Horses on my right,

32
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,030
men with money in their pockets on my left.

33
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,160
lt's the perfect combination.

34
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,170
ls Fred Goddard here? Yes, l's here!

35
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,640
Good. More money than sense.

36
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,650
Dave Hill! l'm here, yes!

37
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,980
Bugger off, you tight bastard.

38
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,580
You've been coming here for 20 years, never bought so much as a pork scratching!

39
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,800


40
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,940
All right. First up today, a gorgeous young horse.

41
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,210
Prettiest young thing l've seen since my wife on our wedding day.

42
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,550
Let's get going, shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature?

43
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,550
One guinea!

44
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,620
One guinea. One guinea.

45
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,820
l thought you needed a plow horse, Mr. Narracott.

46
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,960
One guinea. Any advance on one guinea?

47
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,820
Two guineas! Two guineas.

48
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,890
Three guineas.

49
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,830
Ted Narracott, it's completely the wrong animal.

50
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,770
Si Easton, l'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.

51
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,240
Five guineas! Five guineas!

52
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,230
Six! Oh, for the love of...

53
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,170
Seven! Seven guineas.

54
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,980
Greedy sod. Thinks he can just buy anybody. Eight!

55
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,710
Stop it. He's your landlord. You can't be picking fights with him.

56
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,320
Ten guineas! Ten guineas.

57
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,580
You haven't got the money. Let's go home, let's have a pint.

58
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,850
Eleven guineas, sir! From as good a man as any in this town!

59
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,790
Do l hear 1 2 guineas? Twelve guineas.

60
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,930
That's top price for a working animal. Ted, save it for the shire!

61
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,070
There are big days and there are small days. Which will it be?

62
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,870
Do l hear any advance on 1 1 guineas?

63
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,010
Just let him go, Dad. l don't care for him. He's too jumpy.

64
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,880
Shall we say 25?

65
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,680
Twentyfive guineas. He's got you there. Nice try, Ted.

66
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,990
You were great, Mr. N. Gave him a run for his money.

67
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,290
Thirty!

68
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,620
Thirty guineas!

69
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,620
Thirty guineas.

70
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,820
Thirty guineas.

71
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,300
Going,

72
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,900
going,

73
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,300
gone! To Mr. Ted Narracott!

74
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,700
What have you done, Ted? What have you done?

75
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,990
Here you are, Ted.

76
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Quite a beast there. What are you gonna do with him on a working farm?

77
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,730
l hope you got the rent, Ted. l'll be around for it when it comes due.

78
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,200
You're a fool, Ted. And now Rosie will never forgive you.

79
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,770
What have you done? That's Mooney's colt.

80
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,210
You were supposed to buy a plow horse! You bought him?

81
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,840
What'd you pay for him?

82
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,440
How much, Ted Narracott?

83
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,380
l won't tell you a lie, though l would love to.

84
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,250
Thirty guineas!

85
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,850
Thirty guineas?

86
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,390
He's not worth 1 0! Are you out of your mind? What about the rent?

87
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,720
He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at the way he holds his head.

88
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,870
How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that?

89
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,505
Ted, you have to take him back. You have to take him back right now. 

90
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,970
You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.

91
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,270
No. No, please, don't take him back.

92
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,080
We can't take him back until he's broken in.

93
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,080
And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?

94
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,810
l'll train him.

95
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,420
You stay out of this, Albert. You don't know nothing about horses.

96
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,350
Please, Mum. Please, let me. l can do it.

97
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,430
We have to keep him. No choice.

98
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,330
Right. Well, you got one month to break him in, or l'm taking him back myself.

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,030
How'd you get to 30? What other fool bid you up that high?

100
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,300
lt was Lyons.

101
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,110
We're going to lose everything.

102
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,510
After all we've been through, we're going to lose it all.

103
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,530
Don't worry, Mum. l'll raise him. l'll raise him good.

104
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,800
Well, you better. Go on, get started!

105
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,800
See if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours.

106
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,060
Easy, boy. Easy. Easy.

107
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,970
Right.

108
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,910
Let's make a start then.

109
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,510
lt's oats.

110
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,860
Very tasty, that is. lt's beef and gravy to us.

111
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,190
Come on.

112
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,230
l'll bet you're missing your mother.

113
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,160
Look at you.

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,020
First time without your mum. 

115
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,430
First time away from home.

116
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
But you're not alone, are you?

117
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,170
ln fact.

118
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,040
Cause l'm here.

119
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,040
lt's all right.

120
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,650
All right.

121
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,320
l'm going to call you Joey. You understand?

122
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,590
Joey. That's you.

123
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,460
And l'm Albert.

124
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,070
lt's all right. You're mine now.

125
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,470
You're mine.

126
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,650
Good boy. Good boy.

127
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,170
Good boy. Come on.

128
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,390
l want you to stay there, Joey.

129
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,670
Stay.

130
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,600
That's it.

131
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,400
Good boy. That's it, you got it.

132
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,670
Hey, look at him, Albie!

133
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,410
He's playing Grandma's Footsteps!

134
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,540
All right. Come on, Joey. Back you go. Come on.

135
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,410
Come on. Back you go. You're all right.

136
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,420
That's it. Good boy. All right.

137
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,290
You got to stay there. You understand?

138
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,690
That's it. 

139
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,560
Good boy. 

140
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,620
Good boy.

141
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,370
You've got it.

142
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,160
Good boy.

143
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,170
Good boy.

144
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,170
Good.

145
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,570
Now call him. Whistle.

146
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,180
Come now, Joey.

147
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,450
Come on.

148
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,120
You can come now, Joey.

149
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,200
l don't think he fancies your owls. l read it in a story.

150
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,070
lt's how the lndians used to summon their horses.

151
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,740
Now, Joey, when l whistle,

152
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,470
 you've got to come. Understand?

153
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,210
My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him.

154
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,860
He used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and...

155
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
He's not a dog.

156
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,820
He's just puzzling it through.

157
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,450
Will you look at you!

158
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,850
Albie!

159
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,560
There's only 1 5 here.

160
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,840
The rest will come.

161
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,440
You know by rights l could take this farm back today, don't you?

162
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,440
And l'm a great believer in my rights.

163
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,640
lt will come.

164
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,920
lf you drank less beer and bought fewer horses,

165
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,980
you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.

166
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,460
l said l'll pay you. We're going to plant the bottom field.

167
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,790
The bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down there.

168
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,460
No. We're going to plow it.

169
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,460
Just give me till the autumn. l'll pay every penny l owe you, with interest.

170
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,670
How are you going to plow it? Not with that fancy animal of yours.

171
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,470
He'll do it.

172
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,510
You'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow, even drunk on a Tuesday night. You know that.

173
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,750
And l can't wait for the money, there's a war coming.

174
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,620
l promise you that field will be plowed.

175
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,620
We'll plant it with turnips.

176
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,900
The money will be yours when harvest comes.

177
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,770
Please, sir. Please.

178
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,920
Very well.

179
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,050
lf that fancy plows that field,

180
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,520
l'll give you till October to set things straight.

181
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,060
What if he doesn't?

182
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,930
l'll take the horse on the day he fails.

183
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,070
And l'll take your father's farm, and give it to working men who can

184
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,470
hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company.

185
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,810
No, please. Sir, you can't do that.

186
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,420
Now, now, lad. What? Are you bladdered as well?

187
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,540
Ted Narracott,

188
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,820
 l've got you down in my book.

189
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,000
You can't harness him. He's got to be collared.

190
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,440
You're scaring him, Dad! You're scaring him.

191
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,910
He can't take a plow! He's got to plow!

192
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,010
He won't be able to do it!

193
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,080
He's too young. He's not even been backed yet!

194
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,180


195
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,490
lt's all right, boy. lt's all right.

196
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,030
 lt's all right. lt's all right.

197
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,160
l knew this would happen as soon as l laid eyes on him.

198
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,890
Ted, no.

199
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,900
Ted, no!

200
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,130
He's worth nothing to me. lf he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!

201
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,170
Dad? Move aside.

202
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,630
Dad, stop!

203
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,180
You shoot that horse, we have nothing.

204
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,780
No!

205
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,650
You were right what you said, Dad.

206
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,520
He'll do it.

207
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,930
You told Lyons he'll plow that field, and he will.

208
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,720
You'll see.

209
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,930
He'll show you.

210
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,200
We'll show you.

211
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,530
We'll get it done.

212
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,270
Let go.

213
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,810
Let go.

214
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,140
Go back to the house.

215
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,090
Some days are best forgotten. Today ain't one of them. Come on.

216
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,590
How are you today, Joey?

217
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,590
l don't know much about life, boy,

218
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,130
but l do know that there are big days and there are small days.

219
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,870
Most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone.

220
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,010
But this...

221
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,610
Well, this is a big one.

222
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,080
This is our big day!

223
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,020
lt's cold out there, so l'm going to take this off.

224
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,280
lf it's tough for you, it should be tough for me, too.

225
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,900
Now, l'm going to teach you how to plow.

226
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,030
And you're going to learn. ls that understood?

227
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,700
Then we can be together, which is how l believe things are meant to be.

228
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,640
Steady, boy.

229
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,780
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

230
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,310
Come on. Come on.

231
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,320
Now, boy. Easy. Easy.

232
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,190
Look at me, Joey.

233
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,060
See?

234
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,190
See?

235
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,070
You just got to put your nose through.

236
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,940
That's it.

237
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,950
See, you've got it. You've got it.

238
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,350
Good boy.

239
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,810
There.

240
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,050
Too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots.

241
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,850
Even a sturdy plow horse would never manage it alone.

242
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,450
Yet he will, l say.

243
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,920
You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert told you so.

244
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,930
lt's a fine thing, loyal to your mate, even if he is a bit barmy.

245
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,390
A team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.

246
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,950
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?

247
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,750
Of course he's watching.

248
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,490
Come on.

249
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,760
Come on.

250
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,350
Well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted. Picture of his father, he is.

251
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,520
Not a dollop of ordinary sense, but that thick stubbornness

252
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,190
that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.

253
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,330
Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among them,

254
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,110
leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stony patch of unpromising ground.

255
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,080
You've fettle enough for 20 men.

256
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,820
But with a gimpy leg and the drinking For the pain, isn't it, that you drink?

257
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,480


258
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,830
None of us could have anticipated an ending better than this.

259
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:43,100
Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place,

260
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,300
not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours.

261
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,840
Thought you were a spark, she did!

262
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,910
And now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.

263
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,850
See, Joey?

264
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,990
l got the collar, too!

265
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,260
Okay, come on, boy.

266
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Walk on. That's it.

267
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,990
Walk on!

268
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,990
Walk on, Joey.

269
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
Come on, boy, walk on!

270
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,880
You'd be better off standing at the top of the hill and going down!

271
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,950
Gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad!

272
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,410
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!

273
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,890
Come on, Joey, walk on.

274
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,150
Walk on, boy.

275
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,950
Walk on. Come on, walk on.

276
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,160
lt'll take the whip to move him.

277
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,590
Bravo! You reached the top of the hill! Off you go again, boy!

278
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,930
You'll make even better time coming down!

279
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,260
That's the way. Now, come on, keep straight, boy. Good boy.

280
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,270
Keep straight. Good lad. Good lad. Now walk on. Good boy.

281
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,270
Good boy. Now come on, dig in!

282
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,270
Albie, we're all with you!

283
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,140
Come on, keep it straight, boy.

284
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,010
That's it, walk on. Walk on.

285
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,080
Look, look, the plow hasn't even cut yet.

286
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,160
Do you know, l believe we can do it, Joey.

287
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,090
l knew when l first saw you that you'd be the best of us.

288
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,560
That's why he bought you.

289
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,430
He knows you have all the courage he never had.

290
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,370
l knew when l first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us!

291
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,450


292
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,040
You've got no chance, lad.

293
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,190
He'll not turn over half an acre. Give it up now.

294
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,320
You've done well. You've tried hard. You're more of a man than your father.

295
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,190
Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it?

296
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,730
Well, he'll destroy that horse.

297
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,340
l'll be over Thursday.

298
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,480
Give you a day to close it up.

299
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,150
Your wool.

300
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,620
l'm sorry, Rosie.

301
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,780
Now, boy!

302
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
You've got to do it, Joey!

303
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,750
You don't know, so l'm going to have to do the knowing for you. The rest of our lives depend on this!

304
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,250
So get set to pull! And pull straight! And pull hard!

305
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,130
Now, boy! Go!

306
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,390
Walk on, Joey, walk on! That's it!

307
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,400
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

308
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,540
Walk on! Walk on!

309
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,270
 Walk on! Walk on, Joey!

310
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,820
Go on, walk on! That's it. Walk on. Walk on.

311
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,390
Go around it!

312
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,890
Whoa, Joey!

313
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,700
Whoa, Joey! Joey!

314
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,170
Joey! Whoa! Whoa!

315
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,840
Joey, stop, you'll break the blade!

316
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,710
Will you look at you!

317
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,710
Mum, Dad! Come and look!

318
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,450
He's doing it!

319
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,740
Good lad, Albie!

320
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,340
Albert, well done!

321
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,470
l wouldn't have believed it!

322
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,240
l'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade.

323
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,590
He could lose a foot.

324
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:10,730
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son!

325
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,750
Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm!

326
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,900
Come on, Albie! Push on through!

327
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,610
Get it done, Albie! Get it done.

328
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,700
Albie, are you all right?

329
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,420
Are you all right?

330
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,830
Up you get.

331
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,300
My pair of fools. My mighty fools.

332
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,320
You're as battered and bloodied as he is.

333
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,870
Where's Dad? Still in the bottom field.

334
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,530
Stumbling about, l suppose.

335
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,470
lt's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble.

336
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,870
He drinks, Mum! So might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen.

337
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,810
He don't talk to me about it.

338
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,680
He don't talk about it 'cause he can't. There aren't words for some things.

339
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,880
Come here.

340
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,900
The mice have been at it.

341
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,970
Sit down.

342
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,670


343
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,040
lt's his campaign pennant.

344
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,040
He were Sergeant, 7th Battalion, lmperial Yeomanry.

345
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,320
And that is the Queen's South Africa Medal.

346
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,380
Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those.

347
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,380
And this...

348
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
That's the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

349
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,470
Not Dad's? Well, it isn't mine, dear.

350
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,940
He got that after the fighting at Transvaal.

351
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,910
After he'd been hurt and he'd saved some other lads, and, well, l don't know what else.

352
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,670
He won't tell me, either.

353
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,070
But the first day he got home, he just tossed them out.

354
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,520
First day he could walk, he threw them straight in the dustbin and wouldn't hear a word l said not to.

355
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,890
See, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now,

356
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,430
and so you should be, my splendid boy.

357
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,100
lt's good to be proud when you've done something good.

358
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,770
But what he done in Africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.

359
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,630
Hard as it surely was and however much pain it's cost him,

360
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,970
he refuses to be proud of killing, l suppose.

361
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,840
l'd be proud.

362
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,710
lf l'd gone off to war, if l'd gone and saved my mates...

363
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,780
Whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him, think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.

364
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:08,030
Your dad makes mistakes, and he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made,

365
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,190
but he never gave up.

366
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,730
And he does that for us.

367
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,540
And today, you showed the world it's all been worth it.

368
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,140
You keep looking after Joey, and he'll always be looking after you.

369
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,750
''Sergeant, 7th Battalion, lmperial Yeomanry.''

370
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,890
You see this, Joey?

371
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,750
lt's been through an entire war.

372
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,700
l'm not stealing it.

373
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,690
l'll give it back to him someday.

374
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,650
l'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me. That's right, and this is my dad's car.

375
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,050
You're lucky that you're in it。 l'm not normally allowed to drive it 'cause it's so...

376
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,020
ls he a friend of yours?

377
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,980
Come on, boy. Let's show her how to fly!

378
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,070
Well, you're clearly not going to be a jumper.

379
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,440
Shoo, Harold!

380
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,640
We can try planting something else.

381
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,590
Or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.

382
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,120
How else are we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent?

383
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,280
What are we going to do?

384
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,610
l used to believe

385
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,950
 that God

386
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,280
gave each man his fair portion of bad luck.

387
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,960
l don't feel that anymore. l've had more than my share.

388
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,440
You'll stop loving me, Rose, and l won't blame you when you do.

389
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,100
Well, l might hate you more,

390
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,970
but l'll never love you less.

391
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,520
lt's war!

392
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,660
We are at war with Germany!

393
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,130
You hear? England is at war with Germany!

394
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,270
They're going to ring the bells at 6:00,

395
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,280
and then never ring them again until the war is over.

396
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,690
Look smart, Joey lad! lt's the Tavistock Fair!

397
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,630
What has he done with him?

398
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,590
First name, middle name, last. Sign.

399
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,190
Last name first. First name, middle name, last.

400
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,720
Take my word for it, finest horse in the parish.

401
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,130
Goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine.

402
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:53,400
No curbs, no splints. Good feet and teeth. He's as sound as a bell, sir.

403
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,600
And how much are you charging, sir,

404
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,070
for this strong, decent, and very fine animal?

405
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,610
Forty.

406
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,350
l'll give you 20 and not a penny more.

407
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,490
Twenty's no good to me, Captain. Thirtyfive and he's yours.

408
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,820
l don't even know how he rides.

409
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,090
Oh, he rides. Splendidly.

410
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,090
You'll be astonished, l promise you that.

411
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,830
Finest horse in all of Devon.

412
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,230
Finest horse l've ever seen.

413
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,170
Thank you.

414
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,110
You can't.

415
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,250
You can't. He's mine.

416
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,190
l trained him. Albert.

417
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,850
You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

418
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,200
l'm afraid it's too late, lad. l've just paid 30 guineas for him.

419
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,260
Please. l'll get you money.

420
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,270
l will, l'll get you money. l'll work for it.

421
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,270
l'll work for it.

422
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,810
He won't obey anyone else.

423
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,820
He won't be any good in the war neither. He shies at every sound.

424
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,690
l'm sorry.

425
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,830
Well, if Joey's going, l'm going, too. l'm volunteering.

426
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,820
l see. What's your name, lad? Albert, sir.

427
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,760
And how old are you, Albert? Nineteen, sir.

428
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,990
ls that the truth?

429
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,330
 No, sir, but l look 1 9

430
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,670
and l'm bigger than most 1 9yearolds, and l'm strong, sir, and l'm not afraid of anything.

431
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,810
l don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering.

432
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,650
Your father's done what he had to do, you know that.

433
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,320
Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse

434
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,250
as fine as your Joey, l know that.

435
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,190
But it's all l've got.

436
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,320
Will you lease him to me, Albert? To be my own mount?

437
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:05,570
l promise you, man to man, that l'll look after him as closely as you've done.

438
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,740
l'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him.

439
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,610
And if l can, l'll return him to your care.

440
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,620
Now say goodbye.

441
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,550
lt's all right.

442
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,620
All right, turn it in. That's enough. He's a horse, not a dog.

443
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,230
Now on your way. Come on!

444
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,910
Do you want to lose the farm? Rose?

445
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,910
lt's the way you did it.

446
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,250
But we're at war.

447
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,250
Aren't we just?

448
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,280
Joey.

449
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,830
l told you, sling your hook!

450
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,020
Let him be, Perkins.

451
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,830
This isn't the end. This isn't the end, my brother.

452
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,560
l, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again.

453
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,970
Wherever you are, l will find you, and l will bring you home.

454
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,590
Steady, steady. Steady now, come on!

455
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,730
Walk on! Walk on, come on! Get on!

456
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,750
Take good care of him. Yes, sir. l will.

457
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy. Easy.

458
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,640
Easy.

459
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,400
Steady, steady. Whoa, whoa, Joey!

460
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,400
Stop mucking about, you hear? You're in the army now, son.

461
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,930
Good boy. Good boy. Steady.

462
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,670
Steady, steady. Come on. Easy, come on.

463
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,070
Come on, around. Good boy.

464
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,810
Relax.

465
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,950
Easy, easy, back up!

466
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,420
Joey, meet Topthorn.

467
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,420
Topthorn, this is Joey.

468
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,420
Sort out who's in charge between the two of you. Do you hear?

469
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,760
lf you want to fight, get it over with 'cause once we're over there,

470
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,660
you're going to need everything you've got for Fritz.

471
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,430
Gently, Perkins. l don't want to sour him.

472
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,140
There'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about this one, either.

473
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,170
l understand that, Sergeant, but l want him fit and shining.

474
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,040
He's my horse.

475
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,440
Sir.

476
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,440
Easy, boy.

477
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,920
Scares the living daylights out of me.

478
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,720
Who? Perkins. Glad he's on our side.

479
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,720
Not bad. Not bad at all.

480
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,860
Still, not a patch on my Topthorn.

481
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,200
l wouldn't be so sure. l think he's got potential.

482
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,530
He's certainly got the bit between his teeth.

483
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,730
l actually think my Blenheim's faster than the pair of them.

484
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,740
Clear off.

485
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,140
All right, gentlemen, listen here.

486
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,880
Everything tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman,

487
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,550
from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of MarslaTour.

488
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,160
The first attack can and should be the decisive one. Perkins?

489
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,000
Yes, sir. No excuses, no mistakes. Every horse groomed and fit for presentation.

490
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,630
l want a full practice charge tomorrow. Sir.

491
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,640
l thought you two had bottled out.

492
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,070
As if.

493
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,680
All right, then. Let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we?

494
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,680
This is what quiet confidence looks like.

495
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,620
l'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.

496
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,890
Over to you, Captain Nicholls.

497
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,100
Draw swords!

498
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,570
Give point!

499
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,700
Charge!

500
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,590
Come on, Joey, l know you've got it. Come on, boy!

501
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,740
Come on, boy!

502
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,760
Nice of you to turn up.

503
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,030
He's got speed, l'll give him that. But has he got stamina?

504
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,030
He has everything.

505
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,650
What are you up to?

506
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,650
l'm writing a letter.

507
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,920
With a picture in it?

508
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,170
lt's to the boy who owned Joey. l want to show him how wonderful he's looking.

509
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,800
Before we take him across the Channel to face a million German guns.

510
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,270
Yes, before that.

511
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,650
4:00 a.m. start tomorrow, traveling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport detachment.

512
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:29,780
They need to be at the dock at 5:00 a.m. to check all the kit.

513
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,950
Battle orders, no polishing.

514
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,150
Buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons, let them all go dull.

515
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,830
l don't want anything to flash in the sun and give us away. Of course.

516
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,350
Charlie. Jamie.

517
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,360
Charlie.

518
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,700
What do you think of the new cap?

519
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,910
Silk lining. l quite like it.

520
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,840
l'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans.

521
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,450
Oh, l don't know about that. Think about it.

522
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,120
You're a Boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot,

523
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:11,090
and you thought, ''Good Lord, ''one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!''

524
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,460
You might shoot the other one instead.

525
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,390
Or alternatively think, ''l fancy that cap,'' and kill you first of all.

526
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,390
Hadn't thought of that.

527
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,880


528
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,605
That is our target,the German 11 th Division, at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the Menin Road.

530
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,080
We have been watching them, and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires.

531
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,010
Knock them out and we could slide in behind the German lines and come at them from the south at Geluveld.

532
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,040
Excellent.

533
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,450
Numbers? About 600, infantry.

534
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,950
Twice our size. Regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours.

535
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,620
And we have surprise on our side. But the sooner we move, the better.

536
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,820
We have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning.

537
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:23,500
Right. Good. So today it is. Charlie, tell the men.

538
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Salisbury formation? Salisbury formation. Charge through them and secure the ground behind.

539
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,200
The grass to the left is taller than we are, it's perfect cover.

540
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:34,310
Excellent work, Sergeant Major. Time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.

541
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,800
Thank you, Singh.

542
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,810
Jamie!

543
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,540
They have no idea we're coming.

544
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,080
Not having scruples, are you, Jim?

545
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,950
No, l understand the surprise is everything.

546
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,810
But if it must be done, let's do it quickly.

547
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,330
You all right, Charlie?

548
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,230
Never been better.

549
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,500
Literally. Never better.

550
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,510
Prepare to mount! Mount!

551
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,110
Prepare to mount!

552
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,840
Mount!

553
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,520
Thank you, Stanley.

554
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,920
Hey, Joey.

555
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,390
My bonny boy.

556
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,590
You're all right, aren't you, Joey?

557
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:07,420
Gentlemen, it is an honor to ride beside you.

558
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,430
Make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us.

559
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,910
Let every man make himself, his King, his country,

560
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,580
and his fallen comrades proud.

561
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,310
Be brave.

562
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,050
Fear God! Honor the King!

563
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,920
Fear God! Honor the King!

564
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,940
Draw swords!

565
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,340
Good luck, my friends.

566
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,950
Forward, to walk!

567
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,480
Walk, march!

568
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,220
Forward, to canter!

569
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,970
Canter, march!

571
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,270
Charge!

572
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,380
Burn the documents!

573
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,540
Pull him down!

574
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,570
What? Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended?

575
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,170
Look at yourself!

576
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,440
Who do you think you are?

577
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,910
Now come!

578
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,790
What do we do with the horses? lf they're injured, shoot them.

579
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,720
And the others, sir? The others you round up and take to base camp. They will pull guns.

580
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:17,260
You'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.Then shoot them also! 

581
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,070
Sir? Perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances, to get the injured men off the field.

582
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,950
Will they take the harness? l'd like to try, sir.

583
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,810
lt won't work. They're cavalry.

584
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,650
Let's try. You won't get the harness on.

585
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,120
Come on, Michael.

586
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,650
Easy now. Easy now, Englishman. Easy.

587
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,260
Easy. Easy. Easy.

588
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,590
Easy now.

589
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,800
Gunther.

590
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,440
lt's hopeless. We can't help them.

591
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,660
Well, well, look at you.

592
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:26,300
Whoever taught you this has just saved your life.

593
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,550
Hello, the farm!

594
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,680
Hello, Si Easton.

595
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,420
l was at the post office.

596
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:20,290
And while l was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel had come for Albert from the...

597
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,690
From the...

598
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,360
From over there. And l thought

599
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,630
l could go up that way in the morning, and here it is.

600
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,770
Who'd be sending me a parcel over there?

601
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,840
Well, open it and see.

602
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,450
lt's a sketchbook.

603
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,260
lt's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!

604
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,660
See that? That's a picture of Joey!

605
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,730
lt's a picture of Joey.

606
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,660
Well, l never!

607
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,390
And there's a letter.

608
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,730
Well, go on then, go on.

609
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,270
''Dear Albert Narracott, Captain Nicholls, who died...

610
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,740
''Captain Nicholls, who died in action today, left you this. ''Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins.''

611
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,410
You weren't to know it was bad news.

612
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,610
He was riding Joey when he died.

613
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,280
You don't know that he was riding him. ''ln action,'' it says.

614
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,570
Gentlemen!

615
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,880
We move forward to the front line tonight.

616
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,550
Full marching orders.

617
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,020
Get moving!

618
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,350
Schroeder!

619
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,360
No, not you. You. Come.

620
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,930
l'm keeping you here. You're best with the horses, and we need to move the camp quickly

621
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,490
if the enemy continues to push through from the west.

622
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,830
They're pushing through? l'm told.

623
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,910
We will move later, when we find where the horses are needed most.

624
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:52,780
Yes, sir. Perhaps l can keep my brother here with me. He's also very good with horses.

625
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,610
No. Not necessary. Get moving, we leave tonight.

626
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,720
lt's all right, Gunther.

627
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,530
You are not going.

628
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,000
l'll tell them you're only 1 4. That you're a boy.

629
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,770
Father signed me in. He knew my age. And so do they.

630
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,340
Mother obviously never told you how to fold a shirt.

631
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,240
Of course she did. l just wasn't listening.

632
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,110
But you need to listen now. l promised her.

633
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:35,690
l made her a solemn promise that you would be safe with me.

634
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,690
With me, Michael.

635
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:47,070
They'll never make a head count. There are too many of us. You can stay here.

636
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,430
Slip underneath the bed, until they move out.

637
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,970
Then what?

638
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,770
Gunther, it will be fine.

639
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,570
And when all the machines break down and they call up the horses,

640
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,650
l'll see you at the front.

641
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,520
We'll be together again.

642
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,050
Gunther.

643
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,800
l'm giving this to you. For luck.

644
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,080
To keep you safe.

645
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,760
Get back in line!

646
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,130
l'm hungry. Did you bring food?

647
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,790
l'm sorry.

648
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:44,640
Will Father be ashamed? He will pretend to be.

649
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,340
Maybe at first he will be.

650
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,980
But in the end, he will be glad.

651
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,810
And us?

652
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,680
What about us?

653
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,960
l was ready to go.

654
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,830
l was proud to go.

655
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,400
l wanted to go.

656
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,710
The food in ltaly is good.

657
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,050
Yes.

658
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,160
And what about the women?

659
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,730
Not as good as the food.

660
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,390
Because 

661
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,930
they've eaten too much of the food?

662
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:48,730
You are too young for war and you're too young for women!

663
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,670
l don't feel so young.

664
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,210
Not anymore. Michael.

665
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,740
What? Go to sleep.

666
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,950
We have a big night of riding ahead.

667
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,020
Good night, Michael.

668
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,760
Nightnight, Gunther.

669
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,350
Schroeder. Yes, sir.

670
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,160
A mistake?

671
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,300
A promise.

672
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,340
lt's closer today.

673
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:14,280
The wind plays tricks with the noise. lt's moving away from us.

674
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,540
l can hear it, grandpere.

675
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,540
And there is no wind.

676
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,080
You shouldn't lie to me.

677
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,480
Here. There is no wind here.

678
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:28,880
But over there, the wind is so strong it will lift you off the ground.

679
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,220
You lie about everything!

680
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:37,670
You say you aren't worried, but it's clear you are.

681
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,100
l know the war is approaching,

682
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:43,640
but you say, ''Oh, it's just a trick of the wind.''

683
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,410
Did l say that?

684
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,380
You started lying when Mama and Papa went away.

685
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,510
They're dead.

686
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,640
But you won't say so.

687
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,180
Do you think l'll die if you tell me the truth?

688
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,120
The truth is

689
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:04,060
you should speak to your elders with respect.

690
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,440
lf you tell me the truth about the war,

691
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,000
l will tell you the truth about the big horses

692
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,610
l've been keeping in the windmill.

693
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,210
Now who is the one telling lies?

694
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,080
ln the windmill?

695
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:33,420
Yes. They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote.

696
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:37,020
This is Francois and this is Claude.

697
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,360
l named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer.

698
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,430
They must belong to someone.

699
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,540
Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy tale.

700
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:48,570
Yes, l know, grandpere. They are not unicorns.

701
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,170
So l will be fair and wait one day,

702
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:52,710


703
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,310
and if no one comes to get them by nighttime,

704
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,180
then they belong to me.

705
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,510
Emilie, look at me.

706
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,390
You cannot ride.

707
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,930
Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall.

708
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:11,520
Yes. That's right. So, it is settled?

709
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:14,730
Good girl.

710
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:21,200
lt will only be settled when l decide which one to ride first.

711
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,010
Over my dead body!

712
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,200
At least l won't have long to wait!

713
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,090
l was in love with a boy called Francois, who had your lovely eyes.

714
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:55,570
Unfortunately, he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth.

715
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,640
She fell for a boy called Claude, who broke my heart

716
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,950
and who l intend to marry one day.

717
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,320
Eyes on me.

718
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,720
No talking.

719
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,790
Today, we learn to jump.

720
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,700
Did you know the French cleared the 1 .85 meter at the Paris Olympics

721
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,220
to win the gold medal? Today, we will beat that record.

722
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,740
This is your jump.

723
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:29,270
When l call you, be very brave and leap over it!

724
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,140
Leap over it!

725
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:34,400
Watch me.

726
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:40,750
And now it's your...

727
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:24,800
He doesn't think we can do it. But we will show him, won't we?

728
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,740
No need to be afraid.

729
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,150
You are very tall.

730
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,680
You'll kill yourself.

731
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,880
Only if you get in my way to make me fall.

732
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,560
Oh, please. Come off the...

733
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,500
Find somewhere to hide them.

734
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,510
And do it quickly.

735
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:53,220
My name is Bonnard. This is my land. Why are you here?

736
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:57,880
Food. For the soldiers at the front. Everyone must give their share.

737
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,510
They are taking everything.

738
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,850
Where are the horses?

739
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,790
What horses?

740
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,670
What is it? Leave it if you don't know what it's for.

741
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,740
A pot is a pot. We'll find some use for it.

742
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:49,730
Sir.

743
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,480
Where's the livestock? l make jam. We have no animals.

744
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,810
But there's fresh hay in your barn.

745
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:00,610
We use it to replace the mattress stuffings.

746
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,420
Her grandfather? Yes.

747
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,960
Where are her parents? They're dead.

748
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,630
They died.

749
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,030
What is that?

750
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,770
The wind. lt plays tricks in the attic.

751
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,300
There is no wind.

752
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,770
An old house creaks.

753
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,310
Go, close the shutters.

754
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,320
She's sickly, no?

755
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:42,320
lf you or any of your friends harm her,

756
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,860
as old as l am, l will kill you.

757
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,000
You know,

758
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,870
 l was going to give you back your pot.

759
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,010
But now l'm going to keep it.

760
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,950
For soup.

761
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,680
We will be back.

762
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,880
ln the new season.

763
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,970
Tell me what happened to them.

764
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,780
To my mother and father.

765
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,060
You said you would tell me how they died

766
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,050
on my birthday.

767
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:52,920
And tomorrow's my birthday.

768
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,460
They died fighting.

769
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,930
Didn't they?

770
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,700
But when the soldiers come,

771
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,070
you do nothing.

772
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:09,740
You are a coward, aren't you? Yes.

773
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:13,080
lt was your parents who were brave.

774
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,410
l make jams.

775
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,020
And you've never done a brave thing in your life?

776
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:20,820


777
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:29,690
Maybe there are different ways to be brave.

778
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,030
Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons?

779
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,570
And this could be the difference in the war,our messages getting through.

780
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,480


781
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,710
l don't want to hear about the birds.

782
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,650
They are released at the front 

783
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:54,860
and told to go home.

784
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,450
This is all they know.

785
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,660
But to get there, 

786
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,660
they must fly over a war.

787
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,000
Can you imagine such a thing?

788
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:11,570
Here you are flying over

789
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:16,940
so much pain and terror, and you know you can never look down.

790
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:21,080
You have to look forward, or you'll never get home.

791
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:26,820
l ask you, what could be braver than that?

792
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,460
What is that? A present.

793
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,990
l hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that l then have to wear, like last year.

794
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:11,600


795
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,930
lt was disgusting? Yes.

796
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,970
l looked like an ugly nun.

797
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,580
Give me your hand.

798
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,080
Grandpere, we have no money!

799
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,750
When the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages.

800
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,550
Anything you say, my sweet one. Anything you say.

801
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,090
You are, of course, the boss.

802
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,490
lt's just an old thing l found.

803
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,900
Don't worry yourself. Leave it. l'll put it back.

804
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,120
lt was your mother's.

805
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:15,730
l hid it so as not to encourage you.

806
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:21,070
Emilie, l want you to ride very slowly. Very carefully.

807
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,610
And promise me you won't go far. Of course.

808
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:28,050
To the top of the hill and straight back again. l promise.

809
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,540
My hero!

810
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,220
Slowly. Slowly.

811
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,830
Emilie!

812
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:56,040
Emilie!

813
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:34,080
Let go of me! No! She is my granddaughter!

814
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:37,040
Francois! Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please!

815
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,680
Don't hurt her. No!

816
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,950
You don't need them. There are so many others!

817
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,720
Please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one.

818
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,760
You are breaking my granddaughter's heart.

819
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:59,090
The war has taken everything from everyone.

820
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,100
What will happen to them? They will pull artillery until they die.

821
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,370
Or until the war is over.

822
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:10,370
lt will never be over!

823
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,310
You have your answer then.

824
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,020
Heiglemann.

825
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,290
These are yours. Yes, sir.

826
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,030
They look strong. Should last a month or two.

827
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,030
You're beautiful.

828
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,710
lt's a pity they found you.

829
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,850
Such a pity.

830
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:35,720
Pull together, men! Pull together!

831
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:40,400
Together, men! Together! Put your backs into it!

832
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,410
Steady pace! Steady pace!

833
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,870
Watch out, number three's slacking! Move it, move it!

834
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,950
Halt! Halt!

835
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,210
 Break!

836
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,950
Break! Stop! Stop!

837
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,970
Heiglemann! Bring out another one!

838
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:25,050
Heiglemann, bring up another horse!

839
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,450
That one!

840
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:35,350
No, no! The big black one!

841
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,010
He's a good horse, sir.

842
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:59,550
But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.

843
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,510
Prince is already losing condition. His leg, sir.

844
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,880
You have given them names? Yes, sir.

845
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:07,960
You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose.

846
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:10,030
But his leg is not good enough, sir.

847
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:13,290
Private, you will do as you are told.

848
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:14,520
Hook him up!

849
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,440
Can't you see, sir? This one is stronger.

850
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:29,210
Hook him up!

851
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,140
No slacking!

852
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:10,010
Keep it taut! Use your whip!

853
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:56,990
No slacking! To the top!

854
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:05,470
Halt!

855
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,610
Take the horses away.

856
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,080
Shell!

857
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,360
And load!

858
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:36,100
Back!

859
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,300
Case!

860
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:44,650
Position!

861
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,050
And

862
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,280
fire!

863
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,560


864
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,160
Valuables in the bucket, lads! lf you live, you'll get them back!

865
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:40,530
lf you live, you get them back. Good luck!

866
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,640
Valuables in the bucket!

867
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:58,450
The blood of Christ keep thee in eternal life.

868
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,120


869
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,460
Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe it's a drill, like last time.

870
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,400
Love letter?

871
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,540
Well, that's my business.

872
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:21,670
l hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again.

873
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,410
Are you going to write a letter to your horse?

874
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:30,820
After you find your horse, l've lost my needle in a haystack and l could use some help.

875
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,080
Anything valuable!

876
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:36,750
Anyone who comes back gets to share it out!

877
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:39,090
Stay here.

878
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,500
Remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car?

879
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,830
l remember you somersaulting through the air.

880
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,110
Who was that girl you were with?

881
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,170
There was a girl?

882
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:54,100
There was. Don't you remember?

883
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,310
lt was just some girl, l suppose. l don't recall which one.

884
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:01,640
l do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch.

885
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:03,250
You see?

886
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:07,180
Always entertaining, Narracott. l'll give you that.

887
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:11,130
You did that? You fell on your bum?

888
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,730
lnto position! Everyone ready!

889
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:28,340
There she goes! lnto position! Let's go!

890
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:30,810
Go! Choke on it! Yes, Sarge!

891
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:34,280
Be brave, boys! Be ready! Be ready!

892
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,820
Let's go, men, get ready to go!

893
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:40,620
Hold your nerve, boys!

894
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,750
Remember, it's not too far to go, there's a way through!

895
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:46,830
Run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open,

896
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,230
and God and the King will keep an eye on you.

897
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:52,900
Company will fix bayonets! Fix bayonets!

898
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,700
You know what it reminds me of out there?

899
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,240
What? That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it.

900
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,710
Best day of my life, that was, and you were there.

901
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:05,650
And this here is the worst day of my life about to begin,

902
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:09,450
and you're here cheering me on. Us two, always!

903
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:11,250
And him.

904
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:14,260
Once you're in no man's land, go to the flank,

905
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,330
stay on the flank. Yes, sir. Come on, boys, to the ladders! Stick close to the gentry, yeah?

906
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,560
That's our ticket. We have the pluck, but they have the luck.

907
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,460
Come on, boys, keep going. Keep going.

908
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,660
Andrew.

909
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,670
You, too, Narracott.

910
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,330
And you, too.

911
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,960
Come on. On your ladders, boys! On your ladders.

912
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:51,230
ln you go! ln you go! That's it!

913
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,960
Listen to your Sergeant!

914
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,830
lf anybody turns back,

915
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,860
if any one of our boys comes running towards you,

916
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:05,840
you take this rifle and you shoot them dead!

917
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,410
Do you understand? Yes, sir!

918
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,480
Do you understand me? Do you understand what l'm telling you, son?

919
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,810
You take this rifle and you shoot them dead.

920
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:16,610
You understand?

921
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,990
Up there, son. Up your ladder! Up your ladder to your work!

922
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:25,590
lt's good. Andrew, it's good.

923
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,330
Andrew!

924
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,700
Nobody's retreating today.

925
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:34,000
Andrew! Andrew, nobody is retreating today!

926
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,940
Ready to go over the top!

927
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,420
Just leave me! Leave me!

928
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:24,610
You'll be all right here. You'll be safe. Someone will come for you.

929
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:26,980
Albert.

930
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:30,110
Albert, listen. lt's all right.

931
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,950
lt's all right. We're Devon boys. Yeah?

932
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,720
Yeah.

933
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,800
Get down!

934
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:32,960
No!

935
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,900
Albie.

936
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,710
We made it.

937
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,060
We made it.

938
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:11,210
Andrew! This way out!

939
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:14,740
Gas, gas, gas!

940
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,240
Albie.

941
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,840
There's no stopping here. Keep them moving!

942
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:57,650
But, there's something wrong. This one needs to rest.

943
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:01,720
There's no rest for them. Move them along! Move them along!

944
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:26,150
please. Stay on your feet. No, please!

945
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,680
No

946
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,740
No. Please.

947
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:34,150
Please. Stay on your feet.

948
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,790
Come on, come on. Please.

949
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:39,820
No, please. Stay on your feet. Come on.

950
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,820
They're coming. Leave it, Private! Leave it!

951
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,350
Come with me.

952
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:42,290
Go to hell!

953
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:46,220
Run!

954
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,430
Run! 

955
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,060
Run!

956
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,830
Run!

957
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:53,360
Run!

958
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,770
Stand to, stand to.

959
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:12,770
There's something moving.

960
01:51:13,070 --> 01:51:15,040
What the hell is it?

961
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,770
lt looks like a cow.

962
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:23,310
What the hell would a cow be doing up there?

963
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:30,180
That definitely isn't a cow.

964
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:32,050
Well, what is it?

965
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:35,120
lt can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be out there.

966
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:38,320
lt isn't a horse. lt isn't a horse!

967
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,130
Yes, it's a horse.

968
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,000
lt's a horse. Yeah, it's a horse.

969
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:48,070
Well, bugger me.

970
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:50,930
lt's a horse!

971
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:57,070
Lads, we should call him.

972
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,880
How do you call a horse?

973
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,860
He's caught on the wire.

974
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,130
Oh, sod it.

975
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,010
What do you think you're doing?

976
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:02,410
Get back, do you hear me?

977
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:05,210
Corporal, that's an order. Get back!

978
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,870
Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.

979
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,350
What's he doing?

980
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:13,080
lt's a trap.

981
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,220
No, l don't think so. l think he's trying to help.

982
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:18,220
Scare him back into his hole.

983
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:28,130
lt's a white flag, isn't it?

984
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:30,270
You see the white flag?

985
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:33,910
l'm just after tending to this here horse is all!

986
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,320
Get back, you stupid git!

987
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:44,650
''The Lord is my shepherd. l shall not want.

988
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,910
''He leadeth me into green pastures.

989
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:53,460
''He leadeth me down beside still waters.''

990
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:10,210
Poor beastie.

991
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,010
Poor babbie.

992
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,610
lt's all right.

993
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:17,350
lt's all right, don't buck and wriggle so.

994
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,620
You're only shredding yourself.

995
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,220
You'll blind yourself.

996
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,960
Bugger me worthless. l didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut the...

997
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:37,570
l thought perhaps you might need these.

998
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:39,500
For the barbed wire.

999
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,240
Yeah.

1000
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,970
Yeah, l...

1001
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,570
Thanks.

1002
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:47,510
Cheers.

1003
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:49,510
Cheers.

1004
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:51,180
Thanks.

1005
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,330
That's a very long strand.

1006
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:05,540
And when you cut it, it's going to release

1007
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,300
this, and this, and this.

1008
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:14,800
And they'll coil back rather violently, which, l'm afraid, will only wound the poor fellow further.

1009
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,210
You speak good English.

1010
01:55:19,650 --> 01:55:21,280
l speak English well.

1011
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,680
May l?

1012
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:40,200
What if we cut his head free first, so he won't try to stand up and blind himself?

1013
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,370
And then... Pity you didn't bring a second pair.

1014
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,440
Then l could cut the wire here.

1015
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:47,210
We need more wire cutters!

1016
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,650
His blind spot.

1017
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:02,720
The cutters won't frighten him.

1018
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,790
lf you could cut here, holding this wire,

1019
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:10,270
l could... Say no more. l'm right behind you.

1020
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:13,630
And you understand what's happening, do you not, O Best Beloved?

1021
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,400
And you must lay so very nice and still.

1022
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:18,060
There's a lad.

1023
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,540
A remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you.

1024
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:24,070
There's a lad.

1025
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:26,280
There's a remarkable lad.

1026
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,410
So, how's things in yonder trench?

1027
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:34,820
Delightful.

1028
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:39,290
We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.

1029
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:44,200
lf you ever need any more rats, we can always send ours over 'cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking.

1030
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:48,100
Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.

1031
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:50,360
Our girls aren't afraid of rats.

1032
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,370
Big strapping German girls, eh?

1033
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,240
Kind what give robust massages?

1034
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,520
Every Thursday.

1035
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:02,380
And they bring rum cake on your birthday.

1036
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:17,630


1037
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:23,900
Look at that horse!

1038
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:27,610
Look at the muscles he's got. Them long legs.

1039
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:31,610
They're made for running, horses. Running away from danger.

1040
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,810
Running away is all they have.

1041
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:37,280
And yet we taught 'em opposite.

1042
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,350
Running into the fray.

1043
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:42,550
A war horse. Yeah.

1044
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:45,690
War horse.

1045
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,830
There he is.

1046
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:50,670
What a strange beast you've become.

1047
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:54,170
And now?

1048
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,300
l'll take him back with me, yeah?

1049
01:57:56,810 --> 01:58:00,830
Since l supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. This is fair, no?

1050
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:03,440
ln a pig's eye. He's English, plain to see.

1051
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:06,380
You mean because he's so filthy? Because he's so smart!

1052
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,610
And you're none too clean yourself.

1053
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:14,620
We could box. And the winner gets the horse.

1054
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:18,590
No, thanks, pet.

1055
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:21,200
 Must be careful not to start a war.

1056
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:25,400
Do you have a coin of any sort?

1057
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,270
Coin toss? Yeah.

1058
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:34,680
All right, Fritz, you're on. My name is not Fritz.

1059
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,480
lt is Peter.

1060
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,480
Peter. l'm Colin.

1061
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,810
You call it, Colin. Heads.

1062
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,820
That's the face of my Kaiser, and he does not look pleased with me.

1063
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,430
The horse is yours.

1064
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:57,890
Gone quiet, hasn't it?

1065
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:59,760
Yes.

1066
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,640
But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.

1067
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:06,830
l'm a terrible shot, Pete. Don't believe l'll ever hit a target.

1068
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,500
Thanks.

1069
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:12,910
Cheerio, mate.

1070
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,440
You'll take good care of him, yes? l will.

1071
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:17,250
Our strange beast.

1072
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:19,850
And you take care of your own strange self.

1073
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:21,510
Colin!

1074
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:27,560
A pair of German cutters. ln memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.

1075
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:30,930
Thanks. l'll use them back in the garden in South Shields.

1076
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:33,600
You keep your head down now, Pete, my lad.

1077
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:38,730
Remarkable. A remarkable horse!

1078
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,310
We're full up. Move on.

1079
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:21,710
We're full up. Move on.

1080
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:27,920
The gas got him. We had to wait till morning.

1081
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:35,330
This can't be all of us. This is all.

1082
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:37,360
All walking wounded

1083
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:40,660
away to the dressing station!

1084
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:44,070
Away to the dressing station!

1085
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,620
Just hold still.

1086
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,490
You're doing so well.

1087
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,970
What's this doing here? We need a vet, sir.

1088
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:26,710
There are no vets. There are scarcely any horses left.

1089
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:29,680
He's cut all over, but this leg here has got the worst of it.

1090
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:38,690
lt's probably tetanus. lt's no good. 

1091
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:39,790
Please, sir!

1092
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:42,390
l've all these men to take care of, Corporal. You can see that, can't you?

1093
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,800
Please, sir, this horse can pull through anything!

1094
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:57,610
What is it?

1095
02:01:58,450 --> 02:02:02,010
lt's a horse they found wandering about in no man's land. Down you go.

1096
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:06,060
What kind of a horse? Bloody miraculous kind of a horse be my guess.

1097
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,620
Nothing makes it out of no man's land.

1098
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:15,560
Miraculous horse.

1099
02:02:17,670 --> 02:02:20,100
He was alive, you see, sir, where nothing survives.

1100
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:24,740
So to me and my mates, to the men, sir, he's... Well, we have high hopes for him.

1101
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:26,640
You should shoot him now.

1102
02:02:27,610 --> 02:02:30,580
Oh, but l can't. lt'd be a mercy, lad.

1103
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:32,710
That leg's not going to mend.

1104
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,450
Sergeant.

1105
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:37,850
Put him out of his misery.

1106
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,730
He's not going to shoot it here, is he?

1107
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,920
What's going on here? They're going to shoot the horse.

1108
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:51,070
Ladies, if you please.

1109
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,660
Come, nurses.

1110
02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:01,010
All right, back off! Back off!

1111
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,680
Go on, do it again.

1112
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:15,880
Go on.

1113
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:24,090
Joey?

1114
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,310
Hello, Joey.

1115
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:46,780
 Where you been then, eh?

1116
02:04:47,950 --> 02:04:49,780
Where in the world you been?

1117
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:51,710
Do you know this man?

1118
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,780
What's your name? Narracott.

1119
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,260
Private Albert Narracott, sir.

1120
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,650
lt's just a random horse, Narracott, and too badly injured.

1121
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,730
ls this man in your care? Yes, sir.

1122
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:06,860
He's not random at all, sir! He's my horse. l raised him, in Devon.

1123
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,260
Sir, look at his legs.

1124
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:12,130
He's got four white socks, he's brown all over,

1125
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:14,770
and he has a white mark here, like so.

1126
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,740
Take him back. Come on, son.

1127
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,220
Wait! You can't see 'cause of the mud!

1128
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,250
Four white socks.

1129
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,370
All right, break it up! Clear off, the lot of ya!

1130
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,180
You see, sir? 

1131
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,380
He's not random at all.

1132
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:06,990
We'll attend to your horse.

1133
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,450
Patch him up best we can.

1134
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:12,130
Treat him like the soldier he is.

1135
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:14,720
Thank you, sir.

1136
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:42,290
Gentlemen!

1137
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,420
Gentlemen!

1138
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:47,750
lt falls on me to give you some important news.

1139
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:51,490
At 1 1 :00 today, in two minutes' time,

1140
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:54,270
the war will come to an end.

1141
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:58,500
The King and Queen thank you for your service.

1142
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:00,970
We have been victorious,

1143
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:04,770
even if it's a higher price than many of us might have imagined.

1144
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:06,780
When the bells ring out,

1145
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:10,110
and they will in a moment, for the first time in four years,

1146
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:13,380
let us remember our brothers fallen in the field,

1147
02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:15,950
and thank God for the end of this struggle,

1148
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:18,320
and victory.

1149
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:34,440
l don't understand, sir.

1150
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:40,580
Officers' horses only. All other horses are to be auctioned immediately.

1151
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:45,280
That is a complete and bloody outrage. lt's the lad's horse, sir! From Devon.

1152
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:50,050
He raised him up from a pup, he did. Trained him right up to the day when the army came to town!

1153
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,890
These aren't my orders, Sergeant.

1154
02:08:54,330 --> 02:08:56,490
You'll have to take him to market tomorrow.

1155
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,960
That's all.

1156
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:25,800
We've all clubbed together.

1157
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:27,930
lt's everything we have.

1158
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:32,460
There's 29 pounds there. Buy him back.

1159
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:38,840
Does the Major know?

1160
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:41,770
The Major put in 1 0. Mum's the word where the Major's concerned.

1161
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:43,970
Your friend, on the crutches over there,

1162
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:47,120
even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse,

1163
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,610
so that he could go back with the others.

1164
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:54,650
Come on, Narracott, get a move on. We don't want to miss the show.

1165
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:06,930
Seven pounds! Seven pounds there!

1166
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,230
Seven pounds! 

1167
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:10,970
Eight pounds here! Eight pounds!

1168
02:10:11,210 --> 02:10:14,230
Ten pounds here! Any advance? Sold!

1169
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:19,680
All right. No one's going to bid more than 1 5 for a thoroughbred. They want workhorses.

1170
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:24,190
Next one!

1171
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:27,650
We start at four pounds!

1172
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,990
Four pounds!

1173
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,720
Five pounds! Five pounds here!

1174
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,960
Any advance? Seven pounds!

1175
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:37,630
Eight pounds! Nine pounds!

1176
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,590
Ten pounds!

1177
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:41,130
Eleven pounds!

1178
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:47,740
lt's the butcher from Cambrai. He's been bidding for the best all morning. Eleven pounds.

1179
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:50,650
Let me handle this, Private. Fifteen!

1180
02:10:50,850 --> 02:10:52,610
And let that be an end to it!

1181
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,040
Fifteen pounds!

1182
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,810
Sixteen pounds.

1183
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:58,540
Seventeen!

1184
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:03,090
Twenty of your English pounds. And let that be the end of it, my friend.

1185
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:04,780
Twenty pounds!

1186
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:07,100
Twentyfive pounds!

1187
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:09,560
Twentysix.

1188
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:11,030
Twentysix pounds!

1189
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:13,230
Twentyseven! Twentyeight!

1190
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,830
Twentyeight pounds.

1191
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:16,060
Twentynine!

1192
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:17,330
And thirty!

1193
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:19,680
Any advance on thirty pounds?

1194
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:22,030
One hundred pounds!

1195
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:29,650
And, sir, if you bid against me,

1196
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:34,190
l will sell the coat on my back and bid to 1 1 0.

1197
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:37,650
And if you bid against me again, l will sell my farm,

1198
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:39,920
and bid to a thousand!

1199
02:11:43,030 --> 02:11:45,060
One hundred pounds!

1200
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:48,190
Going, going,

1201
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:49,860
gone!

1202
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:00,270
Sir,

1203
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:04,020
l'll give you all your money, everything you paid,when we get back to England. 

1204
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:06,680
l'll give you twice what... You don't know anything about him.

1205
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:08,820
But you're wrong, sir. l know everything.

1206
02:12:08,990 --> 02:12:13,330
Yes, you found him. l heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies.

1207
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:15,630
No, l found him. He raised him.

1208
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:21,030
When l heard about the miracle horse, l traveled three days

1209
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,170
because l knew whose horse he was.

1210
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:26,910
My granddaughter's.

1211
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:31,040
She saved his life. He was everything to her.

1212
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:32,910
Where is your granddaughter?

1213
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,850
The war has taken everything from everyone.

1214
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:38,320
He is all that l have left of her.

1215
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,940
Don't be worried, boy, when l go.

1216
02:13:04,180 --> 02:13:06,270
l won't worry over you none.

1217
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,780
Hey, l found you, didn't l?

1218
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:11,880
And you found me.

1219
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:17,290
And we'll both...

1220
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:20,360
We'll both know that we made it through.

1221
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,690
Now come on.

1222
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:26,430
We're the lucky ones. Always have been.

1223
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:28,890
Lucky since the day l met you.

1224
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:33,140
God be with you, sir.

1225
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:38,050
Do you know what this is?

1226
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:44,110
That's my father's.

1227
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:46,850
That's his regimental pennant.

1228
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,790
How did you come by this, sir?

1229
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:59,860
You may have this.

1230
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:11,070
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.

1231
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,280
And this.

1232
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,790
Sir, l... No, no, no.

1233
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,860
Not necessary. He belongs to you.

1234
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:33,760
That is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted.

1235
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,970
And she was the boss.

1236
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:48,350
What was her name?

1237
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:50,520
Emilie.

1238
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:56,050
Her name is Emilie.

1239
02:17:58,710 --> 02:18:02,240
