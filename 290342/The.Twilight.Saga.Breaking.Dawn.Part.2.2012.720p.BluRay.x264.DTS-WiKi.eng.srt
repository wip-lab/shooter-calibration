1
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,810


2
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
So beautiful.

3
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,020
We're the same temperature now.

4
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,760
Hey, Bella,

5
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,270
you're a lot stronger than I am right now.

6
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,490
It's your turn not to break me.

7
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
I love you.

8
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,540
I love you.

9
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,260
Renesmee.

10
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,440
She's incredible.

11
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,910
Where is she? I have to see her.

12
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,170
Wait. Wait.

13
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,580
You need to get your thirst under control.

14
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,890
Yeah, you'll need to hunt.

15
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,380
Close your eyes.

16
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,760
What do you hear?

17
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,800
Bella, don't!

18
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,750
Bella, stop!

19
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm sorry, I didn't realize there'd be people this far from the trails.

20
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,400
I have to get outta here.

21
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,940
Okay, I can help you.

22
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,250
Or not.

23
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,850
Well, I'm amazed.

24
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,190
You ran away from human blood mid-hunt.

25
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,590
Even mature vampires have problems with that.

26
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,940
You're still here.

27
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,510
So are you.

28
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,990
I didn't expect you to seem so

29
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,050
you.

30
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,620
Except for the creepy eyes.

31
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,870
I would keep my distance for now.

32
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,670
It's safer for the baby to see how you do with me first.

33
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,940
Since when do you care about Renesmee?

34
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,820
All right.

35
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,430
Take a whiff.

36
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,720
Well, I can see what everyone's been talking about.

37
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,130
Jake, you really do stink.

38
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,870
You GUYS

39
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,320
really look great together.

40
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,760
Want to come meet our daughter?

41
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,890
Welcome to the family.

42
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,070
You look amazing, Bella.

43
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,380
Someone's been waiting to meet you.

44
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,280
Rose.

45
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,610
Beautiful.

46
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,940
What was that?

47
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,900
She showed you the first memory she has of you.

48
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,310
Showed me? How?

49
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,690
How do I hear thoughts?

50
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,390
How does Alice see the future?

51
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,930
She's gifted.

52
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,640
I've only been out for two days?

53
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,870
Her growth rate is unprecedented.

54
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,130
All right. That's enough experimenting for one day.

55
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,530
Jacob.

56
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,070
She's doing great.

57
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,400
Yeah. Let's not push it though.

58
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,510
What's your problem?

59
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,070
Oh.

60
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,810
Do tell her, Jacob.

61
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,680
This should be good.

62
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
Hold on a second.

63
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,520
Bella.

64
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,970
Look,

65
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
it's a wolf thing.

66
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
What's a wolf thing?

67
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,910
Um...

68
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,190
You know we have no control over it.

69
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,160
We can't choose who it happens with.

70
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,600
And it doesn't mean what you think, Bella. I promise.

71
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,370
Take Renesmee out of the room.

72
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,530
Oh.

73
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,280
Edward, don't touch me right now. I don't want to hurt you.

74
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh.

75
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,470
You imprinted on my daughter?

76
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,770
It wasn't my choice!

77
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,710
She's a baby!

78
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
It's not like that.

79
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,380
You think Edward would let me live if it was?

80
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,450
I'm still debating it.

81
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,620
I've held her once!

82
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,120
One time, Jacob!

83
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,870
And already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her?

84
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,030
She's mine!

85
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,610
It's fine, Leah.

86
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,320
You're gonna stay away from her.

87
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,850
You know I can't do that.

88
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,000
Stop her, Edward.

89
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,970
He said it's fine.

90
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,900
She's amazing, right?

91
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,850
Do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago?

92
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,060
That's gone now, right?

93
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,760
Long gone.

94
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,250
Because itwas her.

95
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,070
From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.

96
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,190
Nessie?

97
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,200
You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?

98
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,450
Seth, are you okay?

99
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,030
Seth, I'm sorry.

100
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,070
He'll be all right.

101
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,710
Bella,

102
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,360
you know me better than anyone.

103
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,960
All I want is for Ness...

104
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,110
Renesmee to be safe. Happy.

105
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,950
Look,

106
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,650
nothing ever made sense before.

107
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,810
You. Me. Any of it.

108
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,080
And now I understand why.

109
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,230
This was the reason.

110
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,980
Finally.

111
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,430
My turn.

112
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,690
Where does she sleep?

113
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,990
In my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.

114
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,340
Happy birthday.

115
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,120
I stopped aging three days ago.

116
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,680
Well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.

117
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,510
I still hate surprises. That hasn't changed.

118
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,910
You'll love this one.

119
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,650
Welcome home!

120
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,160
We thought you guys might like a place of your own.

121
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,070
What do you think?

122
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,660
I think it's perfect.

123
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,140
Go inside.

124
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,400
Have fun.

125
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
This will be Renesmee's room.

126
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,950
Closet.

127
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,920
WOW.

128
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,790
Alice stocked it for you.

129
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,800
Clearly.

130
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,290
This is our room.

131
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,970
Vampires don't sleep.

132
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,350
It's not intended for sleep.

133
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,120
You really were holding back before.

134
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,140
I'm never gonna get enough of this.

135
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,510
We don't get tired.

136
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,780
We don't have to rest or catch our breath or eat.

137
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,490
I mean, I mean,

138
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,010
how are we gonna stop?

139
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,810
Rosalie and Emmettwere so bad, it took a solid decade

140
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,300
before we could stand to be within five miles of them.

141
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,340
I think we might be worse.

142
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,880
Definitely worse.

143
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,760
EMMETTl WOW.

144
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,200
Done already?

145
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,490
Where's Renesmee?

146
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,470
Blondie stole her.

147
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,650
Break a lot of stuff?

148
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,390
Emmett.

149
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,880
No.

150
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,780
Is that Charlie?

151
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,280
He's been calling twice a day.

152
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,520
He's in pretty rough shape.

153
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,770
Eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.

154
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,870
He needs to mourn, Bella.

155
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,620
Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.

156
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,270
I'm gonna miss this place.

157
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,530
We'll come back. We always do.

158
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,870
Wait.

159
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,950
Nobody said anything about leaving.

160
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,720
Once people believe Bella's dead, we can't risk anyone seeing her.

161
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,470
So you just disappear?

162
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,440
Jacob, we don't have another choice.

163
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,510
Hey.

164
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,380
You heard anything?

165
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,360
Charlie,

166
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,600
Bella is... Uh...

167
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,290
No, she's not.

168
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,320
No, no, no, I mean, she's fine. She's back home and

169
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,380
she's feeling better.

170
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,890
Why didn't you say so? That's great.

171
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,730
Wait.

172
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,310
There's something you need to see first.

173
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,220
I need to see Bella.

174
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,520
Look,

175
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,390
in order for Bella to get better, she had to

176
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,070
change.

177
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,930
What do you mean, "change"?

178
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,460
Here goes nothing.

179
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,990
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,790
You don't live in the world you think you do.

181
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,270
Jacob, put your clothes on.

182
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,810
Now, this may seem strange.

183
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,780
Really strange. But

184
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,560
stranger things happen every day.

185
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,700
Trust me.

186
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,820
Holy shit!

187
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Look, I solved a problem.

188
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,780
You were leaving.

189
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,140
What did you expect me to do?

190
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,250
You don't realize the danger you've put him in.

191
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,550
The Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.

192
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,960
No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me.

193
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,460
I only said you were different.

194
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,900
And that we have a niece who we adopted.

195
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,470
I mean, seriously, Jake, he's not just gonna let that go.

196
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,140
Did you consider the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

197
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,280
It'll be like sticking a white hot branding iron down her throat.

198
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,220
And that's assuming she can control her thirst.

199
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,360
Look, Charlie's been in hell.

200
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
And I know you'll be much happier with him in your life.

201
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,660
Jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this for anyone but yourself.

202
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,040
Sorry you feel that way

203
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,410
because he'll be here in 1 0 minutes.

204
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,450
What?

205
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,640
These will irritate your eyes at first.

206
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,860
The main thing is not to move too fast.

207
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,660
Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.

208
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,010
Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.

209
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,780
And blink at least three times a minute.

210
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,360
Good.

211
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,340
For a cartoon character.

212
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,740
Hold your breath. it will help with the thirst.

213
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,480
Just don't forget to move your shoulders so it looks like you're breathing.

214
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,420
And don't sit so straight.

215
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,290
Humans don't do that.

216
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,180
Okay. I got it.

217
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,910
Move around, blink, slouch.

218
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,250
Good luck.

219
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,080
Hello, Charlie.

220
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,310
Where's Bella?

221
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,490
Bella.

222
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,010
Hi, Dad.

223
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,260
Are you okay?

224
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,230
Never better.

225
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,940
Healthy as a horse.

226
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,780
You don't turn into an animal, too, do you?

227
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,630
She wishes she was that awesome.

228
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,070
Let's give them some privacy.

229
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,110
Uh, Jake said that this...

230
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,960
This was necessary.

231
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,650
What does that mean?

232
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,430
I really think it would be better...

233
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,100
I wanna knowwhat happened to you.

234
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,500
I can't tell you.

235
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,540
I think I deserve an explanation.

236
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,640
You do.

237
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,720
But if you really need one, I can't stay here.

238
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,530
Oh, come on! No!

239
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,160
No more going away!

240
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,920
Dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason,

241
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,960
I'm all right.

242
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,240
I'm more than all right.

243
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,500
Can you live with that?

244
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,910
Can I live With that?

245
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,750
Well, I don't know, Bella.

246
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,500
I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life

247
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,130
turn into a very large dog.

248
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,960
My daughter looks like my daughter.

249
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,110
But doesn't.

250
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,550
Can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that you need to know?

251
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,690
And I don't need to know this?

252
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,070
No.

253
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,240
Really, you don't.

254
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,320
Well...

255
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,460
Not gonna lose you again.

256
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,560
I can't.

257
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,900
Then you won't.

258
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,640
I promise.

259
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,810
I missed you, Bells.

260
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,080
So much.

261
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,720
I missed you, Dad.

262
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,740
Charlie.

263
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,510
This is Renesmee.

264
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,690
Your niece?

265
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,970
Our daughter.

266
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,580
Right.

267
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,110
The adoption.

268
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,930
Renee-semee?

269
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,210
She's got your eyes, Bella.

270
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,990
Need to know, I guess.

271
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,970
Well clone, Bella.

272
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,730
Never seen a newborn show that kind of restraint.

273
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,270
I'm not sure she is a newborn.

274
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,670
She's so tame.

275
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,780
Emmett, don't antagonize her. She's the strongest one in the house.

276
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,250
Please.

277
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,200
Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.

278
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,210
All right. On 3. 1бн 1...

279
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,480
2бн 2...

280
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,060
3!

281
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,460
Did you see that?

282
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,180
Thank you.

283
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,990
My time as a human was over.

284
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,870
But I never felt more alive.

285
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,580
I was born to be a vampire. I was born to be a vampire.

286
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,080
Everything was falling into place.

287
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,460
Even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status.

288
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,400
Though they'd want proof eventually.

289
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,970


290
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,500
It seemed we had only one enemy left.

291
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,470
Time.

292
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,920
Renesmee was growing too fast.

293
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,890
We all worried about how long we would have with her.

294
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,800
It just made every moment more precious.

295
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,870
Look, a snowflake.

296
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,710
It's beautiful.

297
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,890
Why don't you go get another one?

298
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,030
Edward thinks that we'll find answers in Brazil.

299
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,730
There are tribes there that might know something.

300
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,370
RENESMEEl Who was that?

301
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,980
I think that's our cousin from Denali.

302
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,690
Irina!

303
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,380
Tanya convinced lrina to come reconcile with us.

304
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,020
It looks like she changed her mind.

305
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,490
Seeing Jacob must have been too much for her.

306
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,390
Wish I could have just spoken to her.

307
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,860
She's family. She'll come around.

308
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,600
What a pleasant surprise.

309
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,280
What do you want?

310
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,950
Hmm?

311
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,860
I have to report a crime.

312
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,770
The Cullens...

313
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,940
They've done something terrible.

314
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,260
Allow me, my dear.

315
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,960
Oh, my-

316
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,970
What is it, Alice?

317
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
The Volturi.

318
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,120
They're coming for us.

319
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,190
Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard.

320
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,260
And lrina.

321
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,660
Honey, come here.

322
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,570
Why?

323
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,070
What did lrina see in the woods?

324
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,370
We were just walking.

325
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,240
Ness was catching snowflakes.

326
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,180
Of course.

327
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,030
Irina thinks Renesmee's an lmmortal Child.

328
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,140
The lmmortal Children were very beautiful.

329
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,880
So enchanting.

330
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,750
To be near them was to love them.

331
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,060
But their development was frozen at the age they were turned.

332
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,550
They couldn't be taught or restrained.

333
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,630
A single tantrum could destroy an entire village.

334
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,750
Humans heard about the devastation.

335
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,760
Stories spread.

336
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,360
The Volturi were forced to intervene.

337
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,820
Since the Children couldn't protect our secret,

338
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,150
they had to be destroyed.

339
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,530
No!

340
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,940
No!

341
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,380
No!

342
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,280
Their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them.

343
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,430
Long-established covens were torn apart.

344
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,730
Countless humans slaughtered.

345
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,180
Traditions, friends,

346
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,980
even families. Lost.

347
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,720
No, no!

348
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,190
- Mother! - No!

349
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,790
Mother!

350
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,740
So the Denalis' mother made an lmmortal Child?

351
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,610
Yes.

352
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,480
And she paid the price.

353
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,730
Well, Renesmee's nothing like those children.

354
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,940
She was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.

355
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,450
So can't you just explain that to the Volturi?

356
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,070
Aro has enough proof in lrina's thoughts.

357
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,060
So we fight.

358
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,460
Their offensive weapons are too powerful.

359
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,500
No one can stand against Jane.

360
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,810
Alec's even worse.

361
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,580
Well, then we convince them.

362
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,170
They're coming to kill us, not to talk.

363
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,340
No, you're right.

364
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,780
They won't listen to us.

365
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,700
But maybe others can convince them.

366
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,770
Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.

367
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,100
I won't ask them to fight.

368
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
Not fight. Witness.

369
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,150
If enough people knew the truth,

370
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,210
maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.

371
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,890
We can ask this of our friends.

372
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,890
At least we get to go to London again. At least we get to go to London again.

373
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,380
We haven't been there in a long time.

374
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,990
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

375
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,080
Alice asked me to give you that.

376
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,100
She and Jasper crossed our lands to the ocean last night.

377
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,080
Carlisle?

378
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,720
They've left us.

379
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,490
Why?

380
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,170
She didn't say.

381
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,640
Can I see that?

382
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,530
Gather as many witnesses as you can before the snow sticks to the ground.

383
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,800
That's when they'll come.

384
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,180


385
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,940
Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained.

386
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,980
Why would she and Jasper leave at the moment we needed them most?

387
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,880
What did they know?

388
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,330
Our search for witnesses began with a trip north to our closest relatives.

389
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,970
Edward, is everything all right?

390
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,910
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

391
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,920
Is it lrina?

392
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,460
Have you heard from her?

393
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,930
Not directly.

394
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,270
Why is your bride waiting in the car?

395
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,840
And why have you brought a wolf with you?

396
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,270
I can smell him from here.

397
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,310
My family is in danger. I need your help.

398
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,080
What's happened?

399
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,950
It's hard to explain

400
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,260
but I need you to be open-minded. Can you do that?

401
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,420
Of course.

402
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,060
Okay.

403
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,140
Time to meet some new people.

404
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,680
What if they don't like me?

405
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,120
- They'll love you. -They will.

406
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,560
Once they understand you.

407
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,750
They just haven't met anyone like you before.

408
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,370
Okay.

409
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,700
The Volturi will come for all of us.

410
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,130
You get that thing out of here.

411
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,230
She's not what she looks like.

412
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,600
This is a crime!

413
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,090
Stay back!

414
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,730
She has blood in her veins.

415
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,220
You can feel her warmth.

416
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,640
I can feel it.

417
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
I'm her biological father.

418
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,880
- Bella is her mother. -lmpossible.

419
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,650
It's true. She was born while I was still human.

420
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,890
I've never heard of such a thing.

421
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,120
She can show you, if you let her.

422
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,100
Tanya, you owe us this much.

423
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,000
We're all under a death sentence because your sister didn't let us explain.

424
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,320
Don't be afraid.

425
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,830
This is how she communicates.

426
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,490
It's true.

427
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,430
She's not immortal.

428
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,940
I knew the rest of our family would face this fear as well.

429
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,660
Fear of the unknown.

430
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,370
Fear of the Volturi.

431
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,190
Amun, please!

432
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,100
I cannot help you, Carlisle.

433
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,800
I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.

434
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,630
You must go.

435
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,930
I'd like to hear about it.

436
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,970
I never get to meet any of Amun's friends.

437
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,470
He likes to keep me hidden.

438
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,700
I can't imagine why.

439
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,700
- Carlisle.

440
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,370
-Benjamin.

441
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,650
Benjamin can influence the elements.

442
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,330
And here I get super self-control.

443
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,490
Who are they?

444
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,290
Senna and Zafrina.

445
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,420
From the Amazon.

446
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,190
The arrival of Senna and Zafrina meant that our plea was being heard

447
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,720
in even the most remote corners of the world

448
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,050
while others searched for witnesses closer to home.

449
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,750
A patriot Carlisle first met on the battlefield at Yorktown

450
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,980
would become our most unlikely ally.

451
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,720
Shut up!

452
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,630
I hated the first British lnvasion.

453
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,700
And I hate the second one even more.

454
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,480
Even the Beatles?

455
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,510
Really, Garrett?

456
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,730
Old habits die hard.

457
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,030
Carlisle needs you.

458
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,070
Sounds interesting.

459
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,280
Help!

460
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,110
But first I'd better finish my meal.

461
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,350
Help me! Help!

462
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,660
Each of them was won over.

463
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,670
Each was made to see.

464
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,790
Carlisle convinced his lrish friends to make the journey to Forks.

465
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,740
Although we were grateful for their help,

466
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,370
their thirst for human blood complicated the situation.

467
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,790
The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable.

468
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,500
Especially Peter

469
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,560
who had fought alongside Jasper as a newborn.

470
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,950
Lotta red eyes around here.

471
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,680
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

472
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,250
But they'll feed somewhere.

473
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,340
As more vampires set foot in their territory,

474
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,770
more Quileutes turned.

475
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,070
Their nature compelling them to join the pack.

476
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,590
Hey, easy there. Hey!

477
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,260
it's all right.

478
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,420
You're gonna be okay.

479
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,470
Finally, Carlisle and Esme returned with our last witness.

480
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,690
- How many came? - Eighteen.

481
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,020
You have some good friends.

482
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,750
And Alice?

483
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,670
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

484
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,370
Centuries on the run. That's what you've brought me.

485
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,640
Some friend, Carlisle.

486
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,450
Alistair, come meet everyone.

487
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,060
I already told you, if it comes to a fight, I won't stand against the Volturi.

488
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,390
It won't come to a fight.

489
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,490
I'll be in the attic.

490
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,920
He's not a people person.

491
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,020
We opened our home to 1 8 vampires.

492
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,160
Many with gifts of their own.

493
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,000
Zafrina had power over the mind.

494
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,270
She could make anyone see what she wanted them to.

495
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,870
If she weren't holding my hand right now, I could swear this was real.

496
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,270
I don't see anything.

497
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,550
Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

498
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,250
What's a shield?

499
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,320
The ones I've met are so different.

500
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,500
It's a defensive talent.

501
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,310
It's why I couldn't read your mind, even before.

502
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,780
It's why Aro couldn't.

503
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,750
You have a very powerful gift.

504
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,890
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

505
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,450
Shoulda put her on her ass.

506
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,390
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

507
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,460
Maybe it only works on the weak.

508
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,750
Garrett, I wouldn't.

509
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,290
You are an amazing woman.

510
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,910
Now, you guys can do some serious damage.

511
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,350
Which is why you'll need to control your phasing.

512
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,090
If your mom pisses you off,

513
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,290
you don't want to tear her head off.

514
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,880
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.

515
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,450
Vladimir, Stefan,

516
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,720
you're a long way from home.

517
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,700
What are they doing here?

518
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,140
We heard the Volturi were moving against you.

519
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,300
But that you would not stand alone.

520
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,550
We didn't do what we were accused of.

521
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,070
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

522
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,520
We have been waiting a millennium

523
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,620
for the ltalian scum to be challenged.

524
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,410
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

525
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,930
Shame.

526
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,870
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

527
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,810
They enjoy a good fight.

528
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,350
Aro's witnesses?

529
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,380
Aww.

530
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,060
Still hoping they'll listen?

531
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,910
When Aro wants someone from a coven

532
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,120
it's never long before evidence turns up proving that coven committed some crime.

533
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,690
So he's done this before?

534
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,090
It happens so rarely, I never realized it was a pattern.

535
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:48,140
Apparently he always pardons one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

536
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,930
This person always has an ability.

537
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,510
And they're always given a place with the Guard.

538
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,480
This is all about Alice.

539
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,150
- He has no one like her. -Which is why she left.

540
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,460
Why does he need witnesses?

541
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,150
To spread the word that justice has been served.

542
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,360
After he slaughters an entire coven.

543
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,280
Benjamin, Tia,

544
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,570
-we're leaving. -And where will you go?

545
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,350
What makes you think they'll be satisfied with Alice?

546
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,830
What's to stop them from going after Benjamin next?

547
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,800
Or Zafrina or Kate

548
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,140
or anyone else with a gift? Anyone they want.

549
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,170
Their goal isn't punishment, it's power.

550
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,410
It's acquisition.

551
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,640
Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will.

552
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,480
For the sake of my family. But also for yours.

553
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,590
And for the way you want to live.

554
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,640
The packs will fight.

555
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,370
We've never been afraid of vampires.

556
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,820
We Will fight.

557
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,120
This won't be the first time I fought a king's rule.

558
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,540
We'll join you.

559
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,730
No.

560
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,570
I will do the right thing, Amun.

561
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,670
You may do as you please.

562
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,360
We will stand with you.

563
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,520
So will we.

564
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,830
That didn't take much.

565
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,040
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

566
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:16,940
We'll see.

567
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,870
Everyone showed courage.

568
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,140
Though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us.

569
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,380
Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane.

570
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,320
And worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec

571
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,290
who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.

572
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,770
I refused him!

573
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,570


574
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,650
Alec?

575
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,340
I will never go against you.

576
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,360
Of course not,

577
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,210
my dear Toshiro.

578
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,310
It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.

579
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,770
Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.

580
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,520
Sad,

581
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,450
isn't it?

582
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,830
Aro will want us incapacitated before he attacks.

583
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,710
Jane and Alec will try and take me out first because I can anticipate their moves.

584
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,800
Too bad we don't all have your shield.

585
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,520
Doesn't help me fight, though.

586
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,950
No, but you could help the rest of us,

587
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,080
if you could project it.

588
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,220
What do you mean?

589
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,990
I mean shield someone other than yourself.

590
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,830
Is that possible?

591
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,300
Gifts can be developed. Over time.

592
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,640
At first, mine was just in my palms.

593
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,540
Now I can radiate it all over my body.

594
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,570
How do you do it?

595
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,710
- Tell me. -Ow.

596
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,380
You need to visualize it.

597
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,150
See how it moves.

598
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,260
What color it is.

599
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,440
Now picture it expanding.

600
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,710
Will it to go beyond you.

601
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,830
I think she needs something to motivate her.

602
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,130
- No. -it's all right, I can take it.

603
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,470
He says that now.

604
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,990
Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.

605
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,670
Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.

606
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,250
I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.

607
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,960
Dude, you're not motivating her.

608
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,950
You want to try?

609
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,470
Kate!

610
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,520
You seem to lack incentive.

611
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,320
Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?

612
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,890
Are you crazy?

613
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,470
All right.

614
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,730
This one's on full power.

615
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,370
It's painful, but it's bearable.

616
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:48,990
Okay, we should go again.

617
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,180
Emmett.

618
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:53,790
I'm good.

619
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,270
"There's sweet music here that..."

620
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:00,640
"softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass."

621
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,720
"Or night dews on still waters between walls..."

622
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,060
"of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass."

623
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:15,270
"Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."

624
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,300
Mom.

625
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,530
Hmm?

626
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,020
Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away

627
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,640
because we're gonna die?

628
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,260
No.

629
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,400
I think they left to keep us safer.

630
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,470
That's what all these other people are here for, too.

631
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,880
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

632
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,440
Come here. Go to sleep.

633
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,690


634
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,350
It's strange.

635
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,320
Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank.

636
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,960
Mentally, I just feel drained.

637
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,970
How about a bath?

638
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,260
I do remember how to undress myself.

639
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,120
Yeah, I just do it so much better.

640
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,300
Bella,

641
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,650
I've had a bad habit of underestimating you.

642
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,890
Every obstacle you've faced,

643
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,170
I'd think you couldn't overcome it.

644
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,450
And you just did.

645
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,920
You're the reason they have something to fight for.

646
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,160
My family.

647
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,590
I'm gonna get the water running.

648
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,550


649
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,700


650
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,510
Alice made sure only I would get the message.

651
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,910
Because only my mind would be safe from Aro.

652
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,890
I'm surprised you took a break from Jedi training.

653
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:50,000
If I don't take Renesmee to my dad, he'll come to us.

654
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,880
27 vampires, one human.

655
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,270
Not so great.

656
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,580
I know that's what you told Edward.

657
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,490
Whatever.

658
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,500
I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.

659
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,510
I'm sorry.

660
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,310
I know.

661
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,180
They're the good guys.

662
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,030
But come on,

663
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,300
Dracula One and Two are

664
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,470
creepy.

665
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:42,970
There she is. Come here. Oh!

666
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,680
Wow! Look at you.

667
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,340
You've grown half a foot!

668
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,460
Seriously.

669
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,020
Like 6 inches.

670
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,770
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

671
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,060
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

672
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,270
I've actually got a few errands to run, guys.

673
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,810
I'll be back soon, okay?

674
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,210
Come on. Let's go.

675
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,600
Alice's note gave me a new sense of hope.

676
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,330
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

677
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,480
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

678
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,760
I'm meeting Mr. Jenks. Right this way.

679
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,510
-Mrs. Cullen. -Hi.

680
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,310
I'm so happy you called.

681
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,150
I always meet my private clients here.

682
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,010
It's more comfortable than the office.

683
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,290
And it's more public.

684
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,500
Ah. What type of work do you do, J.?

685
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,770
Oh, you know, this and that.

686
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,570
It's always different, which keeps it interesting.

687
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,950
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

688
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,130
I've been working with them for more than 20 years.

689
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:34,100
And my late partner knew Jasper 1 5 years before that.

690
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,900
He is, uh,

691
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,370
unusually well-preserved.

692
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,580
Yes, he is.

693
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,790
I trust that Mr. Jasper is enjoying his vacation.

694
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,610
He didn't tell you where he was going, did he?

695
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,910
No,no,no, he just mentioned that he was leaving

696
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,610
when he came by to place his order.

697
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,090
I assume that his order is ready?

698
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,390
Of course.

699
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,020
I've never been late with a delivery.

700
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,470
There a problem?

701
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,200
No.

702
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,290
My husband and I thought that we'd all be traveling together.

703
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,380
Jasper said only two were traveling.

704
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,270
His instructions were very clear.

705
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,760
It's my mistake.

706
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,360
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

707
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,250
Alice's vision was clear.

708
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,620
Renesmee would have a future.

709
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,500
But Edward and I wouldn't be a pan' of it.

710
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,320
How ya doin'?

711
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,530
"My dearest Renesmee..."

712
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,730
"l thought we would have forever together."

713
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,770
"But forever isn't as long as I 'd hoped."

714
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,040
"l know now why Alice left me clues."

715
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,140
"ltwas to keep you safe."

716
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,380
"Everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack."

717
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,230
"Jacob will protect you."

718
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,200
"And he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends."

719
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,940
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

720
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,980
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

721
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:23,260
I must admit, you even had me believing.

722
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,970
For a moment.

723
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,280
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

724
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,120
Cheers.

725
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,370
The snow is sticking.

726
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,580
Hey, we still have today.

727
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,840
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.

728
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,940
Bella, no one's giving up here.

729
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,910
All right! Present time! Let's go!

730
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,460
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

731
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,070
Jake, you start. Get it going.

732
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,240
What did you get me? I'm not giving you anything.

733
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,710
Hey! No, come on, what did you get me?

734
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:19,470
Well, Dad, we didn't have time to wrap yours, but here it is.

735
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,730
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

736
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,030
It's for you and Sue.

737
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,140
You leave tomorrow.

738
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,410
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

739
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,950
Tomorrow?. I can't leave tomorrow.

740
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,680
I made arrangements for you at work.

741
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,210
Sneaky.

742
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,830
And extravagant.

743
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,290
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

744
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,600
You two trying to get rid of me?

745
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,640
Because it's working!

746
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,160
Fraser River. That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

747
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,490
We might even hook a Rainbow or some Bulls.

748
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,130
Woman knows her trout.

749
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,670
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

750
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,740
Jacob make this for you?

751
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,850
Wanna put it on?

752
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,300
It's so pretty.

753
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,960
It is really pretty.

754
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,340
That's what I'm talkin' about.

755
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,050
A little pre-battle bonfire.

756
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,620
Telling war stories.

757
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,300
Or just standing there like frickin' statues.

758
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,920
Name any American battle. I was there.

759
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,090
Little Bighorn.

760
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,140
I came this close to biting Custer.

761
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,230
But the lndians got him first.

762
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,410
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

763
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,510
He didn'twin that one on his own.

764
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,790
If you're talking battles, you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

765
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,600
No one does rebellion like the lrish.

766
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,370
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

767
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,810
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

768
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:33,050
When we ruled, everything came to us.

769
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:34,290
P FEY,

770
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,720
diplomats,

771
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,860
favor seekers.

772
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,830
Such was our power.

773
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:43,840
But we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.

774
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,850
We were honest about what we were.

775
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,550
We sat still for a very long time.

776
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,920
We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.

777
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,070
Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they

778
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,040
burned our castles.

779
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,920
We've been waiting 1,500 years

780
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,680
to return that favor.

781
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,350
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

782
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,570
I can't help thinking,

783
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,310
all these people are putting themselves in danger

784
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,010
because I fell in love with a human.

785
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,450
You found your mate.

786
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,140
You deserve to be happy.

787
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,520
But atwhat cost?

788
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,830
Everyone here has something to fight for.

789
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,130
I certainly do.

790
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,160
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

791
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,630
For this extraordinary life.

792
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:08,440
This means "More than my own life."

793
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,840
That's how much I love you.

794
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,340
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob.

795
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,710
No matterwhat.

796
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,720
Even if I tell him that...

797
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,690
That he has to take you somewhere.

798
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,710
Hey.

799
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,810
Baby, it's all right.

800
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,720
You're gonna be safe.

801
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,950
Always.

802
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,220
If we live through this,

803
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,360
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

804
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,100
Now you tell me.

805
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,930
The Redcoats are coming! The Redcoats are coming!

806
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,640
Aro's looking for Alice.

807
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,610
Aro,

808
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,910
Iet us discuss things as we used to.

809
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,420
In a civilized manner.

810
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,580
Fairwords, Carlisle.

811
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,660
But a little out of place,

812
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:40,100
given the battalion you've assembled against us.

813
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,970
I can promise you, thatwas never my intent.

814
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,610
No laws have been broken.

815
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,340
We see the child.

816
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,680
Do not treat us as fools.

817
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,840
She is not an lmmortal!

818
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,290
These witnesses can attest to that.

819
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,330
Or you can look.

820
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,340
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

821
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,740
Artifice!

822
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:07,440
I will collect every facet of the truth.

823
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,720
But from someone more central to the story.

824
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,060
Edward,

825
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:18,530
as the child clings to your newborn mate,

826
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,970
I assume you are involved.

827
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,020
I'd like to meet her.

828
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,900
Ah.

829
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,900
Young Bella.

830
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,210
Immortality becomes you.

831
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:51,230
I hear her strange heart.

832
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,980
Hello, Aro.

833
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,360
Magnifico!

834
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,580
Half mortal,

835
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,050
half immortal.

836
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:47,320
Conceived and carried by this

837
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,160
newborn

838
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,070
while she was still human.

839
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,360
Impossible!

840
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,640
Do you think they fooled me, brother?

841
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,990
Bring the informer forward.

842
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,020
Is that the child you saw?

843
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,240
I'm not sure.

844
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,610
Jane.

845
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:35,350
She's changed. This child is bigger.

846
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,590
Then your allegations were false.

847
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:39,630
The Cullens are innocent.

848
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,560
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

849
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,940
I'm sorry.

850
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,050
Caius, no!

851
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,160
Irina!

852
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:12,090
Blind them.

853
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,540
Give me my sight back.

854
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,310
Tanya, this is what they want.

855
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:23,040
If you attack now, we'll all die.

856
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:46,650
Pain.

857
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:23,930
It's working.

858
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,700
Aro, you see there's no law broken here.

859
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:01,880
Agreed.

860
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,520
But does it then follow

861
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,180
that there is no danger?

862
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,960
For the first time in our history

863
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,920
humans pose a threat

864
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,820
to our kind.

865
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,590
Their modern technology

866
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,760
has given birth to weapons that could destroy us.

867
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,440
Maintaining our secret

868
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,110
has never been more imperative.

869
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,720
In such perilous times,

870
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,370
only the known

871
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,700
is safe.

872
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,210
Only the known

873
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:51,610
is tolerable.

874
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,150
And we know nothing

875
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:58,020
of what this child will become.

876
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:04,060
Can we live with such uncertainty?

877
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:08,270
Spare ourselves a fight today,

878
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:13,160
only to die

879
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,350
tomorrow.

880
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,950
No.

881
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:30,050
Alice.

882
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,820
Alice!

883
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:49,260
My dear, dear Alice,

884
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,330
we're so glad to see you here, after all.

885
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,790
I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.

886
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,200
Let me show you.

887
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,740
Brother?

888
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,560
it doesn't matter what I show you.

889
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,340
Even when you see.

890
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,980
You still won't change your decision.

891
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,060
Now!

892
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,140
Take care of my daughter.

893
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,790
Get them.

894
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:17,130
Hmm!

895
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,120
Take her away.

896
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,820
Let her go!

897
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,300
Jacob!

898
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,570
Jacob!

899
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,140
Jacob!

900
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,480
Jacob!

901
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,420
Watch out!

902
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,180
Bella!

903
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:12,990
Finally.

904
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,720
Now you know.

905
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,850
That's your future.

906
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:12,330
Unless you decide on another course.

907
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:16,270
We cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.

908
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,880
But what if you were sure she could remain concealed from the human world?

909
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,560
Could we leave in peace?

910
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,890
Of course. But that cannot be known.

911
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,090
Actually, it can.

912
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,380
I've been searching for witnesses of my own

913
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,990
among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

914
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:11,510
- We have enough witnesses. -Let him speak, brother.

915
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:14,530
I am half human,

916
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,500
halfvampire.

917
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:19,100
Like the Child.

918
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:21,950
A vampire seduced my mother,

919
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,080
who died giving birth to me.

920
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,980
My aunt Huilen

921
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,320
raised me as her own.

922
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,720
I made her immortal.

923
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:33,960
How old are you?

924
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,970
150 years.

925
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:44,120
At what age did you reach maturity?

926
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,720
I became full-grown seven years after my birth.

927
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:50,800
I have not changed since then.

928
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:57,180
And your diet?

929
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,520
Blood,

930
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,610
human food.

931
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,390
I can survive on either.

932
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:07,070
These children are much like us.

933
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:09,840
Regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves.

934
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,600
Our natural enemies.

935
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,070
Dear ones,

936
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:30,140
there is no danger here.

937
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,920
We will not fight

938
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,980
today.

939
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,380
Such a prize.

940
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,430
We have them on the run. Now is the time to attack.

941
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,560
Not today.

942
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,710
You're all fools!

943
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:20,610
The Volturi might be gone.

944
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:23,290
But they will never forgive

945
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:24,720
what happened here.

946
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,410
You have a beautiful family.

947
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:35,490
She's gonna be around for a long time, isn't she?

948
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,270
A very long time.

949
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,070
I'm glad she has you.

950
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,690
So should I start calling you "Dad"?

951
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,160
No.

952
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,240
Hey.

953
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,150
Hey.

954
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,370
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

955
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:00,160
I wanna show you something.

956
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:03,800
What?

957
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:35,930
I'm Edward Cullen.

958
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:35,720
How did you do that?

959
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,190
Been practicing.

960
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,640
Now you know.

961
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:49,110
Nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.

962
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:51,980
There's one exception.

963
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:04,710
Will you show me again?

964
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,610
We've got a lotta time.

965
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,230
Forever.

966
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,660
Forever.

967
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:43,150


968
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:47,170


969
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,460


970
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:51,240


971
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,050


972
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:54,450


973
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:55,950


974
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,280


975
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:58,720


976
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,590


977
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,580


978
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:04,400


979
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:07,510


980
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:09,530


981
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,940


982
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,580


983
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:17,050


984
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,230


985
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:21,260


986
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,870


987
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:27,440


988
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,980


989
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:31,680


990
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,590


991
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,790


992
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:39,590


993
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:42,230


994
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,910


995
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,250


996
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,590


997
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,320


998
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:54,990


999
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:57,740


1000
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:00,410


1001
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:03,640


1002
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,450


1003
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:07,320


1004
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:10,020


1005
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,690


1006
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,330


1007
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:17,940


1008
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:20,680


1009
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,280


1010
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:25,950


1011
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:28,590


1012
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:31,340


1013
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:33,540


1014
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:35,680


1015
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:38,050


1016
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,620


1017
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,920


1018
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,470


1019
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:47,830


1020
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:50,840


1021
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,250


1022
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:57,920


1023
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,430


1024
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,870


1025
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:05,430

01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,400


1027
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:11,680


1028
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:14,680


1029
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,920


1030
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,060


1031
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:24,340

01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:43,680
