2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,270
女孩子永远不会忘记自己喜欢上的第一个男孩
A girl will never forget the first boy she likes.

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,920
即使事情不尽人意
Even if things don't quite work out.

4
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,550
为什么推我?
Why did you do that?

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,820
因为你闻起来像狗便便
Because you smell like dog poo.

6
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,720
你蠢得像狗便便
You're so stupid,just like dog poo.

7
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,290
你是狗便便做的!
You're made out of poo!

8
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,990
但总有人为你排疑解惑
But usually someone is there to offer words of wisdom.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,700
宝贝...
Honey...

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,110
... 知道为什么那男孩要那样做 那样说吗?
... do you know why that little boy did those things and said those things?

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,110
因为他喜欢你
It's because he likes you.

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,510
就是这个
And there it is.

17
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,310
这就是我们问题的开始
That's the beginning of our problem.

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,620
那个小男孩欺负你 是因为他喜欢你
That little boy is doing those terrible things because he's got a crush on you.

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,130
知道这意味着什么吗?
Do you know what this means?

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,980
我相信他只是弄丢了你的号码
I'm sure he just lost your number.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,120
他不约你是因为 他被你成功的事业吓到了
He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,870
相信我 因为他刚结束了一段认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,070
相信我 因为他从没有过认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship.

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,670
喂 是我
Hey,it's me.

55
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,280
他很可爱 进展很顺利
He's cute,and I think it went well.

57
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,250
喂 是我 我只想告诉你我想你
Hey,it's me. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you.

68
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,380
好吧
Okay.

69
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,820
待会儿打给你
Let me call you right back.

70
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,010
好的
All right.

73
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,230
谢谢
Thank you.

78
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,510
恭喜 你中了
Congratulations,you won.

79
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,540
什么?
What?

82
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,320
不是开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,660
我不开玩笑
I don't do kidding.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
上帝 我简直不敢相信 太棒了
Oh,my God. I can't believe this,it's so exciting.

85
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,770
天呐 我从没中过奖
Oh,my God. I never won anything before.

89
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,270
谢谢! 过来
Thank you! Come here.

90
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,770
哇
Wow.

100
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,880
22分钟前
That was 22 minutes ago.

102
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,040
你要打给她? 千万不要
Should you call back? No,absolutely not.

103
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,720
我就告诉她 我要上床睡觉了
I'm gonna call back and say I'm going to bed.

105
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,990
不 这是个好主意
No,it's a great idea.

116
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,120
我这样说了?
Is that what I was saying?

118
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,920
上帝 我竟然谈那么沉重的话题
God,that's kind of heavy for a grocery chat.

121
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,370
我有个朋友专门接手音乐方面的客户
I know a guy at my office who deals exclusively with music clients.

123
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,470
噢 上帝
Oh,my God.

130
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,360
我不能这样做
I don't do this.

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,450
嗯
Hm.

139
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,920
好吧
Yeah.

140
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,660
很好 非常感谢
Great,thank you so much.

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,240
好了
Okay.

156
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,340
真的?
Really?

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,910
是的
Yeah.

158
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
很好啊
Great.

159
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
你真觉得好?
You really think that's great?

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,540
是的
Yeah.

168
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,310
你我只是两个 碰巧都没结婚的人
You and I are just two people who happen not to be married.

170
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,410
你真古怪
You are so weird.

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,570
想想你和你的朋友 好吗?
Think about you and your friends. Okay?

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,620
对 你是对的
Yes,you're right.

190
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,730
你是对的
You're right.

193
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
您没有留言
You have no messages.

204
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,840
来杯咖啡?
You want coffee?

206
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,580
这都怪你
This is all your fault.

210
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,090
这可不是撮合
That's not a setup.

211
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,070
我要撮合两个人 会先权衡利弊
When I do a setup,I weigh the pros and cons.

215
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,720
他说他下班后常去城市夜总会
He said he always hangs out after work at the City Supper Club.

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,120
也许我可以来个刚好路过?
Maybe I should do a little drive by?

217
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,290
别这样
Please don't.

221
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,860
为什么要发明来电显示?
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

240
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,960
喂?
Hello?

241
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,620
妈妈
Mom.

242
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,730
我等会儿再打给你
I gotta call you back.

245
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,870
抬头看天花板
Look up towards the ceiling.

247
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,920
他完全记得我想要什么
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

255
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,530
好吧 那蛮好的 他会打给你的
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

267
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,860
已经没什么规定了
There are no rules anymore.

281
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,730
回电话给我
Call me.

282
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,380
哦 我是琪琪 回我电话
Oh,this is Gigi. Call me.

283
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,680
别担心 他肯定会打给你的
Don't worry,he's totally gonna call.

284
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,740
什么?
What?

287
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,210
琪琪 你在吗?
Gigi,are you there?

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,750
在吗 琪琪?
Hello,Gigi?

296
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,340
好吧 我就当你默许了 拜拜
All right,I'm interpreting your silence as tacit compliance. Bye.

300
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,230

I'm meeting someone. A guy.

327
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
主意不错
That's a great idea.

328
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,630
需要点什么?
What can I get you?

329
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
哦 不用了 我来见个人

他忘记约了你在这里见面吗?
Did he forget he was supposed to meet you here?

339
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,850
好的 你知道吗? 我打电话给他
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

340
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,190
哦 不 我是说 完全没必要
Oh,no. I mean,just totally unnecessary.

341
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,660

谢谢
Thanks.

350
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,830
那个 我也不好说什么东西对人家重不重要
Look,I'm not going to judge what may or may not be important to someone.

351
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,520
没错 尽管这根本不是他的牙医
Yeah. That's not even his dentist,though.

352
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,430
哦 是嘛 那谁是?
Oh,really. Who is?

353
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,890

367
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,580
因为我是男人 男人都这么做
Because I'm a guy,and it's just how we do it.

368
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,220
他说很高兴认识我
He said it was nice meeting me.

382
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,590
好吧 好吧 但说不定我也是个例外呢?

谢谢 我想我是明白了
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

410
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,720
我们不能再听信这些故事了
We have to stop listening to these stories.

424
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,900
好了 我想想我是不是明白了
Okay,let me just see if I understand.

428
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,740
是的
Yes.

442
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,050
然后他告诉我他结婚了
And then he tells me that he's married.

444
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,850
但我就是忘不了他
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

445
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,220
但他结婚了
But he's married.

448
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,290
好吧
Okay.

449
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,240
我认识一个男人 他是我爸爸复印店里的员工

我是说 如果你遇到了生命中的最爱...
I mean,what if you meet the love of your life...

I know you said you had a couple of contacts you thought could help me.

476

性感和可爱都是外表那一栏的
Sexy and cute are both in the looks column.

492
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,250
谁也不想只具有同一栏的特质
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

493
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,380
尽管我这么说会显得很傻 但显然你四种类型都是
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,which obviously you are.

494
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,750
尤其是性感
Especially sexy.

495
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,760

好吧 呃 你想留的话可以留下
Okay,well,you know you could stay here if you want.

498
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,310
怎么了? 你有一阵子没来了
What? It's been a while.

499
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,210
不 不行
No,I can't.

502
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,940
你没关系吧?
Is that okay?

503
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,550

对吧? 我知道
Right? I know.

523
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,620

We've been together for over seven years.

好

1352
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:59,650

1388
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,390
我很肯定我们之间会发生点什么
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.

1397
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,310
我们分手了
We broke up.

1401
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,660
是呀
Yeah.

1406
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,770
哦 天哪
Oh,my God.

1413
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,220
爸爸 躺下 好不好?
Daddy,lay down,okay?

1415
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,760
大伙 有没有人看见发生什么事了?

要我帮你找东西吗?

1439

谢谢你帮忙搅拌
Thanks for mixing that up.

1441
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,110
什么?
What?

1449
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,580
我想我已经把剩下的啤酒瓶都集中起来了
I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.

1463
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,330
谢谢你留在这里帮我清理
thanks for staying and helping me clean up.

1465
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,130
这是个邀请吗?
Is that an invitation?

1466
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,040
什么?
What?

1468
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,540
哦 我不太擅长这些
Oh,I'm not good at this.

1469
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,110
什么?
What?

1471
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,030
哦 是的 我知道的
Oh,yes. I knew it.

1472
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,260
最好的恋情是发展自友谊的
The best relationships grow out of friendships.

1475
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,810
什么?
What?

1476
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,810
现在你跟我在谈恋爱?
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1481
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,790
是吗 比如什么?
Really,like what?

1486
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,500
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1489
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,170
我约你了吗?
Did I ask you out?

1490
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,540
没有
No.

1491
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,240
你为什么这么做?
Why would you do this?

1492
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,520
哦 该死
Oh,shit.

1496
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,730
我宁愿那样 也不想像你一样
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1498
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,220
那是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

1502
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:06,060
哦 你以为把女人当消费品你就赢了?
Oh,you think you've won because women are expendable to you?

1503
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:10,570
你也许不会伤害到你自己或者让自己出丑.
You may not get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way.

1504
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,430
但同时你那样也不会尝到爱情的滋味
But you don't fall in love that way either.

1505
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:15,340
你没有赢
You have not won.

1507
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,780
我可能做了该死的蠢事.
I may do a lot of stupid shit.

1508
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:31,450
但我知道我会比你更快找到另一半
but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.

1509
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,630
还要别的吗?
Do you want anything else?

1510
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,260
当然 少一些硬纸板 多些人吃的东西
Yeah,less of the cardboard crap and more regular people food.

1511
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,030
嗯 那个硬纸板是我们常说的全麦吐司
Well,that cardboard crap is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1526
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,430
你好吗?
Are you okay?

1527
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:58,610
不要担心 亲爱的 爸爸会没事的
Don't worry,honey,Dad's gonna be fine.

1529
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,050
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

1530
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,890
你要离开他吗?
are you gonna leave him?

1531
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,020
琪琪 他是我老公
Gigi,he's my husband.

1532
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:15,360
他不是那些不给你回电话的男人
He's not some guy who didn't call me back.

1533
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,460
他跟我坦白了
He did admit it to me.

1535
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:24,640
抱歉 我不是那个意思
I'm sorry,I didn't mean that.

1536
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,070
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

1538
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,030
哦 没关系
Oh,it's okay.

1540
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,980
什么?
What?

1543
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,090
是我逼他结婚的
I forced him into getting married.

1548
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,810
当我们第一次见面时我很风趣
I was fun when we first met.

1549
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,100
你现在也很风趣
You're still fun.

1550
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,290
我们不做爱了
We don't have sex anymore.

1553
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:30,840
我们从来没有做爱
we never have sex.

1556
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,650
上帝啊 这瓷砖太小了
God,this tile is too small.

1561
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,140
我第一个老公没什么特别的
my first husband was  unimpressive

1566
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,920
我的第二任丈夫就挺有想象力的
My second husband was a pinch more creative.

1570
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,560
可我的最后一任丈夫 真是个极品
But my last husband,he was a gem.

1571
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:42,640
他是个名副其实的遮谎专家
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.

1577
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:06,330
但是 真正的高手 我不得不说 是我
But the real master,I have to say,is me.

1578
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:12,170
三任丈夫 数不清的情人 却从未被抓到
Three husbands,countless boyfriends,I haven't been caught yet.

1579
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:14,630
噢 上帝啊 噢 上帝啊
Oh,my God. Oh,my God.

1581
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,550
在那边
It's over there.

1582
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,820
噢 天啊
Oh,my God.

1584
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:35,990
难以置信
It's unbelievable.

1588
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,170
谢谢你
Thank you.

1590
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:24,340
你得过会儿再来
You gotta come back later.

1594
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,620
你能到壁橱里躲一会儿吗?
Can you get in the closet?

1604
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:26,100
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1605
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,770
坐下来
Sit down.

1606
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,570
好的
Okay.

1607
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,280
亲爱的?
Hon?

1608
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,220
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1615
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,340
噢 亲爱的
Oh,honey.

1618
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,120
我真的在努力
I'm really trying here.

1619
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:24,520
你想要拯救我们的婚姻吗?
Do you wanna save our marriage?

1620
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,370
当然
Of course.

1621
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:33,530
我也是
Me too.

1628
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:21,880
是啊 他辞职了
Yeah,he quit.

1629
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,160
我们有什么必要开这个会吗?
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?

1632
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,700
散会
Meeting adjourned.

1633
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,630
干活去吧
Back to work.

1635
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,270
有我的电话吗?
Did I get any calls?

1638
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,520
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

1639
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,720
谁啊?
Who?

1641
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:06,090
没什么女孩儿
There's no girl.

1642
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,700
你可藏不住 伙计
You can't hide it,man.

1646
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,170
你无法集中精神 对吧?
You can't focus,right?

1655
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,650
我得把这活儿做完
I gotta finish this stuff.

1656
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:59,250
好吧
Okay.

1658

别说话了
Stop talking.

1709
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,520
怎么了?
What?

1710
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,330
你们有谁要去商店吗?
Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?

1727
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,140
撒谎!
Lying!

1728
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,340
烂人!
Sack!

1729
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,110

只是想知道你过的怎么样
Just wondering how you're doing.

1736
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:14,850
我有段时间没跟你说上话了...
I haven't talked to you in a little while...

1738
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,990
那 嘿 我想跟你谈谈
So,hey,I was hoping to talk to you.

1739
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,990
很显然
Obviously.

1740
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,460
但是你出门了 我猜
But you're out,I guess.

1741

嗯 你还记得这条船吧
Yeah. You remember the boat.

1754
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:22,010
嗯 你知道 我应该是记得的
Well,you know,I thought I did.

1761
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,530
他请我喝了杯白葡萄酒
who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.

1762
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:42,830
噢 不错啊

I know where my life is going,and I want you to go with me.

1828
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,850
我不是在说让你马上就搬进来...
I'm not saying I want you to move in right now...

1831
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,650
那么 你怎么想的呢?
So,what do you think?

1832
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:24,490
