2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,270
女孩子永远不会忘记自己喜欢上的第一个男孩
A girl will never forget the first boy she likes.

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,920
即使事情不尽人意
Even if things don't quite work out.

4
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,550
为什么推我?
Why did you do that?

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,820
因为你闻起来像狗便便
Because you smell like dog poo.

6
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,720
你蠢得像狗便便
You're so stupid,just like dog poo.

7
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,290
你是狗便便做的!
You're made out of poo!

8
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,990
但总有人为你排疑解惑
But usually someone is there to offer words of wisdom.

9
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,400
狗...
Made...

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,930
... 便便...
... of...

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,740
... 做...
... dog...

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,240
... 的
... poo.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,700
宝贝...
Honey...

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,110
... 知道为什么那男孩要那样做 那样说吗?
... do you know why that little boy did those things and said those things?

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,110
因为他喜欢你
It's because he likes you.

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,510
就是这个
And there it is.

17
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,310
这就是我们问题的开始
That's the beginning of our problem.

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,620
那个小男孩欺负你 是因为他喜欢你
That little boy is doing those terrible things because he's got a crush on you.

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,130
知道这意味着什么吗?
Do you know what this means?

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,420
我们被鼓励...
We're all encouraged...

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,760
... 不 被设计...
...no,programmed...

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,460
...去相信 如果一个小子做了令你伤心的事
...to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk...

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,100
... 就表示他喜欢你
...that means he likes you.

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,200
问题就在这儿: 他太喜欢你了
Here's the problem: he likes you too much.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,240
而你太漂亮太能干
You're too pretty and too awesome.

26
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,500
- 嗯  - 他不知所措
- Yes.  - He can't handle it.

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,610
那个Phi Delt显然很喜欢你
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,980
我相信他只是弄丢了你的号码
I'm sure he just lost your number.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,120
他不约你是因为 他被你成功的事业吓到了
He's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,870
相信我 因为他刚结束了一段认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.

31
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,070
相信我 因为他从没有过认真的感情
Trust me. It's because he's never had a serious relationship.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,590
为什么我们这样互相宽慰?
Why do we say this stuff to each other?

33
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,220
难道因为我们太害怕...
Is it possible that it's because we're too scared...

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,590
... 太难说出那个...
...and it's too hard to say the one obvious truth...

35
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,760
... 显而易见的事实?
...that's staring everyone in the face?

36
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,760
其实你不懂他的心

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,640
Janine说你是个房地产经纪人
So Janine says you're a real estate agent.

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,050
对 不过我不是那种低级的人...
Yeah,but I'm not one of those cheesy ones...

39
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,160
...会在公交椅或商店推车上 贴大头广告 
... that puts my headshots on bus benches and grocery carts.

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,660
你贴在飞盘或笔记本上?
So just,like,Frisbees and notepads?

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,850
差不多
Basically.

42
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,930
- 高级多了  - 正是如此
- It's much classier.  - My thoughts exactly.

43
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,300
为什么Janine不早点介绍我们认识
Wonder why Janine never thought to introduce us before.

44
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,240
不知道 不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,470
- 嗨 伙计们 再来一杯?  - 想再来杯吗?
- Hey,guys. Want another round?  - You want one more?

46
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,810
除非你也喝 如果你想喝 我可以...
Only if you do. I mean,if you need to get going,I totally...

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,310
嗯...
Uh...

48
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,080
好吧...
Okay,well...

49
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,280
再来个加苏打的伏特加?
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,750
还有啤酒 谢谢
And a beer,please.

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,790
稍等
Be right back.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,790
- Conor 今晚很愉快  - 认识你很高兴
- Well,Conor,I had a really nice time.  - It was really nice meeting you.

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,400

- Bye.  - See you.

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,670

他很可爱 进展很顺利
He's cute,and I think it went well.

56
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,010
我想这会儿 他正往我家电话留言呢
And I think he might be leaving me a message at home as we speak.

57
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,250
喂 是我 我只想告诉你我想你
Hey,it's me. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you.

Oh,that's very sweet of you,Conor. Thanks.

59
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,520

Listen,I was wondering if you wanted to grab a late bite.

60
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,230
今晚? 我...
Tonight? I...

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,460
不行 我本来要见朋友 但我太累了 别生气
No,I was supposed to meet friends but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,270
我没生气 我会晚点睡
No,of course,I'm not mad. Well,I'll be up for a while.

63
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,340
- 你先来吧?  - 我等你
- Do you wanna go ahead of me?  - I'll be up.

64

- Oh,can you hold on?  - Okay.

65
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,140
不用 你只买了一样东西...
No,that's fine. You just have one thing,so...

66
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,110
严格说 买了六瓶...
No,technically I have six...

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,840
... 我还在琢磨要不要买口香糖 所以你先吧
... and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,so I think you should go.

68
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,380

谢谢
Thank you.

74
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,900
噢 不会吧
Oh,my word.

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,170
啊? 不可能啊
Seriously? That's not possible.

76
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,360
我三天前才存了款 不可能爆卡
I just deposited cash three days ago,so it's just not possible.

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,340
不是说那个 我查查
Oh,it's not that. Let me check something.

78
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,510
恭喜 你中了
Congratulations,you won.

79
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,540

81
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,510
啊?
What?

82
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,320
不是开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,660
我不开玩笑
I don't do kidding.

84
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,500
上帝 我简直不敢相信 太棒了
Oh,my God. I can't believe this,it's so exciting.

85
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,770
天呐 我从没中过奖
Oh,my God. I never won anything before.

86
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,380
这竟是我有生以来最高兴的事 挺悲哀吧
This is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

87
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,470
是... 不 不是
Yea... No. I don't think so.

88
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,050

Terps跑到中场 想进攻
As the Terps move to mid-ice,trying to...

92
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,620
- 嗨  - 嗨

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,760
- 约会怎样?  - 凑合 管它呢
- How was the date?  - It was fine. Whatever.

94
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,900
- 你怎么在这儿?  - 我的闭路断台了了
- Why are you here?  - My cable's out.

95
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,400
加油 Spiewak 这可不是作秀节目
Come on,Spiewak,it's not the Ice Capades.

96
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,330
电话铃有响过吗?
You didn't hear the phone ring by any chance,did you?

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,840
- 没有  - 见鬼
- No,I didn't.  - Shit.

98
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,700
Anna老是那句"呆会儿打给你"
Anna gave me the old,"I'll call you right back."

99
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,940
噢 见鬼 是吗? 多久前?
Oh,shit,yeah? Well,how long ago?

100
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,880
22分钟前
That was 22 minutes ago.

101
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,770
我打给她怎样?
Do I call back?

102
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,040
你要打给她? 千万不要
Should you call back? No,absolutely not.

103
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,720
我就告诉她 我要上床睡觉了
I'm gonna call back and say I'm going to bed.

104
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,650
别 才9:30 你就...?
What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna...?

105
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,990
不 这是个好主意
No,it's a great idea.

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,190
打给她说 "不用给我打电话了...
I'll call and say,"In case you were gonna call me back,don't...

107
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,490
... 因为我要睡了" 绝妙的主意
...because I'll be sleeping." A genius idea.

108
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,930
对 妙极了
Okay,no,that's brilliant.

109
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,300
睡醒后再打电话给她 "我醒了 可以接你的电话了"
When you wake up you can say,"I'm awake now,I'm available to take your call."

110
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,530
噢 稍等
Oh,gosh. A second.

111
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,140
- 很抱歉  - 没关系
- Sorry about that.  - It's all right.

112
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,470
我...
I was...

113
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,440
我说到哪儿了?
Wait,what was I saying again?

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,580
你不愿像你母亲那样 一天醒来...
You don't wanna be like your mother,wake up one morning...

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,690
... 发现自己从未追求过梦想
...and realize you never pursued your dreams.

116
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,120
我这样说了?
Is that what I was saying?

117
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,920
- 来点口香糖?  - 不 谢谢
- You want some gum?  - No,thank you.

118
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,920
上帝 我竟然谈那么沉重的话题
God,that's kind of heavy for a grocery chat.

119
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,320
- 没关系  - 是吗?
- No,that's okay.  - Isn't it?

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,930
- 对不起  - 或许我能帮到你
- Sorry.  - I actually might be able to help.

121
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,370
我有个朋友专门接手音乐方面的客户
Yeah,I know a guy at my office who deals exclusively with music clients.

122
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,630
- 你开玩笑吧?  - 嗯哼
- Are you kidding?  - Uh- uh.

123
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,470
噢 上帝
Oh,my God.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,940
- 你是我的救世主还是什么?  - 不
- Are you my savior or something?  - No.

125
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,940
- 帮我拿一下?  - 好
- Can you hold this for a second?  - Yeah.

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,180
太出人意料了
Oh,this is so unexpected.

127
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,490
好了...
Okay...

128
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,690
我不能...
I don't...

129
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,070
我有老婆
I'm married.

130
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,360
我不能这样做
I don't do this.

131
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,870
你不怎样做? 不帮助困境中的歌手?
You don't do what? You don't help struggling singers?

132
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,080
不帮性感的瑜伽教练...
Not hot yoga instructing singers...

133
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,110
...而且还相当迷人
...who are incredibly charming.

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,450
嗯
Hm.

135
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,320
你可以... 给我你的名片
Well,you could... You could give me your card.

136
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,890
这很合法 对吗? 可以吗?
That's legit,right? Is that allowed?

137
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,150
可以
I could do that.

138
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,090
- 耶  - 那没问题?
- Yeah.  - That'd be okay,right?

139
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,920
好吧
Yeah.

140
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,660
很好 非常感谢
Great,thank you so much.

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,560
没关系 要帮你拎上车吗?
Course. Do you need help to your car?

142
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,000
- 你的车在哪儿?  - 不用 我自己来
- Where'd you park?  - No,I'm fine. It's okay.

143
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,410
- 认识你很高兴  - 嗯
- It was very nice to meet you.  - Yeah.

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,240
好了
Okay.

145
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,350
她是谁?
Who was that?

146
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,720
- 一个潜在的客户  - 哦
- Oh,that was a prospective client.  - Oh.

147
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,020
不错
Okay.

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,230
我和一个女孩说说话 你用不着这样吧
I can talk to a woman. It doesn't have to be like that.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
我没有
No. Absolutely not.

150
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,740
- 开车吧  - 别紧张
- Just drive.  - Relax.

151
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,660
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

152
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,990
- 你好吗  - 很好
- How you doing?  - Good.

153
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,130
- 是吗?  - 是啊 我刚讲完电话
- Yeah?  - Yeah. I just got off the phone.

154
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,330
- 是吗?  - 是啊 跟我妹妹
- Yeah?  - Yeah,with my little sister.

155
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,400
- 她好吗?  - 她要结婚了
- How's she doing?  - She's getting married.

156
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,340
真的?
Really?

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,910
是的
Yeah.

158
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
很好啊
Great.

159
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
你真觉得好?
You really think that's great?

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,540
是的
Yeah.

161
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,840
Devon是个...
Devon seems like...

162
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,750
...很好的男人
... a great guy.

163
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,620
他们结婚了 你觉得很好...
Well,so you think it's great that they're getting married...

164
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,230
... 而我们还没结婚...
...but you don't ever feel like we're going against nature,or something...

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,730
... 你却不觉得违背自然规律?
...by not getting married?

166
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,430
不觉得
No.

167
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,870
猫给猴子喂奶 才是违背自然规律
Going against nature is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

168
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,310
你我只是两个 碰巧都不结婚的人
You and I are just two people who happen not to be married.

169
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,050
告诉你吧 结了婚就不再互相信任了
Let me tell you something. People who get married are not to be trusted.

170
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,410
你真古怪
You are so weird.

171
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,810
真的 知道原因吗?
They're not. You know why?

172
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,720
因为如果你真正的快乐并忠诚于对方...
Because if you are so legitimately happy,honestly...

173
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,590
... 你就不会去搞个婚礼什么的展示一番
...you wouldn't feel the need to make a big show out of it.

174
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,450
不用到处去告诉人家
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

175
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,390
他们结婚是因为没信心...
They do it because they're insecure...

176
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,790
... 他们认为结婚是必须做的事
... and they think getting married's what they're supposed to be doing.

177
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,530
他们在欺骗自己和别人
So they're lying to themselves and to other people.

178
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,030
真的
Seriously.

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,570
想想你和你的朋友 好吗?
Think about you and your friends. Okay?

180
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,940
你们有着非常深厚的友谊...
These women you have great relationships with...

181
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,980
... 你们相识多年 关系亲密
... you're close to them,some of them you've known for years.

182
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,580
但你们不会...
But you don't feel the need...

183
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,190
...花45美元去马里兰州签一张友谊证书
... to write a $45 check to the state of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

184
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,010
- 嗯 不会 我懂你的意思了 - 对吧?
- Yeah. No,I get that.  - Right?

185
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,250
这和你我之间又有什么区别呢?
Why should it be any different,you know,with me and you?

186
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,020
我们很幸福 我爱你 我属于你...
We're very happy,I love you,I'm committed to you...

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,430
... 我们生活很好 不是吗?
... we have a great life,you know?

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,620
对 你是对的
Yes,you're right.

189
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,890
为什么不就这样幸福下去呢?
Why can't we just be happy?

190
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,730
你是对的
You're right.

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,500
- 我再给你倒些茶  - 好
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.  - Okay.

192
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,740
请输入密码...
Please enter your pass...

193
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440

Main menu. To send a message...

195
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,550
好吧 看来他没给你打过电话
Okay,so clearly he hasn't called.

196
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,520
也许他出差去了
Maybe he's away on business.

197
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,720
他卖房子 就在巴尔的摩
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

198
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,230
- 呆在这城里就是他的工作  - 嗯
- Staying in town is his business.  - Right.

199
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,130
好啦 我跟你说
Well,look,let me tell you.

200
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,070
我和Ben初次约会后 他11天没联系过我
After I went out with Ben for the first time,he didn't call me for 11 days.

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,770
11天呐 现在他还不是成了我的好丈夫
Eleven days. And now he's the world's best husband.

202
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,140
这样的事多着呐
That happens all the time.

203
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,540
- 真的吗?  - 真的
- Really?  - Really.

204
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,840
来杯咖啡?
You want coffee?

205
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,480
- 给你加低脂牛奶  - 谢谢
- I got you 2 percent.  - Thanks.

206
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,580
这都怪你
This is all your fault.

207
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,590
啊? 为什么?
What? Why?

208
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
你介绍我们认识的
You set us up.

209
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,300
是你问我有没认识的人 我就给了Conor你的电话
No. You asked me if I know any guys,and I gave Conor your phone number.

210
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,090
这可不是撮合
That's not a setup.

211
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,070
我要撮合两个人 会先权衡利弊
When I do a setup,I weigh the pros and cons.

212
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,300
采取适当行动
I do my due diligence.

213
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,930
关于Conor 我只知道他卖给我们这房子
All I know about Conor is that he sold us this house.

214
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,970
说真的 别打
Seriously,stop.

215
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,720
他说他下班后常去城市夜总会
He said he always hangs out after work at the City Supper Club.

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,120
也许我可以来个刚好路过?
Maybe I should do a little drive by?

217
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,290
别这样
Please don't.

218
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,290
他会打给你的
He'll call.

219
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,290
如果他不给你打电话

220
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,090
好 我有个问题:
Okay,I have a qiestion:

221
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,860
为什么要发明来电显示?
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

222
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,300
嗯 比如 这项服务对谁有用?
It's,like,who is this service helping?

223
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,340
我指 几百年以来..
I mean,for centuries...

224
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,610
也许没那么久 嗯 但很多很多年以前...
Okay,well maybe not centuries,but for,like,a lot and lot of years...

225
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,840
... 人们不知道打来电话的是谁...
... people have been answering their phone,not knowing who it is...

226
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,450
而且据我所知 没人因为那样就活不下去
and as far as I can tell,no one's died from that.

227
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,320
再说如果警方要知道是谁打的电话 他们可以跟踪电话
And it's like if the police wanna know who placed a call,they could trace it.

228
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,980
我是说 这样我就成了什么 警察吗?
I mean,what am I,the police?

229
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,890
一定要知道电话是谁打来的这种心态
This constant obsession with needing to know who's calling all the time

230
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,320
太讨厌了
it's,like,so gross.

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,130
就比如 你拿起电话 看到是谁打来的 心里就明白了
Like,you pick up the phone,you find out who it is,then you know.

232
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,770
这个 就像...
It's,like...

233
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,400
听着 我想说的是...
Look,all I'm saying...

234
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,170
如果一个男人没给我打电话 我可能会
if a guy doesn't call me,I would like to reserve the right

235
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,370
每隔15分钟就打给他一次 直到他接电话为止
to call him at 15-minute intervals until he picks up.

236
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,670
但是 如果他低头看见是我的号码
But if he looks down and sees my numbers

237
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,150
他就会觉得我神经兮兮的
he's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho or something.

238
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,450
但我并不是
Which I'm not.

239
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,320
很明显
Obviously.

240
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,960
喂?
Hello?

241
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,620
妈妈
Mom.

242
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,730
我等会儿再打给你
I gotta call you back.

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
吸气 天狗式动作
Inhale. Upward-facing dog.

244
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,940
抬头看天花板
Look up towards the ceiling.

245
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,870
抬头看天花板
Look up towards the ceiling.

246
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,810
- 那个女侍应过来的时候他特地多点了几杯饮料  - 嗯
- He ordered more drinks for us when the waitress came.  - Ok.

247
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,920
他完全记得我想要什么
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,570
他主动拥抱我 他说很高兴认识我
He initiated the hug. He said it was nice meeting me.

249
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,780
等一下 这是你们约会开始时还是约会结束时?
So wait. This was at the end of the date or the beginning of the date?

250
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,260
约会结束时 怎么了 很重要吗?
End. Why,does it matter?

251
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,760
当然了 如果开始时说"很高兴认识你" 这很正常
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date,that's normal.

252
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,190
但是结束时说"很高兴认识你"就...
"Nice meeting you" at the end of the date...

253
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,260
就是没戏了
It could be a blowoff.

254
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,300
也可能是在约会开始时说的
Maybe it was at the beginning.

255
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,530
好吧 那蛮好的 他会打给你的
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

256
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,140
也可能是结束时说的
Or maybe it was at the end.

257
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,370
可能他就是很高兴认识我啊
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

258
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,030
帮帮忙
Help.

259
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,480
你好 这太折磨人了
Hi. This is torture.

260
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,580
我怎样才能精辟地准确地
How am I supposed to come up with something pithy and dynamic

261
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,220
介绍肉桂果物?
to say about cinnamon blends?

262
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,850
我很难关注什么肉桂
It's hard to focus on nutmeg

263
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,450
这个男人 很可能是我的真命天子
when the guy who might be the guy of my dreams

264
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,920
但他却没给我打电话
refuses to call me.

265
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,690
我第一次和Neil约会之后
After my first date with Neil

266
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,890
我主动打给他的
I called him.

267
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,860
已经没什么规定了
There are no rules anymore.

268
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,630
还有 我是说 你干嘛非得等他主动出击?
And,I mean,why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?

269
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,230
- 响了响了  - 电话通了就会响
- It's ringing.  - That's pretty standard.

270
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,280
- 嘿 这里是Conor家  - 很好! 语音信箱
- Hey,you've reached Conor.  - Yes! Voicemail.

271
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,280
- 请留言 我会尽快回复你  - 笔记
- Leave a message,I'll get back to you.  - Notes.

272
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,280
"嘿 Conor 我是Gigi
"Hey,Conor,it's Gigi.

273
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,420
我就是想 你没打电话给我
I just thought,I hadn't heard from you

274
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,820
女人干嘛非得等男人打给她呢 不是吗?"
and how stupid is it that a gal has to wait for a guy's call anyway,right?"

275
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,950
这是什么意思? 这是什么意思?
What does that say? What's that say?

276
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,130
因为男女是平等的 对吗?
Because we're all equal,right?

277
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,160
而且不仅仅是平等
More than equal.

278
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,170
如今法学院女生可比男生多
More women are accepted into law school now than men.

279
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,770
还有 我是说 不知道你看没看过"日界线"(美国一档爆料节目)
And,I mean,I don't know if you saw that Dateline

280
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,600
如今女人也可以有鸡鸡的 对吧? 那么...
but women practically have penises now,right? So...

281
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,730
回电话给我
Call me.

282
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,380
哦 我是Gigi 回我电话
Oh,this is Gigi. Call me.

283
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,680
别担心 他肯定会打给你的
Don't worry,he's totally gonna call.

284
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,740
什么?
What?

285
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,210
电话怎么没声音? 电话怎么没声音?
How can there not be a dial tone? How can there not be a dial tone?

286
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,800
没声音 回来吧 声音
No dial tone. Come here,dial tone.

287
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,210
Gigi 你在吗?
Gigi,are you there?

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,750
在吗 Gigi?
Hello,Gigi?

289
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,350
- 妈 是你吗?  - 是啊
- Mom,is that you?  - Yes.

290
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,180
- 我现在没法跟你说 等会儿回你电话  - 等一下 我想要你...
- I can't talk now,I'll call you back.  - Wait,I need you to...

291
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,420

293
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,290
Conor没打电话给我
Conor never called

294
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,200
所以我想要正好路过下城市夜总会
so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run in at the City Supper Club.

295
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,270
要阻止我就接电话
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

296
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,340
好吧 我就当你默许了 拜拜
All right,I'm interpreting your silence as tacit compliance. Bye.

297
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,210
- 最近怎么样 小妞?  - 嘿
- What's up,girl?  - Hey.

298
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,550
- 你还好吗?  - 不错
- How are you?  - Good.

299
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,680
打扰一下
Knock,knock.

300
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,230
嘿
Hey.

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,630
那个...
So...

302
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,930
瞧瞧 我们又轮到同一班
here we are. Same shift again.

303
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,370
我知道 我排的工作表 不记得了?
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

304
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,940
哦 我就猜这不是巧合
Well,I figured it was no coincidence.

305
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,970
我...
I had...

306
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,250
那晚过得很开心
a good time the other night.

307
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,910
是啊
Yeah.

308
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,650
十杯龙舌兰酒下肚后你还真疯狂
It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you.

309
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,420
那个 我在想...
So I was thinking...

310
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,690
下班后我们可以...
after work we could...

311
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,760
你知道的...
You know...

312
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:47,460
听我说 Kelli Ann 那晚我们过得很开心
Look,Kelli Ann,what happened between us the other night was fun.

313
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,800
真的很开心
It was definitely fun.

314
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,880
但今晚我们人手不够 我甚至要亲自掌管吧台
But we're way understaffed tonight. I even have to man the bar.

315
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,070
所以我才安排你值班
So that's why I scheduled you.

316
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,110
来工作
To work.

317
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,910
那么...
So...

318
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,020
我们没事了?
Are we good?

319
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,480
- 当然了 我们没事了  - 好的
- Nope,we're good.  - Okay.

320
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,890
嘿 哦 Kelli Ann
Hey,oh,Kelli Ann.

321
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,460
嘿 宝贝 能把门关一下吗? 谢谢
Hey,babe,could you get the door? Thanks.

322
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,810
你好 是来吃晚餐的 还是?
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner,or?

323
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,310
我来见个人 一个男人
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

324
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,940
- 何必呢?  - 嗯?
- Why?  - Hm?

325
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,980
没什么 抱歉 来吃饭?
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

326
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,770
我在吧台等他
I'll wait at the bar.

327
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
主意不错
That's a great idea.

328
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,630
需要点什么?
What can I get you?

329
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
哦 不用了 我来见个人
Oh,no,I'm meeting someone.

330
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,060
哦 是嘛? 所谓的燃情约会么?
Oh yeah? What,you got a hot date?

331
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,800
我不知道能不能算得上"燃情"
I don't know if you'd call it "hot."

332
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,230
Conor和我才约了一次会...
This guy Conor and I have only been out one time...

333
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,000
等等等一下 Conor Barry?
Wait,wait,wait. Conor Barry?

334
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,470
是的
Yeah.

335
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,630
Conor今晚不会来了 谢谢
Conor's not coming in tonight. Thanks a lot.

336
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,370
他忘记约了你在这里见面吗?
Did he forget he was supposed to meet you here?

337
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,420
哦 那个 我说的"见个人" 意义很宽泛
Oh,see,when I said "meeting someone," I guess it was kind of a broad term.

338
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,610
"见个人"有很多种解释
A wide interpretation of the word "meeting."

339
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,850
好的 你知道吗? 我打电话给他
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

340
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,190
哦 不 我是说 完全没必要
Oh,no. I mean,just totally unnecessary.

341
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,660
好吧
Okay.

342
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,630
我只是刚好在附近
I just was actually in the area

343
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,060
顺便过来看看他在不在
and so I just figured I'd swing by and see if he was around.

344
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,540
因为我要还他这支笔
Because I had to return his pen.

345
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,800
还他这支笔 他落下的
Had to return this pen. He left this.

346
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,940
我想我要早点还给他 免得他抓狂
And I just thought I should really return it before he,you know,freaks out.

347
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,540
哦 好的 我帮你给他
Yeah. Okay,I'll get it to him.

348
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,540
谢谢
Thanks.

349
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,390
"Wilson Ward 牙科学博士 儿童 成人 中老年牙医"
"Wilson Ward,DDS,Adult,Child and Geriatric Dentistry."

350
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,830
那个 我也不好说什么东西对人家重不重要
Look,I'm not going to judge what may or may not be important to someone.

351
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,520
没错 尽管这根本不是他的牙医
Yeah. That's not even his dentist,though.

352
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,430
哦 是嘛 那谁是?
Oh,really. Who is?

353
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,890
我爸
My dad.

354
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,130
噢
Oh.

355
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,680
我叫Gigi 我上周和Conor约过会
I'm Gigi. I went out with Conor last week.

356
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,250
然后我...
And I just...

357
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,850
想看看是否会碰到他
I thought if I just ran into him...

358
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,780
我不知道 我要走了
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

359
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,590
等等
Wait.

360
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,790
等等 就...
Wait,just...

361
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,060
再等几秒钟 我请你喝杯东西
Hang out for a second. Let me buy you a drink.

362
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,790
就一杯 好吗?
One drink. Okay?

363
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,900
稍等一会 我马上回来
Give me two seconds,I'll be right back.

364
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,640
你看起来满理智的 我就实话跟你说吧
Look,you seem like a cool girl,so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

365
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,110
Conor不会打给你的
Conor's never gonna call you.

366
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,880
哦 是吗 你怎么知道?
Oh,really. How do you know?

367
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,580
因为我是男人 男人都这么做
Because I'm a guy,and it's just how we do it.

368
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,220
他说很高兴认识我
He said it was nice meeting me.

369
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,910
我不管他有没有说你是他最爱的女人
I don't care if he said you were his favorite female...

370
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,420
除了他妈妈和Joanie Cunningham(美剧'欢乐时光'女主角)
since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham.

371
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,760
但有一星期了吧 Gigi? 他都没打给你
Over a week went by,okay,Gigi? And he didn't call you.

372
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,560
但也许他打了 我没收到口信
But maybe he did call and I didn't get the message.

373
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,130
也许他弄丢了我的号码
Or maybe he lost my number

374
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,330
也许他出城了 也许他被车撞了 说不定他奶奶去世了
or he's out of town,or got hit by a cab,or his grandma died.

375
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,500
也说不定他没打是因为没兴趣再见你
Or he didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.

376
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,110
好 但我朋友Terri就和一个没给她打电话的人约会过
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went out with a guy who never called.

377
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,840
她完全忘记了他
She totally wrote him off.

378
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,710
- 一年多以后  - 好吧
- Over a year goes by.  - Right.

379
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,550
她碰巧遇到了他 最后他们...
She ran into him,and it ended up that...

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,380
你的朋友Terri是个白痴 同时也是个例外
Your friend Terri's an idiot. She's also the exception

381
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,550
是概率极小的例外
by the way. The rare exception.

382
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,590
好吧 好吧 但说不定我也是个例外呢?
Okay. Okay. But what if I'm the exception?

383
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,530
不 你不是 你不是例外 实际上 你是普遍情况
No,you're not. You're not at all. In fact,you're the rule.

384
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,100
普遍情况就是 男人没打给你 是因为他不想打给你
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't call you,he doesn't wanna call you.

385
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,900
- 真的?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

386
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,870
- 一直是这样?  - 是的 一直是的
- Always?  - Yeah,always.

387
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,070
听我说 我知道该怎样甩掉一个女人 懂吗?
Look,I know what blowing off a woman looks like,okay?

388
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,710
我是老手 经验丰富
I do it early,I do it often.

389
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,340
所以相信我 如果一个男人表面上对你不怎么在乎
So trust me when I say if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit

390
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,010
他就真的不在乎你
he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

391
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,050
没有例外
No exceptions.

392
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,960
谢谢
Thank you.

393
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,260
你说的我会好好想想
Given me a lot to think about.

394
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,610
- 早晨好 早晨好  - 借过
- Morning,morning.  - Excuse me.

395
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,940
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

396
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,380
一切都还好吗?
Everything okay?

397
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,670
哦 我昨晚一夜没睡
Oh,I was up all night.

398
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,870
求你告诉我你是在在忙肉桂的材料
Please say you were working on the nutmeg copy.

399
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,180
当然了 基本搞定了 我有件重要的事要说
Sure. It's basically done. I have to tell you something important.

400
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,220
宝贝? 你的头发怎么了?
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

401
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,720
是啊 到这边来 免得他们看到你的头上有块小松饼
Yeah,come here before people see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

402
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,560
好吧
Okay.

403
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,060
那个...
So...

404
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,400
谢谢 我想我是明白了
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

405
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,700
还记得那个对我劈腿的公务员吗?
Remember that notary public who cheated on me?

406
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,170
Anastasia告诉我她男朋友起初也对她劈腿
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning

407
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,440
但后来他变了 现在他们结婚了 深陷爱河
but then he changed and now they're married and crazy in love?

408
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,480
- 我以为他只是个技术师呢  - 不 公证员
- I thought that guy was a process server.  - No,notary.

409
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,580
不管怎样 我想说 Anastasia是个例外 不是普遍情况
Anyway,my point is,Anastasia's the exception,not the rule.

410
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,720
我们不能再听信这些童话了
We have to stop listening to these stories.

411
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,950
实际真理是 出轨的男人根本不在乎你
The rule is that guys who cheat on you don't care about you much.

412
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,350
- 好吧  - 好的 案例A:
- Okay.  - Okay,so Exhibit A:

413
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,330
Chad 住在仓库里的鼓手
Chad,the drummer who lived in a storage space.

414
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,330
他只是把我当司机 我却整个1998年都在跟踪他
He only used me for rides,and yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

415
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,030
还有... 哦 那个Don
And then... Oh,there was Don

416
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,770
他每逢周五就要和我分手 这样他就可以过自在的周末
who broke up with me every Friday so that he could have his weekends free.

417
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,840
我曾经幻想过那段感情
I was delusional about that relationship.

418
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,500
我告诉我的牙医说 他是我丈夫
I'd refer to him as my husband to my dental hygienist.

419
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,940
还有 不管如何 我的朋友们给我讲的那些
And anyway all of my friends used to tell me stories

420
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,740
关于这些白痴男人都会变好的故事
about how things might work out with these dipshits

421
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,720
因为她们朋友的朋友曾约会过这样的臭男人 和我类似
because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit like mine

422
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,860
结果这个朋友结婚了 过上幸福的生活
and that girl ended up getting married looking happily ever after.

423
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,080
但那都是例外 我们不是例外 我们只是普遍情况
But that's the exception. We're not the exception,we're the rule.

424
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,900
好了 我想想我是不是明白了
Okay,let me just see if I understand.

425
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,770
那么 你是说...
So what you're saying is

426
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,240
如果我听说一个女孩已经和一个男人在一起13年了
if I hear a story about a girl who's been with a guy for 13 years

427
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,930
最后他们结婚了 这就是例外
and he finally married her,that's the exception.

428
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,740
是的
Yes.

429
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,780
但是普遍情况是 像Neil这样的男人...
But the rule are guys like Neil

430
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,880
和我这样的女人
who are with girls like me

431
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,580
在一起7年了还没结婚
for seven years and aren't married

432
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,310
那就永远不会结婚了
they're never getting married.

433
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,160
- 不  - 不
- No.  - No.

434
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,850
- 不 不 不 不 不 不  - 不
- No,no,no. No,no,no.  - No.

435
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,900
- 她不是那个意思...  - 不 这和你没关系的
- It's not what she meant in that...  - No,it's got nothing to do with you.

436
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,190
我肯定不是在说你 我是说... 我是说...
I absolutely was not talking about you. I was... I was talking...

437
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,300
- 总是有特殊情况的  - 我是在讲我自己呢
- These are specific relationship situations. - I was talking about myself specifically.

438
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,070
专指我自己 知道么?
Just me specifically,you know?

439
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,170
那个男人让你不得不喜欢 知道吗?
This guy is,like,impossible not to like,you know?

440
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,610
他在便利超市和我很暧昧地打情骂俏
He's flirting with me pretty heavily outside of the Handy Mart

441
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,880
那个 一切都自然而然 真的很神奇
and,you know,everything just kind of lines up,it's really magical.

442
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,050
然后他告诉我他有老婆了
And then he tells me that he's married.

443
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,660
我肯定是要发火的 对不对?
Which,of course,I should be pissed about,right?

444
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,850
但我就是忘不了他
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

445
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,220
但他结婚了
But he's married.

446
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,830
我知道 我意识到了 我不知道我哪根筋搭错了
I know,I realize that. I don't know what's wrong with me.

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,260
我哪根筋搭错了?
What's wrong with me?

448
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,290
好吧
Okay.

449
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,240
我认识一个男人 他是我爸爸复印店里的员工
I know this guy,he works in my dad's printing business.

450
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,010
他跟一个好女人结婚15年了
And he was married for 15 years to a nice lady.

451
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,880
某晚他在教堂的活动上遇到了一个女人
And one night he meets this woman at some church event.

452
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,390
他告诉我爸爸说他从没有过那样的感觉
And he tells my dad that he's never felt anything like it before.

453
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,920
他觉得自己终于找到了灵魂伴侣
That he had finally met the one.

454
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,860
于是他和他妻子离婚...
So he divorced his wife...

455
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,290
... 之后他和这个女人一起过了22年...
... and he's been with this other woman for 22 years...

456
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,760
... 非常幸福
... and they're insanely happy.

457
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,530
我是说 如果你遇到了生命中的最爱...
I mean,what if you meet the love of your life...

458
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,800
... 但那个时候你已经嫁给了别人怎么办?
... but you already married someone else?

459
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,100
你就该无动于衷吗?
Are you supposed to let them pass you by?

460
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
你说得对 好
You're right. Okay.

461
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,710
我给他打电话
I'm gonna call him.

462
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,040
对
Okay.

463
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,890
- 喂?  - 嘿 Ben 我是Anna Marks
- Hello?  - Hey,Ben. This is Anna Marks.

464
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,470
嘿 Anna 怎么了?
Hey,Anna. What's up?

465
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,730
没什么 我只是... 想起来你说过能帮我
Nothing,I was just... I was taking you up on your offer.

466
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,350
你说你有些关系可能会对我有帮助
I know you said you had a couple of contacts you thought could help me.

467
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,780
我觉得我们可以边喝咖啡边聊一聊
And I thought maybe we could talk about it over coffee or something like that.

468
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,220
嗯 我...
Look,I just...

469
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,030
不行 Anna
I can't,Anna.

470
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,690
你很优秀 只是... 怎么说呢
You seemed great. I just... I don't know.

471
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,830
我得挂了
I should probably go.

472
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,700
不过 多保重 再见
Take care,though. Bye.

473
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,700
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey.  - Hey.

474
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,280
- 我就知道你会打给我  - 是吗
- I'm psyched you called.  - Cool.

475
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,880
我差点以为你不会回我电话了
Kind of given up on you when you didn't call me back.

476
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,710
我刚好想到你
I was just thinking about you.

477
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,680
- 来杯酒?  - 好
- Want a glass of wine?  - Sure.

478
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,680
对了 都有哪些类型来着?
Okay,what were the categories again?

479
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,690
四种类型:
Four categories:

480
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,420
聪明 性感 风趣和可爱
Smart,sexy,funny and cute.

481
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,760
但只能选两项
But you can only be two things.

482
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,260
比如Sarah Jessica Parker('欲望都市'女主演)属于风趣和性感
Like Sarah Jessica Parker would be funny and sexy.

483
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,400
比尔克林顿是聪明和性感
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

484
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,400
难以置信你居然认为Clinton是性感的
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

485
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,100
选吧 我是哪种?
Go. What am I?

486
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,430
等等 我是哪种来着?
Wait,what was I again?

487
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,440
你是聪明和可爱
You're smart and cute.

488
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,640
好吧 你是性感的 很性感
Okay,you are sexy,very sexy.

489
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,340
还有可爱的
And cute.

490
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,010
不 不对...
No,you can't...

491
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,310
性感和可爱都是外表那一栏的
Sexy and cute are both in the looks column.

492
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,250
谁也不想只具有同一栏的特质
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

493
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,380
尽管我这么说会显得很傻 但显然你四种类型都是
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,which obviously you are.

494
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,750
尤其是性感
Especially sexy.

495
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,760
你是最好的
You're the best.

496
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,490
我该走了
I better go.

497
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,860
好吧 呃 你想留的话可以留下
Okay,well,you know you could stay here if you want.

498
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,310
怎么了? 你有一阵子没来了
What? It's been a while.

499
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,210
不 不行
No,I can't.

500
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,810
我不能 我...
I can't stay,I'm totally...

501
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,570
我彻底 彻底醉了
I'm totally,totally fried.

502
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,940
你没关系吧?
Is that okay?

503
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,550
没事
Yeah.

504
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,680
回头见
I'll see you later.

505
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,290
再见
Bye.

506
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,230
嘿
Hey.

507
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
你看看正吗?
That look straight to you?

508
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,740
你挂那个干什么?
Why are you hanging that?

509
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,770
因为三周前你要我把它挂起来
Because you asked me to about three weeks ago.

510
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,140
我现在总算是有空了
I'm getting around to it.

511
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,340
怎么了? 你不喜欢吗?
Why? You don't want it here?

512
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,210
不 我喜欢 但别弄了
No,I love it there. But just stop.

513
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,850
为什么? 是画的原因吗?
Why? Is it the painting?

514
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,980
我也觉得这玩意看上去跟女人的平胸似的
You know,I know,it looks kind of like a deflated boob here.

515
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,460
对吧? 我知道
Right? I know.

516
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,100
真是压抑 要不我拿下来?
It's gonna be depressing. Should I take it down?

517
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,130
不是 我是不想你再对我好了
No,I want you to stop doing anything nice.

518
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,300
你在玩什么小把戏
This feels like a trick.

519
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,940
- 不是  - 不是?
- No.  - No?

520
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,100
不 我只... 我只是不想你再对我这么好...
No,I just... I just need you to stop being nice to me...

521
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,270
... 除非最终你会娶我
... unless you're gonna marry me after.

522
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,970
可笑吗?
Is that funny?

523
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,620
你觉得可笑吗?
Do you think that's funny?

524
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,150
不 我不是觉得好笑
No,I guess it's not funny.

525
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,260
呃 你不能总对我这么好...
See,you can't keep being nice to me...

526
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,120
... 我也不能再自欺欺人
... and I can't keep pretending that this is something that it's not.

527
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,590
我们在一起七年多了
We've been together for over seven years.

528
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,290
你了解我 你知道我是什么样的人
You know me,you know who I am.

529
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,300
你到底想不想娶我
You either wanna marry me or you don't.

530
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,170
不是我想不想娶你...
Or there's the possibility...

531
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,680
... 我是真的不相信婚姻...
... that I mean it when I say I don't believe in marriage...

532
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,310
扯淡
Bullshit.

533
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,510
扯淡
Bullshit.

534
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,020
听着 对女人来说这就是扯淡...
Come on,it's bullshit for every woman...

535
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,780
... 如果有个男人说他不相信婚姻...
... that has been told by some man that he doesn't believe in marriage...

536
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,420
... 但六个月以后他娶了一个在健身房认识的24岁女人
... and then six months later he's married to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

537
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,500
就是... 就是扯淡
It's just... It's bullshit.

538
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,130
你哪来的这些想法?
Where is this coming from?

539
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,320
五年来我一直都在逃避这种念头
From the place I've been hiding from you for about five years.

540
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,530
好了
Okay.

541
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,300
五年了 因为我不想让你觉得我要求太多
For five years,because I haven't wanted to seem demanding.

542
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,070
我也不想显得太依赖你或者精神错乱
And I haven't wanted to seem clingy or psycho.

543
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,370
或者别的什么
Or whatever.

544
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,670
所以我才没问过你
So I haven't asked you.

545
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,750
但现在...
But I...

546
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,650
我不得不问
I have to.

547
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,950
我是说...
I mean...

548
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,430
... 你到底会不会娶我?
... are you ever gonna marry me?

549
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,080
哦 我不能再这样了
Oh,I can't do this anymore.

550
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,680
... 如果他不想娶你

551
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,060
我以前还觉得我从没被甩过
I used to think that I had never been dumped.

552
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,230
对 然后我们相互研究了一下
Yeah,then we started comparing notes.

553
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,430
然后才发现其实每次都是我们被甩
Then we realized we've both been dumped by every man we've ever been with.

554
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,240
- 每次  - 对
- Every one.  - Yeah.

555
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,940
- 不过他们是如此狡猾  - 嗯哼
- But they do it so skillfully.  - Mm-hm.

556
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,450
狡猾到你会以为分手是自己的主意
They just so sneaky that you think it was your idea.

557
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,850
对 你往那儿一坐心里就嘀咕了:
Yeah. You're sitting back and you're like:

558
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,890
"哦 对 是我的主意 慢着 我怎么被甩了?"
"Oh,yeah. This my idea. But wait a second,why am I alone?"

559
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,550
"为什么我不快乐? 为什么我长了20磅?"
"Why am I unhappy? Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

560
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,130
- 他们控制了你的思想  - 对 他们是
- They Jedi mind-trick you.  - Yes,they do.

561
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,730
- 他们就这样过关了  - 对
- So they do a soft pass.  - Yeah.

562
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,960
他们总是说那几句话
They got little lines they like to tell you.

563
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,000
比如 "我不想妨碍你"
Like,"I don't wanna stand in your way."

564
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,570
或者 "你太好了 只是我还有待提高"
Or,"You're perfect,it's just I have to work on myself."

565
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,800
对 "我在为你的幸福着想"
Right. "I'm just thinking of your happiness."

566
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,570
"哦 我配不上你" 我最喜欢这句
"Oh,I don't deserve you." That's my favorite one.

567
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,140
你知道我还喜欢哪句吗?
You know the other one I like?

568
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,780
"我真嫉妒能娶你的那个人"
"I am so jealous of the guy who gets to marry you."

569
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,750
- 可笑 你自己怎么不娶我呢  - 对
- Well,that could have been you.  - Yeah.

570
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,610
我还觉得嫁给你更好呢
That's what I was leaning towards.

571
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,750
对 一旦你听到这些话...
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

572
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,910
... 你就直接跑去商店 大吃排骨和冰淇淋...
... run to the store,get yourself some ribs and some ice cream...

573
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,820
... 因为你被甩了
... because you have been dumped.

574
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,420
嘿 Anna 我是Ben
Hey Anna,it's Ben.

575
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,500
呃 我知道离你上次打电话来有一阵子了
Listen,I know it's been a while since you called.

576
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,760
只是... 我没有料到
It's just... It took me by surprise.

577
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,340
不过我确实说要帮助你的事业...
But I did offer to help you with your career...

578
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,600
... 没有什么不可以的 对吧?
... and I don't see why I can't do that,right?

579
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,370
不如你给我打个电话...
So why don't you give me a call...

580
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,070
... 或许你可以来我办公室什么的
... and maybe you can come by the office or something.

581
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,740
好吧? 就这样 保重 再见
Okay? All right,take care. Bye.

嘿 你
Hey,you.

哦 真是的
Oh,shit.

584
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,350

- You okay?  - Yeah.

586
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,350
一切还好
Everything's fine.

587
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,920
你又抽烟了?
Are you smoking again?

588
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,150
没有 亲爱的 我没抽烟
No,sweetie,I'm not smoking.

589
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,350
怎么了?
Why?

590
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,020
你一抽烟就神经质
You get jumpy when you smoke.

591
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,790
我没抽烟 我保证
I'm not smoking,I promise.

592
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,030
不是 我只是坐着...
No,I was just sitting here...

593
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,870
... 想象这间屋子装修完了的样子
... trying to picture what this room's gonna look like when it's finished.

594
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,300
- 挺有意思  - 是吗?
- I like that game.  - You do?

595
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,870
是
Yeah.

596
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,500
你想象的是什么颜色?
What color did you picture?

597
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,650
我正在为此踌躇
That's where I got stuck.

598
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,210
对
Yeah.

599
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,320
我想...
I was thinking...

600
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,620
... 也许用黄色
... maybe yellow.

601
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,190
- 黄色? 好  - 对 我觉得 黄色是中间色
- YeIIow? Okay.  - Yeah. I mean,it's neutral.

602
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,190
- 呃  - 对 可以当作任何房间
- Mm-hm.  - Yeah. So it could be whatever.

603
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,860
可以当作办公室 可以当做客房...
It could be an office,it could be a guest room...

604
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,730
... 健身房 婴儿房...
... a gym,a baby's room...

605
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,480
等等 你是说"中间" 还是"中性"?
Wait,did you mean "neutral," or "gender-neutral"?

606
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,210
- 不知道你在说什么  - 哦 真的?
- I don't know what you're talking about.  - Oh,really?

607
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,850
我知道我说过 我们可以以后再谈这个
I know we said we'd wait to talk about it.

608
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,750
- 呃  - 嗯
- Uh-huh.  - Mm-hm.

609
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:43,360
但我认为我们就快准备好了
But I think that we're almost ready to start talking about it.

610
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,300
所以那是我最后一次无偿服务
So that's the last time I do anything pro bono.

00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,080
... 我们怎么联系?
... how are we doing this?

622
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,240
是你等我的电话还是我等你的?
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?

623
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,440
什么?
What?

624
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,620
你说你会给我打电话...
You said you'd love to call me...

625
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,690
... 但你又说 "期待着你打电话来" 这...
... but then you said,"Look forward to hearing from you," and...

626
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,760
是不是有点不好理解?
You see how that's kind of confusing?

627
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,800
对 呃 我们再商量吧 我们会再联系的
Yeah,look,we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

628
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,290
你又来了 含糊其辞
You did it again. Very vague.

629
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,130
知道吗? 我们直接说你给我打电话...
You know what? Let's just say that you'll call me...

630
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,900
... 然后就可以省略其他的废话了
... and then we can skip all the nonsense.

631
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,940
再见 Gigi
Goodbye,Gigi.

632
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,680

639
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,260

My trampy little sister says MySpace is the new booty call.

657
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,430
我是说 时代不同了
I mean,things have changed.

658
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,940
人们不再那么愿意见面了
People don't meet each other organically anymore.

659
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,070
如果我想让自己在异性面前更有吸引力...
If I would like to make myseIf seem more attractive to the opposite sex...

... I don't go and get a new haircut,I update my profile.

661

That's just the way it is,you know?

662
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,950

00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,760
我想告诉你 这是有区别的
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.

681
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,730
确实有区别
There is a difference.

682
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,740
嘿 你是怎么说服Linda阿姨在两周内把这些礼服缝制好的?
Hey,how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?

683
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,140
她喜欢做这些
She wanted to do it.

684
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,680
真的吗? 她告诉我 她感觉这样就像裁缝铺里的印尼老太婆
Really? She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

685
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,610
- 不是这样吗?  - 不 她没有这么想
- Is that not right?  - No,she didn't.

686
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,870
不是?
No?

687
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,280
什么... ? 为什么急着结婚?
What's the... ? Why the big rush to get married?

688
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,790
因为我不想在冬天穿的那么臃肿去结婚...
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter...

689
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,820
...而且我还不想等到来年春天
...and I am not waiting till spring.

690
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,990
你真像怀孕了
You are so pregnant.

691
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,690
哦 天哪 我没怀孕
Oh,God,I'm not pregnant.

692
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,830
我没有怀孕 真是无聊
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

693
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,200
- 那来瓶啤酒吧  - 不 我不喝啤酒
- Chug a beer then.  - No,I'm not chugging a beer.

694
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,390
来一瓶吧
Chug a beer.

695
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,300
我们是相爱的 你们这群傻瓜
We're in love,you assholes.

696
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,030
结婚 是相爱的人都会做的事情
That's what people do when they're in love,they get married.

697
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,470
但是你知道吗? 并不是所有的人都会结婚 你懂吗?
But you know what? Not everybody gets married,you know?

698
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,140
有很多人永远都不会结婚
There are many people who never get married.

699
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,950
谢谢你这么积极的鼓励我
Well,thanks for the inspirational pep talk.

700
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,180
她其实想说 你和Neil分手没什么
What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.

701
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,380
对
Right.

702
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,320
很多人选择独身 而且他们过得很开心
Tons of people make the choice to be alone. They're happy.

703
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,930
比如阿尔·帕西诺（教父主角)
Look at Al Pacino.

704
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,360
从没结过婚 开心的不得了
Never been married,happy as a clam.

705
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,170
我是不是... ? 在这件事上要向阿尔·帕西诺学习?
Would that... ? Am I... ? Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

706
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,430
不是 Bethie 我们只是... 我们希望你能快乐
No,Bethie,we just... We want you to be happy.

707
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,900
那你就换掉这身珊瑚红的衣服
Well,then you should have rethought the coral.

708
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,980
哦 她那副表情
Oh,her face.

709
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,580
- 瞧你那表情  - 别把她弄哭了
- Your face.  - Don't make her cry.

710
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,740
我最讨厌这玩笑了
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

711
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,850
我知道 你很多愁善感 相信我 我了解
I know,you're sensitive. Trust me,I get it.

712
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,620
嘿 你干嘛不来跟我和Steven 还有孩子们吃晚饭呢...
Hey,why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids...

713
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,320
... 然后在我那儿过夜...?
... then you can just stay over...?

714
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,860
她干嘛要和你还有你老公呆在一起啊?
Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?

715
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,620
我最不愿意这么做
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

716
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,700
如果参加婚礼让你这么痛苦...
If being in this wedding is too painful...

717
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,500
哦 天啊 姐妹们 求你们了 别说了 放松 放松
Oh,God,you guys. Please,stop it. Relax,relax.

718
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,270
打住吧 好吗? 说真的 姐妹们 我是...
That's enough,okay? Seriously,you guys,I'm f...

719
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,600
我之前也分过手 如果你们还记得 我那时候处理的很好
I've gone through breakups before. If you remember,I handle them quite well.

720
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,110
你们亲眼见证过的 我有能力做好这些事情
You've been there,you've seen it. I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

721
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,870
这一次也不例外
I can do it again.

722
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,250
我不希望你们为我担心
I want you to stop worrying about me.

723
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,280
我很好
I'm fine.

724
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,280
我知道它肯定在这
I know it's here somewhere.

725
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,520
我和George Lane谈过关于音乐的事情 他有一堆的名单
I spoke with George Lane in Music. He had a whole list of references for you.

726
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,830
那好吧 等你找到了再给我打电话
Well,that's okay. You can just call me when you find it.

727
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,640
我发誓 我不是要找借口引你到这儿来
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.

728
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,540
我知道
I know.

729
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,070
但是 女孩子总可以幻想一下吧
A girl can dream,though.

730
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,140
你就是太好了
You're just too good a guy.

731
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,120
再问一次 你为什么结婚?
Why are you married again?

732
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,220
真的 为什么?
Seriously,why?

733
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,090
不 我真的觉得 知道了是件好事...
No,I really think that it would be good for me to know...

734
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,130
...为什么你没有这个女人就不能活
... why you cannot live without this other woman.

735
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,700
我们从大学的时候就在一起了 而且她给我下了最后通牒
Well,we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum.

736
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,470
她说 "如果我们不结婚 那就分手"
She said,"Either we get married or we break up."

737
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,010
所以我们就结婚了
So we got married.

738
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,150
哇 你屈服了
Wow. You caved.

739
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,510
这很复杂
It's complicated.

740
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,420
真的吗?
Really?

741
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,980
知道吗? 如果你和一个女孩恋爱很久却没有和她结婚 那你是个混蛋
What? You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.

742
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,660
而在没准备好的时候娶了她 那你就是个笨蛋
You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.

743
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,270
见鬼 我也不知道
I mean,shit,I don't know.

744
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,310
你真的很漂亮
You're really hot.

745
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,020
我显然迷上你了
And I am obviously attracted to you.

746
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,620
所以我想我最好是...
So I think the best I can do is...

747
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:32,360
... 等找到了那张单子 再打给你...
... eventually find this piece of paper and call you...

748
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,660
... 希望能为你的事业 尽一点绵薄之力
... and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.

749
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,700
嗨
Hi.

750
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,010
嗨 还好吗?

752
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,920
Javier 不是说好了要把家具罩上布吗
Javier,I thought we talked about tarping the furniture.

753
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,200
City Supper(餐厅名字)

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,880

Hold on.

756
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,840
- Alex?  - 嗨

757
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,950
- 好喝吗?  - 不错 再来一杯

758
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,110
- 你好?  - 嗨 我是Gigi
- Hello?  - Hi,this is Gigi.

759
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,120

- Gigi?  - Gigi Phillips.

760
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,910
- 嗯?  - 我 呃...
- Huh?  - I,um...

761
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,580
...有一支牙医的钢笔
...had the dentist pen.

762
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,920
是 嘿 你怎么样?
Right. Hey. How you doing?

763
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,890
- 我很抱歉麻烦你  - 没什么
- I'm really sorry to bug you.  - That's okay.

764
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,260
你的见解独到 我想问你个问题
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.

765
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,920
好的 听着 现在我必须说点难听的了
Okay,look,now I need to be harsh with you.

766
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,630
Conor永远不会对你有兴趣的 Geege
Conor's never gonna be interested in you,Geege.

767
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,830
嗯 我知道 这次是关于Jarrad的
No,I know. This is about Jarrad.

768
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,100

Jarrad.

769
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,180
我们在酒吧特价时间遇到的 他长得很帅...
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...

770
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,280
嘿 等我一下 好吗? 就一会 等一下
Hey,give me two seconds,okay? Two seconds,hold on.

771
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,580
让我猜猜 他说:
Let me guess. He said:

772
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,190
"最开心的就是遇到你"
"The only thing happy about this hour is you."

773
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,220
他或许比这更老套
He might have used some derivative of that.

774
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,060
他说他会打电话 但是之后他给了我名片 还说...
So he says he's going to call,but then he gives me his card and he says...

775
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,730
哦 他对你没兴趣
Oh,he's not interested.

776
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,710
- 我还没说他打没打  - 他打了吗?
- You don't even know if he's called.  - Oh,did he?

777
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,340
没有
No.

778
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,870
- 但是我真的认为他期待...  - 算了吧
- But I honestly think he's expect...  - Okay.

779
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,350
Gigi 他对你没有兴趣
Gigi,he is not interested.

780
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,950
Alex 这没什么大不了的
Alex,this is jacked.

781
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,890
女领班因为我没穿黑色衬衫 把我给骂了一顿
The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.

782
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,460
- 这不是黑色的  - 看看
- It's not black.  - Look at it.

783
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,600
不是黑色的衬衫 我看见了 不是黑的
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

784
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,430
这件衬衫是黑色的
This shit is black.

785
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,540
如果一个男人给你他的名片 却没要你的 说明他不喜欢你
If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours,he's not interested.

786
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,300
他先要了我的 然后他给...
He took mine first. Then he gave...

787
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,930
还有 如果一个男人想要约你 相信我 他一定会约你的
And also,if a guy wants to see you,believe me,he will see you.

788
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,920
我曾经给55个叫Lauren Bells的打了电话 直到找到我想找的那个
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.

789
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,780
那真是太可爱了
That's cute.

790
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,010
之后怎么样了?
What happened?

791
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,650
哦 她的屁股在白天看起来真大
Oh,yeah,as it turns out,her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

792
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,430
是不是因为你的细腻 你才这么受女人欢迎?
Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?

793
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,100
不要给他打电话 他不喜欢你
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

794
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,260
不要总是否定我的感觉
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

795
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,060
- 我只是想要帮你  - 我知道 谢谢你
- Well,I'm just trying to help.  - I know. Thank you.

796
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,670
不客气
Sure.

797
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,600
我要回去工作了 祝你好运
I gotta get back to work,but good luck.

798
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,570
好的 再见
Okay,bye.

799
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,210
嘿 哥们 在家吗?
Hey,buddy,you home?

800
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,610
在 进来吧
Yeah. Come on in.

801
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
嘿 想喝啤酒吗?
Hey,you want a beer?

802
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,520
还是苹果马爹利?
Or an apple martini?

803
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,030
哦 真好笑
Oh,that's funny.

804
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,730
你告诉你父母了吗?
Have you told your parents?

805
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,430
这是为了工作 我想扩大客户群
It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.

806
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,400
以假装成一个同性恋的方式?
By pretending to be gay?

807
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,270
应该说是 以对同性恋友好的方式
No,by being more gay-friendly.

808
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,500
或者 更准确点是 "同性相怜"
Or,in real estate terms,"gay-adjacent."

809
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,270
不错 我以后就这么说
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

810
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,880
我应该换了它 这或许是有点过头了
I should change this. It's maybe a little much.

811
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,610
我不知道 穿成那样 和一个不会跟你上床的女孩约会...
I don't know. Dressing like that,seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

812
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,250
... 我觉得你应该放弃
... I think you can pull it off.

813
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,610
不是她不会跟我上床 傻逼
It's not that she won't sleep with me,douche bag.

814
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,260
她跟我上过床 只是她 你知道的....
I have slept with her. It's just she,you know....

815
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,280
再也不会和你上床
won't sleep with you anymore.

816
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,690
差不多 是的
Pretty much,yeah.

817
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,820
你怎么看?
What do you think?

818
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,360
我觉得你有问题...
I think you got a problem...

819
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,590
... 因为你的美丽和性感 把她们都吓跑了
... because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick,you gorgeous,sexy man.

820
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,030
见鬼
Holy shit.

821
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,730
注意你的呼吸
Observe your breath.

822
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,310
吸气 鼓腹
Inhale,Belly rise.

823
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:20,610
呼气 收腹
And exhale,Belly fall.

824
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,610
双手合十 放于胸前
Bring your hands together in front of your chest.

825
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,950
心怀感激的低下头
Bow your head in gratitude.

826
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:35,030
- 合十礼  - 合十礼
- Namaste.  - Namaste.

827
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,290
谢谢你们来上课 下周再见
Thank you for coming. See you next week.

828
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,730
很好的课程
Great class.

829
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,650
我们偶遇了
We ran into each other.

830
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,980
你来上我的课
You came to my class.

831
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,480
我不知道是你上课
I had no idea this was your class.

832
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,490
你打电话问过是不是我上课的
You called to ask me if this was my class.

833
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,030
没有 你根本没有回我电话
No,you never called back.

834
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,130
因为你说 如果是我的课就不要回电话
Because you told me not to call you if it was my class. It was.

835
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,600
- 不 我们只是偶遇  - 好吧
- No. We just ran into each other.  - Okay.

836
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:17,400
我们只是单纯的朋友 碰巧在一起健身
We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.

837
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,540
确实是
Exactly.

838
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,870
你想游泳吗?
Do you want a swim?

839
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,070
当然
Sure.

840
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,520
你知道 我只是想...
You know,I was just thinking...

841
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,560
...为什么我们不能成为朋友?
... why can't we be friends?

842
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,350
我是说 我就不能再有朋友了吗?
I mean,am I not allowed to have friends anymore?

843
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,630
我是说 我不能跟那些性感的女孩做朋友吗?
I mean,am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?

844
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,500
我是说 这是什么偏见啊?
I mean,what kind of reverse prejudice is that?

845
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,870
我听着呢
I hear you.

846
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,530
我是说...
I mean...

847
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,110
... 我就不能和已婚男人做朋友吗?
... am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?

848
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,300
对
Right.

849
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,380
一个傻笑的?
Or has an insane smile?

850
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,910
有着令人浮想联翩的屁股的男人?
Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?

851
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,560
- 你刚才说"浮想联翩"?  - 是啊
- Did you just say "dry hump"?  - Yeah.

852
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,560
我想我恋爱了
Think I just fell in love.

853
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,930
所以我们是朋友了
So we're friends.

854
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,070
对
Yeah.

855
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,770
你想下来吗?
You wanna come in?

856
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,340
对不起 我不能信任我自己
I'm sorry,I don't trust myself.

857
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,780
没关系 你可以看
That's okay. You can just watch.

858
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,320
你或许是我有过的最好的朋友
You know,you may be the best friend I've ever had.

859
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,100
- 嗨  - 嘿
- Hi.  - Hey.

860
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,810
- 冲个凉 嘿  - 什么? 嗨
- Take a shower. Hey.  - What? Hi.

861
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,970
- 亲爱的?  - 嗯
- Honey?  - Yeah.

862
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,650
你闻起来怪怪的
You smell weird.

863
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,910
- 我闻起来怪怪的?  - 对 不一样
- I smell weird?  - Yeah,different.

864
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,320
- 怎么不一样?  - 我不知道
- Different how?  - I don't know.

865
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,580
似乎难以启齿
Sort of an odd thing to say.

866
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,060
可能是因为我在后院
You know,maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found.

867
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,170
找到的烟灰缸和香烟
In the back yard.

868
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,330
"我父亲死于肺癌"这句话...
What part of "My dad died of lung cancer"...

869
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,500
... 很难记吗?
... is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?

870
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,700
什么?
What?

871
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,370
不要骗我 Ben 求你 好吗?
Do not lie to me,Ben. Please,okay?

872
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,690
你是说真的吗?
Are you serious?

873
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,390
每天在这儿工作的工人那么多
We have,like,8000 undocumented workers here daily.

874
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,230
你发现了一个烟灰缸还有些烟蒂 所以你就认为...
Okay,and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think...

875
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,460
你就直接认为那些是我的
You automatically assume that they're mine.

876
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,200
哦 是的
Oh,yeah.

877
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,470
亲爱的 我没有骗你
Honey,I'm not lying to you.

878
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,210
我觉得...
I think...

879
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,210
...你真是神经过敏
... you are really freaking out.

880
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,380
因为没什么进展 整个装修工作让你压力很大
This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.

881
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,030
那就说不
Just say no.

882
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,420
然后扔掉它
Get it out.

883
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,760
洗个澡
Gonna take a shower.

884
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,660
- 我很累  - 好吧
- I'm exhausted.  - Okay.

885
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,470
- 抱歉  - 没事
- Sorry.  - It's all right.

886
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,520
谁会想到一个瑜伽课上认识的女孩...
Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga...

887
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,590
- ... 会给我介绍一个接吻高手?  - 继续 美女
- ... would fix me up with such a good kisser?  - Back at you,sister.

888
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,790
我都等不及再吻你了
I can't wait to kiss you again.

889
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,020
但是我们正在接吻啊
But we're kissing right now.

890
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,360
我知道 我是说下一次
I know,next time.

891
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,230
二次约会的吻会更有性趣
The second-date kiss is way more intimate.

892
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,400
听着
Well,listen.

893
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,060
我明天要走了 所以暂时不能联络了
I'm leaving tomorrow,so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

894
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,450
等我两秒钟好吗? 健怡可乐喝多了
Can you excuse me a quick second? Too many Diet Cokes.

895
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,080
好的
Okay.

896
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,690
喂?
Yeah?

897
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:16,630
嘿 不好意思又打扰你了 问你一个问题 很快
Hey,sorry to bug you again,quick question.

898
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,100
等一下好吗 宝贝 抱歉
Excuse me one minute,babe,sorry.

899
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,210
怎么了?
What's going on?

900
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,400
我和一个男的在亲热 限制级的
Okay,I'm making out with this guy,PG stuff.

901
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,020
他说他要去趟外地 会暂时不能联络
And he mentions that he's going out of town,he's gonna be out of touch.

902
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,310
继续
Run.

903
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,080
也许他真的要去外地
But maybe he is going out of town.

904
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,850
去哪儿? 他要去哪儿?
To where? Where's he going that he's gonna be out of touch?

905
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,390
你刚才说你要去哪儿?
Where are you going out of town to again?

906
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,830
嗯... 呃... 匹兹堡
Um... Uh... Pittsburgh.

907
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,530
匹兹堡
Pittsburgh.

908
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,830
离开他
Run.

909
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,440
现在 我应该离开所有不喜欢我的男孩?
So,what,now I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?

910
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,700
没错
Yeah.

911
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,200
那就没人了
There's not gonna be anybody left.

912
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,510
我不知道我为什么说这个
I don't know why I'm saying this.

913
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,510
但是我认识一个不错的男生 我想他会喜欢你的
But,I think I know a nice guy who might actually like you.

914
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,380
- 真的?  - 真的
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

915
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,650
他是我哥的朋友 他叫Bill
He's friends with my brother,his name's Bill.

916
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,350
我们都是喝酒的时候碰面 还不错
We'll all meet for drinks and It'll be good.

917
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,550
那么 我... 我现在在他家浴室里
So,I mean,I'm in his bathroom right now.

918
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,750
我该怎么办?
What do I do?

919
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:18,060
你总会出来的吧? 我不急 在这儿等你
Well,you gotta come out eventually,right? But I'd take my time in there.

920
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,300
让他急一急
I'd let him sweat.

921
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,730
- 谢谢  - 祝你好运
- Thanks.  - Good luck.

922
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,570
这船棒极了
Yeah,the boat looks great.

923
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,260
但你却糟糕透了
You look like shit.

924
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,340
但是你的船棒极了
But your boat looks great.

925
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,310
当然 我住在船上 伙计
Yeah,I live on my boat,man.

926
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,610
个人卫生要在窗外解决
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

927
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,050
大部分时间都在这里工作
A lot of time to work on the place.

928
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,220
你该试试在浴室里工作
You should try working on a shower.

929
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,810
是吧
Yeah.

930
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,180
嘿 我该怎么说呢?
Hey,what can I tell you?

931
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,290
- 坚守原则  - 完全明白
- Standing on principle,man.  - It's all I got.

932
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,920
来一根?
Cigarette?

933
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,290
不用了
No,I'm good.

934
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,800
很好 你戒了
That's right,you quit.

935
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,430
对你有好处
Good for you.

936
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:40,680
是Janine派你来监视我的?
So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?

937
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,110
没错 差不多
Yeah,pretty much.

938
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,150
你要怎么汇报?
What are you gonna tell her?

939
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,150
我要告诉她你在海上享受极了
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.

940
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,480
别开玩笑了
Break.

941
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,460
Beth怎么样了?
Any word from Beth?

942
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,400
她忙着她妹妹的葬礼 我想她一定...
You know,she's so busy organizing her sister's funeral,I think she must be...

943
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,660
妹妹的什么?
Sister's what?

944
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,830
她的婚礼 她妹妹的婚礼
Her wedding,her sister's wedding.

945
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,630
- 我刚说的不是婚礼?  - 不 你说的是"葬礼"
- Isn't that what I said?  - No,you said "funeral".

946
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,370
- 不 我没有  - 不 你有
- No,I didn't.  - Yes,you did.

947
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,170
我真的说了?
Shit,did I really?

948
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,540
太奇怪了
That's so weird.

949
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,210
我真不明白为什么有人想结婚?
I really don't understand why people wanna get married.

950
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,340
他们不想
They don't.

951
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
- 他们不想?  - 没错
- They don't?  - No.

952
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,580
事实上 没有男人想结婚
No,no guy actually wants to get married.

953
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,960
如果他们要结婚 他们真的考虑清楚了吗?
And if they do,all they're really thinking about?

954
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,320
他们会错过全天下的女人
All the women they're gonna miss out on.

955
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,690
我不想和别人一起 我只想和Beth一起
I don't wanna be with anybody else,I just wanna be Beth.

956
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,430
我不知道 我...
I don't know,man,I...

957
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,270
你为什么结婚?
Why'd you get married?

958
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,410
我爱Janine
I love Janine.

959
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,200
你是个快乐的已婚男人
You're a happyly married guy.

960
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,670
是的
Yeah.

961
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,870
没错 我想是的
Yeah,I'd say so.

962
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,550
现在 我想我没必要多此一举的告诉大家
Now,I know I don't need to tell any of you.

963
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,390
我的表妹Paige很辣
That my cousin Paige is hot.

964
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,500
上高中时 如果我告诉那些帅哥Paige是我的表妹
In high school,If I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin

965
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,730
他们会追着我的屁股后面跑
It'd keep me from getting my ass kicked.

966
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,630
因为没人想错失和她相处的机会
Because no one wanted to blow their chances with her.

967
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,870
当她站在那儿说要嫁给Devon时
And when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon.

968
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,740
世上不知又有多少颗心破碎了
There will be hearts breaking all over the world.

969
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,590
但是 不要忘了她的姐姐Beth还待价而沽呢
But,you know,keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market.

970
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,490
没错 也许她是位上了年纪的模特
Yeah,sure,she may be an older model.

971
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,390
但离掉价还有一段距离
But she got a lot of good miles left in that tank.

972
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,290
但是不要待的太久了
But don't stay on the lot too long

973
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,400
新的模特们会在出现 抢走所有风头...
or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all...

974
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,560
好了 发言到此为止
Okay,that's enough of the speeches.

975
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,760
好吧
Okay.

976
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,840
大家享用螃蟹吧
So enjoy the crab.

977
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:50,740
这个黄色的东西可不是芥末酱 它是螃蟹的胰腺
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

978
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,650

Beth.

979
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,890
你表弟Jay一直是个不分轻重的傻小子
Your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.

980
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,080
我知道
I know.

981
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,820
但就连他都结婚了
And somehow even he's married.

982
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,660
亲爱的 听我说
Oh,honey,look.

983
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,290
有一次 当大家只是要去某地露营时
Back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y.

984
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,460
你借去我的纽约时报
You borrowed my New York Times.

985
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,000
发现波克夏有一个艺术野营
Found some arts camp in the Berkshires.

986
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,340
你自己寄了封信给咨询处 拿到了入营证
Wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.

987
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,170
你总是独树一帜
You never did things like everyone else.

988
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,640
为什么呢?
Why not?

989
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,340
因为这就是你
Because that's you.

990
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,720
这就是为什么我最喜欢你这个女儿
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

991
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,790
你不该说这种话
You're not supposed to say that.

992
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,790
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

993
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,480
我退休了 我想说什么就说什么
I'm retired,I'll say what I want to.

994
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,650
如果你想 我会对整个屋子里的人这样说
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

995
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,590
等等 等等 等等! 过来 停下
Wait,wait,wait! Come here. Stop.

996
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,630
是实话
It's true,though.

997
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,970
嘿
Hey.

998
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,080
- 你在干嘛?  - 等你
- What are you doing?  - Waiting for you.

999
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,660
过来
Come on.

1000
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,060
不好意思 我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

1001
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,560
没事 没关系
No,it's okay.

1002
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,670
相亲前 我习惯早到
I like a little time before a blind date.

1003
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,530
打起精神 提醒自己不要泄露磨牙的事...
Prepare myself mentally,remind myself not to tell the story about my molars.

1004
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,940
Gigi 他不来了
Gigi,he's not coming.

1005
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,310
但是你可以告诉我你磨牙的事 我想听
But you can tell me the story about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1006
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,240
嘿
Hey.

1007
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,110
还没见面 就已经不喜欢我了?
How could he already not like me?

1008
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,510
是我搞砸了 我告诉Bill今天是星期四 是我的错
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1009
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,090
嗨 你还好吗?
Hi. Are you good?

1010
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,350
- 能给我杯加冰的詹姆士威士忌吗?  - 没问题
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?  - Sure.

1011
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,560
可怕 我要和一个分不清是星期几的人相亲
Awesome,I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1012
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,830
你看 那个女孩 她可能遇见了她的真命天子
Meanwhile,this girl,she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1013
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,470
- 就是那个女孩?  - 嗯
- This one right here?  - Mm hm.

1014
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,100
哦 天哪 不是
Oh,god,no.

1015
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,500
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1016
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,210
那个男的 装得像汤姆克鲁斯似的?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1017
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,710
她对他很有兴趣 但他完全没有
She's interested,he's clearly not.

1018
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,870
你不能匆匆一瞥 就说他没兴趣
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.

1019
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:07,710
事实上 我能 这种事我每晚都屡见不鲜
Actually,I can,I see this stuff going on every night.

1020
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,440
看着 她继续说着无趣的话题
Watch this,she's going on about her macrobiotic diet.

1021
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,880
而他在想 "上帝啊 让我脱身吧"
He's thinking,"Dear Christ,get me out of here".

1022
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,450
看 多么美妙的意外
And look at that,how fortuitous.

1023
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,290
酒洒出来了 真是完美 因为现在...
Drinks spill,which is perfect for him,because now...

1024
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,720
他可以去肩膀上有纹身的女孩那儿了
he can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.

1025
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,830
大哥 你太有才了
Man,you have a gift.

1026
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,090
现在 看看另一边的可怜虫
Now check out Droopy Dog on the other side.

1027
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,300
他会给她买单 但她坚信和他擦不出火花
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1028
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,600
也许不是 你需要一点火花
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1029
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,610
哦 火花这种事就是胡说八道
Oh,the spark thing is bullshit.

1030
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,370
- 真的?  - 胡说八道
- Really?  - Bullshit.

1031
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,880
教教我
Enlighten me.

1032
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,710
男人发明了火花这一说
Guys invented the spark.

1033
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,720
因为这样 他们就可以不打电话 可以对你很冷淡 让你捉摸不透
So they could not call and treat you kind of badly and keep you guessing

1034
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,620
然后哄你相信 你对此自然而然产生的焦虑和害怕
and then convince you that anxiety and fear that just develops naturally.

1035
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,380
是一种火花
It's actually just a spark.

1036
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,760
而你们这些女人照单全收 完全相信 还很喜欢
And you guys all buy it,you eat it up and you love it.

1037
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,130
你们喜欢是因为你们偶像剧看多了 就喜欢这种情节
You love it because you feed off that drama,you all love that drama.

1038
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,320
我不这样
I don't.

1039
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,830
那么你从来没有等到交稿或电话账单的最后期限?
So you never wait until the last minute on a deadline or a phone bill.

1040
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,900
你要知道自己是否能成功
Because secretly you cannot love the drama

1041
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,540
所以才喜欢这种情节
of not knowing whether or not you're gonna make it.

1042
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,840
也许是吧
Maybe.

1043
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,600
我猜猜看
And let me guess.

1044
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,010
那晚你和Conor见完面后
When you were stalking Conor the other night.

1045
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,340
你有没有一遍又一遍
Were you obsessing about him calling

1046
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,750
时刻关注他的来电 一连几天紧盯着电话
constantly pacing back and forth,staring at your phone for days.

1047
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,410
甚至会想 这次约会就这样了?
Even though the date was just kind of mediocre?

1048
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,430
好吧 没错
Okay,yeah.

1049
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,260
因为你期待电视剧里的情节 谢谢
Because you all thrive on the drama. Thank you.

1050
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:30,260
听着 你该学学我 如果一个女孩喜欢我 很好
Look,you gotta be more like me. If a girl likes me,great.

1051
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,630
但如果她不喜欢我 外面女孩还多的是 明白?
But if not,there are plenty more out there like her,you know?

1052
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,830
不要在一棵树上吊死
Probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.

1053
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,830
- 说的太好了  - 我知道
- Beautiful.  - I know.

1054
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,640
你为什么总是教我这些约会的技巧?
Why are you sharing all of this inside dating information with me again?

1055
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,640
不知道 我喜欢你
I don't know,I like you.

1056
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:46,970
真的?
You do?

1057
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,650
是 但别在本子里划满我的名字 好吗?
Well,yeah,okay,don't start doodling my name on your binder,okay?

1058
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,850
我只是... 我就像喜欢猎犬那样喜欢你
I just mean... I mean,I like you the way I like basset hounds.

1059
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,820
有时你可怜他们 想让他们振作起来
Something pathetic about them,you just wanna cheer them up.

1060
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,020
再说一说! 很实用
Again! With the sensitivity.

1061
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,220
敬实用
To sensitivity.

1062
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,110
看上去不错
It looks good.

1063
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,720
是的
Yeah.

1064
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:17,410
不错
Yeah.

1065
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,020
- 他手艺不错啊  - 的确
- He does good work.  - Yeah,he does.

1066
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,820
真不错
Very nice.

1067
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,530
真不错
Very nice.

1068
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,960
- Javier?  - 嗯
- Javier?  - Yeah.

1069
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,110

Javier.

1070
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,540
如果我问你一个问题
If I asked you an honest question.

1071
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,150
你会坦率的回答我吗?
Do you think you could give me an honest answer?

1072
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,280
- 当然会  - 很好 很好
- I think so.  - Good,good.

1073
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:52,720
我怀疑你的人在抽烟
Because I think some of your guys might be smoking.

1074
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,220

Javier?

1075
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,190
- 这是个问题?  - 是的
- Is that the question?  - Yes.

1076
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,920
- 听上去像是陈述  - 其中暗含疑问
- Seemed like a statement.  - The question part's implied.

1077
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,530
我听不出其中有疑问的语气
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1078
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,030

Javier.

1079
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,560
你的人到底
Have you guys been smoking

1080
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,500
有没有抽烟?
or not?

1081
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,900
不会的 夫人 他们不会在工作场所抽烟的 他们很守纪律
No,madam,my guys,they don't smoke on the job site,they're good guys.

1082
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,610
你确定你的人
Are you sure your guys haven't been

1083
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,110
从来没有躲起来
sneaking around here?

1084
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,340
抽烟?
And smoking?

1085
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,510
或者说谎?
And lying to me?

1086
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,950
对抽烟的事?
And smoking?

1087
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,180
我保证他们没有抽烟
I'm pretty sure.

1088
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,790
我需要你说实话 Javier
I need you to be honest with me,Javier.

1089
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,330
因为我不喜欢别人骗我
Because I can't have someone lying to me.

1090
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,930
当着我的面 站在我的房檐下 占用我的时间
To my face,under my roof,on my time.

1091
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:36,860
规矩还挺多
That's a lot of prepositions.

1092
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:41,700
我是说 其实没必要说谎 对吗?
I mean,there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty,is there?

1093
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:45,200
我们双方有承诺
I mean,we made promises to each other.

1094
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,540
我们签了合同
I mean,we have a contract.

1095
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,700
这就是一份承诺 不是吗?
That's like making promises,isn't it?

1096
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,650
也许我该回去开工了
Maybe I should get back to work.

1097
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,110
是的 没错
Oh,yeah,right,yeah.

1098
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,660
很好
That's great,yeah.

1099
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,490
- Javier?  - 嗯
- Javier?  - Yeah.

1100
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,950
我们没事吧 对吗? 你和我
We're good,right? You and me.

1101
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,130
- 是 是的 没事  - 很好
- Oh,yeah,yeah,we're good.  - Oh,good.

1102
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,140
很好
Okay,that's great.

1103
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,330
他工作做的很好
Yeah,he did great work.

1104
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,140
嘿
Hey.

1105
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,280
欢迎大家 感谢大家的到来 我是Conor
Welcome,everybody,thanks for coming,I'm Conor.

1106
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,980
有空请来签个名 请大家把这儿当成自己的家
Sign in when you get a second,make yourselves at home.

1107
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,350
我们准备了一些糕点 冰饮 请自便
We got some cookies over here,some cold beverages,help yourself.

1108
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,080
Conor 你真是房地产界的Liza Minnelli
Conor,you are the Liza Minnelli of real estate.

1109
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,030
- 你朋友Mary真是个天才 - 我知道 她很棒
- I know,your friend Mary's a genius.  - I know,she's so great.

1110
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,660
我得走了 我想 要说再见了
Well,I gotta go,so I guess I'll see you later.

1111
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,170
什么 你还有课?
What,you got a class,or?

1112
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:49,700
是的 不 就是有点事
Yeah. No. No,just something.

1113
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,310
- 要做  - 好吧...
- Stuff I gotta do.  - Okay. Well...

1114
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,440
- 再见  - 好吧
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.  - Okay.

1115
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,880
好了 再见
Okay. Bye.

1116
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,950
- 再见  - 好 给我打电话
- See you later.  - All right. Call me.

1117
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,340
怎么了?
What?

1118
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,150
她有事瞒着你 对吧?
She's holding out on you,isn't she?

1119
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:12,960
不知道你在说什么
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1120
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,220
很明显她不会和你上床
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1121
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,790
一切都写在你可怜的脸上
It's written all over your puppy dog face.

1122
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,340
- 我很难过 我快死了  - 来块饼干吧
- It's killing me,literally. I'm dying.  - Here,have a cookie.

1123
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,940
不用 我很冷静
No,I'm cool.

1124
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,770
我不知道她在做什么 读不懂她
I don't know what she's doing. I cannot read her signals.

1125
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,810
我们以前一直睡在一起
We used to sleep together all the time.

1126
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,880
骗你们的 不知道我为什么那么说
That's not true. I don't know why I said that.

1127
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,540
虽然不是一直 但我们的确睡过 不完全是编的
It wasn't all the time,but it happened. I know I'm not just making this up.

1128
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,550
接着莫名其妙就结束了 但她还会给我打电话
And then out of nowhere it just stops. But she still calls.

1129
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,920
她想让我帮她按摩 她就给我留言
She wants a massage. She leaves cute messages.

1130
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,590
但没有其它发展 她在干嘛?
But it's not going anywhere. What is she doing?

1131
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,700
实话说 我俩也看不出来
Honestly,we may not have the best insight.

1132
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,840
同性恋之间的暗示和异性恋不一样
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.

1133
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,770
对 完全不一样
He's right. The signals are totally different.

1134
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,670
比如暗示 "我想和你上床"
Like,here. Here's "I wanna sleep with you."

1135
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,270
一 二 三
One,two,three.

1136
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,780
就这样 三秒钟左右 就成了
That's it,three seconds or more,it's on.

1137
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,580
再如暗示 "我不想和你上床"
And here's "I don't wanna sleep with you."

1138
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,280
一 二...
One,two...

1139
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,120
- 不 我不玩 走开  - 就这么简单
- Nope,thanks for playing,move along.  - It's that simple.

1140
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,390
对 这些帮不了我
You're right,that didn't help me at all.

1141
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,430
嗯 不过 我可以告诉你:
All right,well,I can tell you this:

1142
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,590
不管同性恋还是异性恋 不主动就完蛋
Gay or straight,you're not gonna get anywhere by being inactive.

1143
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,060
她喜欢你 也许她希望你拿出男子气 采取行动
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.

1144
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,300
给我拿块葡萄干饼 好吗?
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,will you?

1145
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,870
- 谢谢  - 给
- Thanks.  - Here you go.

1146
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,870
如果她不和你上床

1147
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,250
如果女孩喜欢你 就会和你上床
If a girl's into you,she's sleeping with you.

1148
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,880
如果一个月后 至多两个月后...
If after a month,or two months at the very outside...

1149
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,110
... 她不和你上床?
... she's not sleeping with you?

1150
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,620
她就不喜欢你
She doesn't like you.

1151
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:49,890
办法是尽早看懂一个女孩
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1152
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:54,000
不要浪费一到七周的时间 却一无所获
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1153
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,000
所以我总结了助于读懂女孩的迹象
So I've come up with some signs about how to spot this girl.

1154
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,500
以下迹象说明她不会和你上床
A girl will never sleep with you...

1155
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:04,730
她叫你"小可爱"或"可靠男"
...if she calls you "cuddly" or "dependable."

1156
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,070
她在你面前挤痘痘...
If she pops a zit in front of you...

1157
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:10,770
... 她说她名叫Amber或Christine...
... if her name is Amber or Christine...

1158
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,150
... 她在你浴室上大号...
... if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

1159
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,910
...她把约会没吃完的打包回家 一次 两次 或三次
... or she takes home leftovers on dates one,two,or three.

1160
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,550
我知道这不科学...
I know it's not scientific...

1161
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,990
...但我还是要说 悠着点儿
...but I'm just saying,you were warned.

1162
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,200
等等 停一下
Wait,stop.

1163
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,510
怎么了?
What?

1164
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,950
见鬼
Shit.

1165
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,780
怎么了?
What?

1166
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,820
我深深被你吸引了
I am so into you.

1167
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,850
说实话 我从未有过这感觉
Seriously,I've never felt like this before.

1168
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,690
我必须让自己停止想你
I have to actively stop my brain from thinking about you.

1169
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,360
一直在努力
Like,all the time.

1170
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:12,310
为什么要停止?
Why stop?

1171
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,470
因为我不做这样的事
Because I don't do stuff like this.

1172
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,510
什么事?
Stuff like what?

1173
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,320
和妻子以外的女人们上床
Like sleep with women that aren't my wife.

1174
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:27,890
首先 我不是女人们 是一个女人
First of all,I am not "women," I'm just one.

1175
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,920
其次呢?
And second of all?

1176
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,220
没有其次
Oh,I didn't have a second of all.

1177
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,190
我还期待这"其次"会让我好受些
I was hoping "second of all" would make me feel better.

1178
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,860
其次...
Second of all...

1179
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,900
... 我也无法停止想你
... I can't stop thinking about you either.

1180
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:02,750
他为了我离开他妻子 真疯狂
He's totally leaving his wife for me. That's crazy.

1181
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:05,020
太疯狂了 我们彼此还不太了解
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

1182
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,250
我不懂 看看Becca
I don't know. I mean,look at Becca.

1183
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,060
我妹妹的朋友
You know,my sister's friend.

1184
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,960
在餐厅遇见一个服务生...
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

1185
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:14,430
... 一顿饭后 他俩就知道彼此找到了真爱
... and by the end of the meal,they both knew they had found the one.

1186
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:19,070
对 你是对的 这些有可能发生 对吧?
You're right. You're totally right. I mean,it could happen,right?

1187
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,410
不会发生在我身上
Not for me.

1188
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,280
那个爱发短信的家伙呢?
What about texter?

1189
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:26,140
和他都是文字接触
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

1190
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,280
这家伙可能做过手术 切掉了喉...
I mean,this guy could've had surgery,leaving him without a voice box...

1191
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,920
... 用气孔呼吸...
... breathing through a stoma...

1192
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:35,550
... 我不清楚 因为我还没听过他的声音
... and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice.

1193
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,660
我怀疑他气孔都没有
Well,I doubt he has a stoma.

1194
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,890
重点是 我讨厌发短信
That's not the point. I can't text.

1195
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,230
你知道 短信展现不出我的魅力
You know,I'm not charming via text.

1196
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,030
那你就别再发短信了
Maybe you should just stop texting.

1197
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:50,160
我不仅讨厌短信 还讨厌电子邮件 语音留言 慢邮
But it's not just texting,it's e-mail. It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

1198
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,430
都是正常的通讯方式
That's regular mail.

1199
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:53,340
总之 这些都没用
Whatever. None of it's working.

1200
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:58,500
曾有个家伙在我公司电话上留言 我回家打给他
I had this guy leave me a voicemail at work,so I called him at home.

1201
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,120
接着他给我发了手机邮件 所以我又回了短信
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,and so I texted to his cell.

1202
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:08,220
接着他往我家里发电子邮件 一切都失控了
Then he e-mailed me to my home account and the whole thing just got out of control.

1203
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:13,660
我好怀念只有一个电话号码 一部电话应答机的日子
And I miss the days where you had one phone number and one answering machine.

1204
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,590
电话应答机只能放一盒录音带...
And that one answering machine housed one cassette tape...

1205
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,430
... 录音带里要么有 要么没有男人的口信
... and that one cassette tape either had a message from the guy or it didn't.

1206
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,800
而现在必须查看所有的通讯方式...
And now you have to go around checking all these different portals...

1207
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,030
... 还常常操作不成功
... just to get rejected by seven different technologies.

1208
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,040
太累了
It's exhausting.

1209
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:31,670
那个上MySpace的家伙呢?
What about that MySpace guy?

1210
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,410
- Jude 我喜欢他  - 好啊
- Jude. I like him.  - Good.

1211
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,490
我感觉我们心有灵犀
Yeah,I felt like we connected.

1212
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:38,950
不错啊
Great.

1213
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,990
万一她要你吻她呢?
What if she wants you to kiss her?

1214
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,860
那我就不得不吻她
Well,then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her.

1215
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,790
"Amanda Jones可不嫩...
"Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...

1216
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,990
... 不会被你业余级的吻弄得不能自已"
...who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips."

1217
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:54,370
她可是久经情场
This babe has plenty of battle scars.

1218
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,860
你好?
Hello?

1219
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,540
嗨 你在家啊
Oh,hey,you're home.

1220
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,040
不然我该在哪儿?
Where am I supposed to be?

1221
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,140
出去玩? 今天周末
Out,maybe? It's Saturday night.

1222
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,040
你不让我和不喜欢我的男孩出去 结果就没人了
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

1223
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,480
听着 我只是想给你留个话
Right. Listen,I was just gonna leave a message.

1224
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:13,140
我下周末要办个聚会 你会来吧
I'm having a party next weekend. You should come.

1225
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:17,830
不知道 Conor会去吗? 会有点尴尬
Oh,I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kind of awkward.

1226
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,930
他在华盛顿开会 到时会有很多单身男人哦
He's at a real estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.

1227
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,660
那就会碰到更多让我尴尬的人了
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.

1228
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:27,330
别担心 有我呢 我会帮你的
Don't worry,I'll be there. I'll talk you through it.

1229
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:29,760
好了 我挂了
Okay,gotta go.

1230
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,000
好像有一堆盘子摔破了 到时候见吧
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates. Maybe I'll see you there.

1231
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,610
你真忙 我不该打给你的 不 是你打给我的
You're busy. I shouldn't have called. You called me.

1232
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,840
- 是的  - 再见
- Yup,good.  - Bye.

1233
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,410
怎么...? 怎么做?
How...? How do you work on it?

1234
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:47,680
把我当成女孩 好吗?
Pretend I'm a girl,okay?

1235
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,380
我是说...
I mean...

1236
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:52,090
... 把我当成那个
... pretend I'm her.

1237
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,660

Amanda.

1238
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,160
他喜欢上我了
He's into me.

1239
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,500
太棒了 我就知道
Awesome. I knew it.

1240
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,610
- 这次是谁?  - Alex
- Who's this now?  - Alex.

1241
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:07,040
我彻底明白了 他是Watts
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

1242
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,370
- 他是什么?  - 电影妙不可言的女主角
- He's what?  - From Some Kind of Wonderful.

1243
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,570
Watts是女演员Mary扮演的
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.

1244
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,980
- 对  - 为什么你不是Watts?
- Yes.  - So why aren't you Watts?

1245
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,140
我是男主角Eric Stoltz
I'm Eric Stoltz.

1246
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,790
Alex是Watts 因为Watts搓合了男主角和女孩Amanda
Alex is Watts. Because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.

1247
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,820
其实她爱着男主角
Really,she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

1248
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,660
所以Amanda是Conor?
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

1249
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:31,400
也许 总之这不是重点
I guess. At first. Now men in general,but that's not the point.

1250
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,430
重点是他喜欢上我了
The point is he's into me.

1251
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,060
我就知道他花时间陪你 肯定有原因
I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.

1252
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,800
对 很明显 有许多迹象
I know. It's so obvious now. There are so many signs.

1253
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,440
迹象 爱的迹象 快告诉我 我喜欢听
Signs. Love signs. You gotta tell me about the signs. I love signs.

1254
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:48,550
开始不明显 我第一次打给他 他说"很高兴你打来"
First they were small. At first when I called,he said,"Good to hear from you."

1255
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,150
- 非常好的迹象  - 是吗?
- Totally good sign.  - Right?

1256
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,950
第二次打去 他正和一个女人...
And then the next time I called he was with a woman...

1257
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,820
... 但他接了电话 我们聊了一阵
... but he took the call and we talked for a while.

1258
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,050
- 你怎么知道是女人  - 他叫她"宝贝"
- You know it was a woman?  - Called her "babe."

1259
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:02,160
男人不会晾着眼前的女人 去接另一个女人的电话 除非...
Okay,a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's...

1260
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,660
这就很明显了
And it gets more obvious.

1261
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,830
他介绍给我的男人 并无其人
I mean,please. There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with.

1262
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,470
其实就是他自己
The fix up was him.

1263
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,770
不会吧
No.

1264
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,880
会 他出现的时候 这个Bill的虚构人物并没来
Yes. He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.

1265
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,770
倒是我和他来了场约会
The two of us basically have a date.

1266
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,880
接着他打电话邀我参加在他家的聚会
And then he calls and invites me to a party at his place.

1267
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,450
他果然喜欢你
He so likes you.

1268
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:28,180
真为你感到高兴
I'm so happy for you.

1269
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,290
我们来为你的婚礼挑个地方
Let's look up places for your destination wedding.

1270
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,390
喜欢纳帕谷吗?
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

1271
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,730
我一直想去那儿
I have really always wanted to go there.

1272
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,470
噢 他很可爱
Oh,he's cute.

1273
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,070
闷骚又敏感
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

1274
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,180
"我只有一把吉它 和弦 和真心"
Oh. "All I have is my guitar,these chords,and the truth."

1275
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,540

Bon Jovi.

1276
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,120
- 不错  - 我喜欢他
- That's hot.  - Yeah. I like him.

1277
01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:00,350
可能他没给我打电话 是因为昨晚我们才喝了咖啡
I mean,he probably hasn't called yet because we just had coffee last night.

1278
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,690
- 是吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah,you know.

1279
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:06,090
我们视频聊天时 手上正拿着咖啡
I mean,we actually video iChatted while holding coffee.

1280
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,920
一回事 不是吗?
But that's the same thing,right?

1281
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,220
- 对 对  - 查查你的电话留言
- Right,right.  - Just call your voicemail.

1282
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,270
昨晚他有个演奏会 可能很晚才回家
Yeah,but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late.

1283
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,410
- 我告诉你们他是个歌手了吗?  - 嗯
- Did I tell you he's a singer?  - Mm... hm.

1284
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:18,340
- 查一查  - 不 用免提
- Just call.  - Oh,honey,no,on speaker.

1285
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,240
别这样 肯定没有留言
I don't think so. I'm sure he hasn't called.

1286
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,930
- 查一查  - 好吧
- Just call him.  - Okay.

1287
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,140
- 您有两条新留言  - 嗯
- You have two new messages.  - Oh.

1288
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,960

Mary

1289
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:39,990
噢 Mary Mary Mary Mary
Whoa,Mary,Mary,Mary,Mary

1290
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:43,500
噢 我的Mary
Oh,my Mary

1291
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,700
我刚才太刻薄了
I just got hard.

1292
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,360
嗨 Mary 我是Jude
Hey,Mary,it's Jude.

1301
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:15,950
噢 见鬼 这不是刚打过的号吗?
Whoa,shit. What number did I just dial?

留言已清空
All messages erased.

1303
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:31,640
那个
That one.

1304
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,910
- 确定?  - 嗯
- You sure?  - Yeah.

1305
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,510
错 这是压制板
No. It's a laminate.

1306
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,950
- 不是硬木板?  - 嗯
- That's not real hardwood floor?  - Nope.

1307
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,610
看起来很像 不过价钱只有硬木的百分之一
It looks exactly like it. But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.

1308
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:44,990
噢
Oh.

1309
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,330
我还是想要实木的
I still wanna go with the real wood.

1310
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,430
啊? 你连区别都看不出来
What? You can't even tell the difference.

1311
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,330
那不重要
It's not the point.

1312
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,700
那重要的是什么?
Well,what is the point?

1313
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,570
我...
I just...

1314
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,740
我不喜欢它伪装实木
I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.

1315
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,500
如果不是实木 就别装得像
If you're not wood,don't try and look like wood.

1316
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,340
我不认为这是伪装
I don't think that it's pretending.

1317
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:09,210
这是造假 Ben
This is a lie,Ben.

1318
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:13,010
应该站出来 做真正的自己
Just be up front and tell people what you really are.

1319
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,950
好 你是对的
Okay,you're right. You're right.

1322
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,160
好的
Okay.

1323

我和别人上床了
I slept with someone.

1324
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,380
- 我说...  - 我听见了
- I said...  - I heard you.

1325
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,960
你在这里告诉我是因为 你知道我不喜欢公开吵闹
You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.

1326
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,820
不 不是这个原因
No,that is not why I'm telling...

1327
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,920

1330
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,870
烟也是你抽的 对吗?
It is you that's been smoking too,isn't it?

1331
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,940
啊...? 跟有抽烟有什么关系?
Wha...? Wait,what does that even matter?

1332
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,810
你是不是...?!
Have you... ?!

1333
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,710

He said I could stay at his boat for a while.

1337
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,230
你说什么?
Excuse me?

1338
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,460

Now you're moving out?

1339

- 你想要离开我?  - 不
- You're,like,leaving me?  - No.

1340
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,900
不 我只是以为你不想让我…
No,I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to...

1341
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,640
我们不解决这个问题吗?
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

1342
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,770
你不想找些方法...
Don't you wanna find some way...

1343
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:47,580
来解决这个问题?
for us to work through this?

1344
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,990
我以为我告诉你这些 你就会让我...
I assumed that when I told you,you would want me...

说真的 Devon 我觉得你刚才在宣誓的时候 有那么一瞬间的犹豫
Seriously,Devon,I really did feel just a moment,a splash,of hesitation.

不 不是的 我一点都没犹豫
No,there wasn't. There wasn't any hesitation at all.

- 哇哦  - 来看看史前巨石柱

01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:32,340
他们没有机器来移动这些石头 它们太巨大了
They didn't have the machinery to move those rocks. They're huge.

不认识 我们的朋友Mary从Conor那知道的
We don't. Our friend Mary heard about this from some guy named Conor.

1386
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,060
你是怎么认识Alex?
And how do you know Alex?

1387
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,560

1388
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,390
我很肯定我们之间会发生点什么
I'm pretty sure that something's about to happen between us.

1389
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:33,100

So are you here as,like,a guest,or,like,his date?

1391
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:40,910
我讨厌这样 不知道自己是不是在约会
Oh,I hate that. When you don't know if you're a date.

1392
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,350
你不知道自己是否应该带朋友来 或者像他一样去招待大家...
You don't know if you should bring a friend,or are you co-hosting...

1393
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,210
或者是不是应该等到最后 好有些独处时间?
or should you stay to the end to have some alone time?

1394
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,860
他没说 不过我想可能不仅仅是个客人
He didn't say. I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

1395
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,550
- 我是说 有很多迹象表明了这一点  - 真棒
- I mean,there have been signs.  - Cool.

1396

七年 但是也是一段很长的时间
Seven. But still,it's a long time.

1401
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,660
是呀
Yeah.

1402
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,130
表亲不能结婚真是太糟了 不然我们就有可能…
It's too bad cousins can't marry,because then we could maybe...

1403
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,270
哦 Dominic
Oh,Dominic.

1404
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,660

01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,210
- Ken 你还好吗?  - 他一直抓着自己的胸口
- Ken,are you all right?  - Just clutched his chest.

1408
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,350
他站在那里 然后突然就…
He was standing there and all of a sudden...

1409
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,550

You guys,did anybody see what happened?

1416

1417
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,130

1420
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,900
要不要帮你参谋下他们对你的感兴趣程度?
You need me to evaluate any level of interest?

1421
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,340
他们是同性恋 应该对我没什么兴趣
They were gay. Even I know their level of interest was probably low.

1422
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,540
嗨 Skilo!

Listen,I gotta go make a liquor run,but the food needs some refreshing.

1427
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,660
- 能不能请你帮忙装...?  - 帮着招待?

01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,170
当Alex说他想办个聚会 我说"那就做吧!"
You know,when Alex said he wanted to throw a party,I was like,"Let's do it!"

1437
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,140
- 谢谢你们的邀请   - 别客气了 随时欢迎
- Thanks for having us.  - No problem,any time.

1438
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,380
要我帮你找东西吗?
Can I help you find something?

1439
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,610
哦 不用 没关系的 我找到了
Oh,no,it's okay. I got it.

1440
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,220
谢谢你帮忙搅拌
Thanks for mixing that up.

1441
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,110
什么?
What?

1442
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,950
Alex让我把调料搅拌在一起 谢谢你帮忙
Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started.

1443
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:41,990
应该多用一点茴香
It could use a little more dill.

1444
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,890
不过我能搞定 别担心
I'm on it,though,don't worry.

1445
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,800
来吧 孩子 把球传到篮下
Come on,my boy. Take it home.

1446
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,800
干得好 我的Marbury
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

1447
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,600
- 15秒  - 走吧
- Fifteen seconds.  - Let's go.

1448
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,070
- 哦 通过了  - 你玩得挺认真啊
- Oh,a pass.  - You work too hard.

1449
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,580
我想我已经把剩下的啤酒瓶都集中起来了
Well,I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.

1450
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:04,010
- 哦 你们在玩什么?  - 抱歉 Nash
- Oh,what game are we playing?  - Oh,sorry,Nash.

1451
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,410
- 来吧  - 来吧 来吧
- Oh,come on.  - Come on,come on.

1452
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,220
- Nash 你真是个蠢货 来吧  - 或许我应该...
- Nash,you piece of shit. Come on.  - Maybe I should just...

1453
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,120
- 现在已经3点多了 所以...  – 好 就这样
- It's past 3,so...  - Okay,swat it.

1454
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,730
看这个 准备好了吗?
Watch this. Ready?

1455
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,450
- 然后...  – 哦 不 不 不!
- And...  - Oh,no,no,no!

1456
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:18,830
好 干得好 太棒了
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

1457
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,930
你真是... 你真是太厉害了
Oh,you are... You're sensational.

1458
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,160
- 是的 我知道  - 老天
- Yeah,I know.  - Jesus.

1459
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,430
真不知道我为什么要跟你较量
I don't know why I bother.

1460
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,570
- 你刚才说现在已经3点多了?  - 是的
- Did you say it's past 3?  - Yeah.

1461
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:30,040
- 哦 朋友 我该走了 嘿 玩得很开心  - 好的
- Oh,man,I gotta go. Hey,good game.  - All right.

1462
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,240
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

1463
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,330
谢谢你留在这里帮我清理
Hey,thanks for staying and helping me clean up.

1464
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:01,470
但我真想赶紧上床睡觉去
I really gotta go to bed,though.

1465
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,130
这是个邀请吗?
Is that an invitation?

1466
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,040
什么?
What?

1467
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,610
哦 老天 这招太俗了
Oh,God,that was cheesy.

1468
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:11,540
哦 我不太擅长这些
Oh,I'm not good at this.

1469
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,110
什么?
What?

1470
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,420
嗨
Hey.

1471
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,030
哦 是的 我知道的
Oh,yes. I knew it.

1472
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,260
最好的恋情是发展自友谊的
The best relationships grow out of friendships.

1473
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,500
等等 等等 Gigi
Wait,wait,wait. Gigi.

1474
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:34,330
等等 等等
Wait,wait,wait.

1475
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,810
什么?
What?

1476
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,810
现在你跟我在谈恋爱?
Now you and I are in a relationship?

1477
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:41,880
恩 我想说 即使我们不是在谈恋爱...
Well,I'd say if we're not at relationship station-ship...

1478
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:43,520
至少我们已经朝这方面发展了
we're at least on the track.

1479
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,910
为什么你会这么想?
And why exactly would you think that?

1480
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,850
因为这些信号
Because of the signs.

1481
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,790
是吗 比如什么?
Really,like what?

1482
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,190
比如 你说接到我的来电很高兴...
Like,it was good to hear from me...

1483
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,730
当你跟其他女孩在一起时还跟我聊天...
and you talked to me even when you were with a girl...

1484
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,600
我能感觉到
and I felt something.

1485
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,070
哦 天
Oh,man.

1486
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,500
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1487
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:08,970
Gigi 不记得我都跟你说过些什么吗?
Gigi,what have I been saying since I met you?

1488
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,810
如果男人想约你 他会主动 对不? 他会约你出去
If a guy wants to date you,he will make it happen,okay? He will ask you out.

1489
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,170
我约你了吗?
Did I ask you out?

1490
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,540
没有
No.

1491
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,240
你为什么这么做?
Why would you do this?

1492
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,520
哦 真该死
Oh,shit.

1493
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:24,380
为什么女人会这样? 这样想当然...
Why do women do this? Build up this stuff in their minds...

1494
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,430
把男人做的一点点小事曲解成别的东西?
take each little thing a guy does,and then twist it into something else?

1495
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,290
简直不可理喻
It's insane.

1496
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,730
我宁愿那样 也不想像你一样
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

1497
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,070
你说什么?
Excuse me?

1498
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,220
那是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

1499
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,280
我可能是很喜欢仔细琢磨每件小事...
I may dissect each little thing...

1500
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,510
翻来覆去地想 ...
and put myself out there too much...

1501
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:00,020
但至少代表我还在乎
but at least that means I still care.

1502
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:06,060
哦 你以为不在乎女人就是赢了?
Oh,you think you've won because women are expendable to you?

1503
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:10,570
这样你也许不会伤害到你自己或者让自己出丑...
You may not get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way...

1504
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,430
但同时你也不会尝到爱情的滋味
But you don't fall in love that way either.

1505
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:15,340
你没有赢
You have not won.

1506
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,670
你还是一个人 Alex
You're alone,Alex.

1507
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,780
我可能做了该死的蠢事...
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

1508
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:31,450
但我知道我会比你更快找到另一半
but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.

1509
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,630
还要别的吗?
Do you want anything else?

1510
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,260
当然 少一些硬纸板 多些人吃的东西
Yeah,less of the cardboard crap and more regular people food.

1511
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,030
嗯 那个硬纸板是我们常说的全麦吐司
Well,that cardboard crap is what we call whole-wheat toast.

1512
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,940
或许你能给我煎一些香肠
Well,maybe you could just fry me up a couple of sausage links.

1513
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,240
对于刚刚突发心脏病的人来说...
People who have just had a heart attack are generally not advised...

1514
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,880
最好不要吃这种富含动物脂肪的东西
to have animal fat that's been stuffed into a synthetic casing.

1515
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,260
嗨 Beth 去厨房的时候给我拿瓶啤酒 好吗?
Hey,Beth. Grab me a beer when you get to the kitchen,okay?

1516
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,270
再来一点冷盘 如果还有剩的话
And a little plate of cold cuts,if there are any left.

1517
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,970
你们这些家伙能不能把声音关小点? 爸爸要睡了
Hey,would you guys please just turn that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

1518
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,130
你觉得他会舍不得这些黑胶碟吗?
You think he wants to hang on to this vinyl?

1519
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:26,340
我很希望它们加入我的藏品行列
My collection could use a lot of these.

1520
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,850
该死 能不能关掉?
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

1521
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,610
我们的卫生纸用完了...
Well,we're totally out of toilet paper...

1522
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:39,420
能吃的也只有果冻和一些面
and all we have left to eat is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

1523
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:44,260
爸爸都还没死呢 我们的新兄弟就想分财产了
And our new brother would like to co-opt Dad's property before he's even dead.

1524
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:47,560
Laura你的老公还想再要瓶啤酒...
Laura,also your husband would really like another beer...

1525
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,860
他已经连续玩那个在线高尔夫5个小时了
to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf network.

1526
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,430
你好吗?
Are you okay?

1527
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:58,610
不要担心 亲爱的 爸爸会没事的
Don't worry,honey,Dad's gonna be fine.

1528
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:01,870
- 你知道她是谁吗?  - 不
- Do you know who it is?  - No.

1529
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,050
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

1530
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,890
你要离开他吗?
So are you gonna leave him?

1531
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,020
Gigi 他是我老公
Gigi,he's my husband.

1532
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:15,360
他不是那些不给你回电话的男人
He's not some guy who didn't call me back.

1533
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,460
他跟我坦白了
He did admit it to me.

1534
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:21,320
他没有等到被抓到才说 这是需要勇气的 你知道吗?
He didn't wait to get caught,which takes courage,you know?

1535
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:24,640
抱歉 我不是那个意思
I'm sorry,I didn't mean that.

1536
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,070
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

1537
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,670
我知道Alex不是那种人
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

1538
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,030
哦 没关系
Oh,it's okay.

1539
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,410
要知道 这是我的错
It's my fault,you know.

1540
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,980
什么?
What?

1541
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:44,420
哦 我只是想我对这个烂摊子应该...
Oh,I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole...

1542
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:47,150
应该负些责任的 你知道吗?
mess. You know?

1543
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,090
是我逼他结婚的
I forced him into getting married.

1544
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,690
- 他还没准备好  - Janine 这不是你的错
- You know,he wasn't ready.  - Janine,this isn't your fault.

1545
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:56,890
不 是这样的 我变了
No,it is. It is. I've changed.

1546
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,430
我曾经...
I was...

1547
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,600
很风趣 你知道吗?
fun,you know?

1548
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,810
当我们第一次见面时我很风趣
I was fun when we first met.

1549
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,100
你现在也很风趣啊
You're still fun.

1550
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,290
我们不做爱了
We don't have sex anymore.

1551
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:23,860
很多夫妇都会有冷淡下来的时候
Lots of couples go through lulls.

1552
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,520
不 我是说...
No,I mean...

1553
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:30,840
我们从来没有做爱
we never have sex.

1554
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,770
实际上 我是说 我能怪他吗?
I mean,realistically,what do I expect him to do,you know?

1555
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:44,250
我觉得这真的太...
I don't think that's really...

1556
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,650
上帝啊 这瓷砖太小了
God,this tile is too small.

1557
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,760
我得告诉Javier
I have to tell Javier.

1558
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,390
- 什么?  - 这种瓷砖太小了
- What?  - This tile is too small.

1559
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:58,530
我得走了 别人问的话就说我今天有点私事儿
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,

1560
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,390
...如果他跟别人上床了
if anyone asks.

1561
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,140
我第一个老公没什么特别的
my first husband was  unimpressive


1562
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:13,110
他跟他的波霸秘书被我捉奸在床
I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary...

1563
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,470
当我提前从马尔代夫回到家的时候...
when I came home early from the Maldives.

1564
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:18,550
太没创意了
It was just so unoriginal.

1565
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,080
我都替他丢脸
Made me feel sorry for him.

1566
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,920
我的第二任丈夫就挺有想象力的
My second husband was a pinch more creative.

1567
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:26,890
背着我跟我妹妹有一腿...
Cheated on me with my sister...

1568
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:32,120
让我觉得自己疑心太重 不正常
but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.

1569
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,760
所以搞外遇至少得动点儿脑筋 耍些手段
So at least some mind games,some intrigue.

1570
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,560
可我的最后一任丈夫 真是个极品
But my last husband,he was a gem.

1571
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:42,640
他是个名副其实的遮谎专家
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.

1572
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:47,750
我翻查他的通话记录 截获他的信用卡账单...
I mean,I pored over his phone records,I intercepted his credit-card bills...

1573
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,010
还在很多场合都跟踪过他...
I had him followed on numerous occasions...

1574
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:53,520
却从未发现过一丁点儿证据
and never found a single shred of evidence.

1575
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:56,090
直到他去世后...
It wasn't until he died...

1576
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:01,460
我才发现他跟他澳洲情妇的一处房产

1682

我想也许这都是我的错...
I think maybe this is my fault...

1692
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,730
因为我可能没有说清楚我想要的

所以让我... 让我说清楚

1703
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,630
难道是一群同志把你逼到这份儿上了?
A bunch of gay people put you up to this?

1704

He's still got it.

1707
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,150
- 真烂  - 怎么会这样? 真丢人

You have to be kidding me.

1715
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:33,960
我刚做了一点儿 就很快就做完

All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

1803
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:53,070
这套房子花了你不少钱吧?
You're getting a lot of bids on this place?

1804
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,470
是啊 我知道这很疯狂 但正好附近有人转手
Yeah. I know it's crazy,but it's a neighborhood in transition.

是啊 就是那样的
Yeah. Hip gay people,young couples,young families.

1807
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,920
天哪 这地方使我想起了我的老家
God,this reminds me of where I grew up.

1808
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,590
我敢打赌这儿有...
I bet it's got one of the...

1809
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,620

Wait a minute.

1810
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,360

我们以前也有个一模一样的...
We used to have the exact same one...

1813
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:30,440
只是我老妈把这当桌子
except my mom used it as a desk.

1814
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:34,480
那么...
So...

1815
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:37,710
你请的那些家伙什么时候到呢?

01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:40,040
好吧 事实上 房子明天才开放
Well,actually,the open house is tomorrow.

1817

但有一位买家...
But I have this one buyer...

1818
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:46,220
首先我希望他的女朋友能喜欢它
and I wanted to make sure his girlfriend likes it first.

1819
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:49,120
哦 他有女朋友 哈?
Oh,he has a girlfriend,huh?

1820
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,630

Yeah,I have an idea.

1821
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,030
关于这个房子的
For this house.

01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,330
还有我
For me.

1823
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,270
我希望 如果你喜欢的话...
And hopefully,if you like it...

1824
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,030
我们能继续发展的话 你知道的...
and things continue to,you know...

1825
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,040

Anna...

1826
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:06,270
我有个计划 你知道吗?
I have a plan,okay?

1827
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:09,410
我知道我要走的路 而我想让你陪我走
I know where my life is going,and I want you to go with me.

1828
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,850
我不是在说让你马上就搬进来...
I'm not saying I want you to move in right now...

1829
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:15,950
但我不会买这个地方 除非...
but I don't want to buy this place unless,at some point...

1830
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,390
你有搬进来的可能性
you could see yourself moving in.

1831
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,650
那么 你怎么想的呢?
So,what do you think?

1832
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:24,490
我做不到
I can't do this.

1833
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:27,090
好吧
Okay.

1834
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:31,170
好吧 如果这样太快了 我猜我们总可以...
Well,if it's too fast,I guess we can always just...

1835
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,570
我不能答应你任何事
I can't do any of this.

1836
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:35,600
我意思是...
I mean...

1837
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:40,210
你所说的 还有你所提供的...
what you're saying and what you're offering...

1838
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:43,440
是每个女孩子梦寐以求的
is what every girl wants.

1839
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:45,950
也是我一直想要的
It's what I always wanted.

1840
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,110
只是...
It's just...

1841
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,160
我不是你想要的
You don't want it with me.

1842
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,040
好吧
Okay.

1843
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,380
我有个问题
I have a question.

1844
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:25,090
有没有什么办法 我们可以...
Is there any way we could...

1845
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:29,050
回到过去 当我们只是睡一起的时候...
dial it back to before,when we were just sleeping together...

1846
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:33,290
因为 我也说不清 我的脑子已经是一团浆糊了
because I don't know,I felt like that gelled.

1847
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,770
宝贝?
Babe?

1848
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:24,680

晚安
Good night.

1852
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:57,610
你忘了什么吗?
You forget something?

1853
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:00,570
是的
Yeah.

1854
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:03,620
真的吗? 你忘记什么了?
Really? What did you forget?

1855
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:08,790
这个
This.

1856
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:18,090
你半夜跑过来 就是为了把一只促销笔还给我吗?
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?

1857
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:19,360
没错
Yeah.

1858
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:24,870
我只是觉得应该找点像样的借口来见你
I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.

1859
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,140
一般不都是这样吗?
That's how it's done,isn't it?

1860
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,910
有时候
Sometimes.

1861
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,640
听着 我忍不住一直想你
Look,I can't stop thinking about you.

1862
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,310
这是个问题
It's a problem.

1863
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:38,720
我开车到你家 给你电话然后挂掉
I drive by your place,I call and hang up.

1864
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:39,910
我好像变成了...
I'm turning into...

1865
01:53:40,090 --> 01:53:41,580
我
Me.

1866
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:44,190
是的
Yeah.

1867
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,630
一个聪明人曾告诉过我...
A wise person once told me...

1868
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:54,600
如果一个男人喜欢一个女人 不管怎样 他都会把她追到手
that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen,no matter what.

1869
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,870
没错
That's true.

1870
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:59,070
但当我对你投怀送抱时...
But when I was hurling my body onto yours...

1871
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,370
你却不想和我在一起
you did not seem to want to make it happen.

1872
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:04,880
是的 好吧 事情是这样的:
Yeah,all right. Here's the thing about that:

1873
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:06,480
你是对的
You were right.

1874
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:10,350
我已经习惯了 跟所有的女人保持安全距离...
I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women...

1875
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:11,890
所以渐渐地...
and having the power...

1876
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,180
我已经不知道...
that I didn't know what it felt like...

1877
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:16,550
爱一个人...
when I actually fell...

1878
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:18,890
是什么感觉了
for one of them.

1879
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:23,900
我当时不知道
I didn't know.

1880
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:35,310
听着 我刚和你的朋友Bill约会了...
Look,I just went out with your friend Bill and...

1881
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,540
是的
Yeah.

1882
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:39,280
也许他正是我所想要的
He might be just exactly what I need.

1883
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:41,180
平平淡淡
No drama.

1884
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:43,650
他给我电话 他没有食言
He calls,he does what he says.

1885
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:45,950
- 我也能做到啊  - 但你没有
- I can do that stuff too.  - But you didn't.

1886
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:48,650
那个聪明人还告诉我 我要做自己的主人
And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.

1887
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:52,420
我不能指望男人会改变自己
That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.

1888
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,860
我不应该再想着...
That I have to stop thinking that...

1889
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,950
我是个特例
I'm the exception.

1890
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:19,620
你是我的特例
You are my exception.

1891
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:03,990

Conor Barry.

1892
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:06,600
嗨 我是Blade公司的Mary
Hi,it's Mary at the Blade.

1893
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:09,070
我在看你的新广告 我很喜欢它
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

1894
01:56:10,010 --> 01:56:12,570
真的吗? 你不觉得T形的肌肉太夸张了吗?
Really? You don't think the muscle T is too much?

1895
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:17,010
我觉得你现在穿的衬衫可能更配你
I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.

1896
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,250
什么 你在这儿?
What,you here?

1897
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,610
我就坐在你前面
I'm sitting right in front of you.

1898
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,860
哇 这就是你啊 Mary
Wow,this is you. Mary.

1899
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:27,080
是我
It's me.

1900
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:28,490
我是我
I'm me.

1901
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:33,700
我能...?
Should I...?

1902
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,300
- 来吧 来吧  - 好的
- Please. Please.  - Okay.

1903
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:37,490
- 一会再聊  - 待会见
- Talk to you in a minute.  - See you in a second.

1904
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:39,530
好的
Okay.

1905
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:42,870
嗨
Hey.

1906
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,340
- 你好  - 你好吗?
- Hi.  - How are you?

1907
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:45,910
很高兴终于见到你了
It's nice to finally meet you.

1908
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,140
- 我也是  - 这次是真人
- You too.  - In person.

1909
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:49,910
这是个愉快的惊喜
This is a pleasant surprise.

1910
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,310
- 你...  - 什么?
- You...  - What?

1911
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,610
- 我不知道 不是我预料中的  - 我的声音和我的脸不匹配吗?
- I don't know. Not what I expected.  - My voice doesn't match my face?

1912
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:57,150
你的声音没能很好地衬出你漂亮的脸蛋
Your voice does not match your face in a good way.

1913
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:00,350
而是... 是的 我意思是... 那听起来不好
In a... Yeah,I mean... that sounded terrible.

1914
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,730
太神奇了
Amazing.

1915
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,230
我不知道这些东西之前是怎么放的
I don't know how all this stuff fit in here before.

1916
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:12,300
我知道 这里似乎变宽敞了
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

1917
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:25,580
你不应该把这个带回来
You are not trying to get these back in here.

1918
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:28,690
- 你不会把这些裤子扔掉吧  - 我们有协议的 先生
- You are not getting rid of these pants. - We had a deal,mister.

1919
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:30,220
我和它只能留一个
I don't either not staying.

1920
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:34,720
- 你可以把它们叠起来放好啊  - 连慈善机构都不会想要这条裤子
- You know what,you can store those horizontally.  - Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

1921
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:37,360
他们可以被熨平的 你可以...
They could be pressed,flattened,you can...

1922
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:40,990
如果你要把它们扔出去 至少检查一下口袋 好吗?
If you're gonna throw them out,at least check the pockets,all right?

1923
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:44,800
那你就不会扔掉一些私人物品了
So you don't throw away some personal items.

1924
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:05,280
我太爱你了
I love you so much.

1925
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:07,620
太爱太爱了
So much.

1926
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:10,420
我要你幸福
And I wanna make you happy.

1927
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,000
我一定要让你幸福...
I need to make you happy...

1928
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:17,430
只要你幸福 我死都愿意
for me to even have a shot at being happy.

1929
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:23,940
你 愿意 嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

1930
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:33,140
愿意 当然愿意
Yes,of course I will. Yes.

1931
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,880
是的
Yes.

1932
01:58:39,490 --> 01:58:41,290
感谢主
Thank God.

1933
01:58:45,230 --> 01:58:47,460
女孩在成长的过程中会学到很多东西:
Girls are taught a lot of stiff growing up:

1934
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:50,190
如果一个男孩欺负你 是因为他喜欢你
If a guy pinches you,he likes you.

1935
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:52,600
不要打理你的前刘海
Never try to trim your own bangs.

1936
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:57,730
然后有一天 你会遇到非常棒的男人 从此过着幸福生活
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending.

1937
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:59,570
你们互相宣誓
And your commitment to each other.

1938
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:04,480
我们看的每场电影 听过的每个故事...
Every movie we see,every story we're told...

1939
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:06,340
都告诉我们要耐心等待
implores is to wait for it.

1940
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:12,990
而第三类情况是:无法预知的爱情宣言
The third act twist: The inexpected declaration of love.

1941
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,090
游离于规则之外
The exception to the rule.

1942
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,820
但有时我们太专注于寻找幸福...
But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending...

1943
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,690
而没有学会如何读懂别人的暗示
we don't learn how to read the signs.

1944
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:25,800
如何分辨谁是真正爱我们的人
How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.

1945
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:29,270
如何分辨这个人是不是只是生命中的过客
The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.

1946
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:39,710
你好
Hi

1947
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:44,620
或许这个幸福的结局中并没有一个很棒的男人
And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.

1948
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,950
或许是你...
Maybe it's you...

1949
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,400
你一个人...
on your own...

1950
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,620
收拾好心情 然后重新开始
picking up the pieces and starting over.

1951
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:00,930
释放自己 为了更好的未来
Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.

1952
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:05,640
或许这个幸福的结局只是...
Maybe the happy ending is just...

1953
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:08,150
继续生活
moving on.

1954
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:15,390
Baby 你在做什么啊? 轮到我们了 别在搅这个了 来吧 来吧
Baby,what are you doing? It's our turn. Forget the dip. Come on,come on.

1955
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:17,610
我们开始吧 Alex
Let's go,Alex.

1956
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:19,380
快点 Alex 轮到你们了
Come on,Alex,your turn.

1957
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,820
准备好了吗? LOL
Ready? LOL.

1958
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:23,360
Laugh out loud! 我们赢了!
Laugh out loud! We won!

1959
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:25,390
或者可能幸福的结局是这个:
Or maybe the happy ending is this:

1960
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,430
我们明白 即使你曾因男人不回电话而伤心欲绝...
Knowing that through all the inreturned phone calls and broken hearts...

1961
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:33,090
即使你曾像没头苍蝇一样四处碰壁 
through all the blinders and misread signals...

1962
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:36,240
即使你曾经受伤或者出糗...
through all of the pain and embarrassment...

1963
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:40,280
你也决不能放弃希望
you never,ever gave up hope.

1964
02:00:40,290 --> 02:00:47,500


1965
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,080
既然我们结婚了...
Now that we are married...

1966
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:50,520
我们得搬家
We're gonna move.

1967
02:00:50,690 --> 02:00:52,660
是啊 那是我们要做的其中一件事
Gonna move. That's one thing we're gonna do.

1968
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:56,820
另一件该做的事是 搬的远一点...
Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from...

1969
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,760
- 离巴尔第摩远点?  - 是你的姐妹们
- Baltimore?  - Your sisters.

1970
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,330
我是说 人人都会犯错
I mean,everyone makes mistakes.

1971
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:07,490
我试着弄明白我想做什么 我想成为什么样的人 你明白吗?
I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do,who I wanna be,you know?

1972
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:11,300
也许开始的晚了点 但为什么不呢? 为什么不呢?
Probably seems the wrong time to do that,but why not? You know,why not?

1973
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,810
迟做总比不做好
Better later than never.

1974
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:14,670
现在我又约会了
I'm dating now.

1975
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:19,580
你最怀念婚姻的什么呢?
What do you miss most about marriage?

1976
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,220
你结婚了吗?
Have you been married?

1977
02:01:21,390 --> 02:01:22,440
是的 我结婚了
Yes,I'm married.

1978
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:24,250
- 你结婚了吗?  - 我结婚了
- You are married?  - I am married.

1979
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:26,250
那你的问题是?
And what's your question?

1980
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:30,260
- 我们有进展 公平吗?  - 进展很快 很顺利
- We're heading there,is that fair?  - It's moving fast. Just on our way.

1981
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:33,190
我喜欢他 我会说那个L开头的字
I like him,I'll say that L word.

1982
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,330
没错 的确是以L开头 是的
That's true,it does start with an L. Yeah.

1983
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,900
我非常喜欢她 因此...
I like her a lot,so...

1984
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:41,630

- Good,I'm glad.  - I love her. I love her.

1985
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,810
我把精力集中在...
You know,what I've been focusing my energy on...

1986
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:48,810
比如说自我发现 不去约会
is like a self-discovery,as opposed to dating.

1987
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:51,410
我不知道 或许我现在还不适合约会
I don't know. Maybe dating's a little overrated.

1988
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:56,350
我准备和好朋友一起去印度玩几个月
Good friend of mine and I are going to India for a few months.

1989
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:57,920
我们要去瑜伽静修
We're going on a yoga retreat.

1990
02:01:58,090 --> 02:02:00,350
我真的是发自内心地爱她...
I really genuinely love this person...

1991

他邀请我和她一起办这个聚会...
He had asked me to co-host this party...

1992
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:03,790
我从旁协助
and I stayed after.

1993
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:07,630
我想帮你解围 因为有个女人一直粘着你...
I was trying to help you out because there was this girl who would not leave...

1994
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:10,560
- 那个高个女人  - 没错 她很风骚
- that tall girl.  - Right. She was gross.

1995
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,100
我试着...
I was trying to...

1996
02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:14,100
她... 拜托
She was... Come on.
