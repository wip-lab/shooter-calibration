14
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:46,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just  account. I don't know anything.</font>

15
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,322
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to know anything</font>

16
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,215
<font color=#FFFF00>Except the combination to the safe</font>

17
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,396
<font color=#FFFF00>You do know the combination, yes?</font>

18
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,409

<font color=#FFFF00>Hello my friend, it's Malankov</font>

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,507
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to your office to collect my money</font>

23
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,805
<font color=#FFFF00>What a disappointment to see it's not here.</font>

24
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:55,118
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm leaving you something here in return.</font>

25
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:57,443
<font color=#FFFF00>as a reminder</font>

26
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:02,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I can not wait any longer</font>

27
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,787
<font color=#FFFF00>My best to the family</font>

28
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,365

<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:46,837
<font color=#FFFF00>How old?</font>

31
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,485
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how old they are, my friend.
They will always be our baby</font>

32
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:53,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Ain't that true?</font>

33
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on big guy.</font>

34
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:56,915
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you!</font>

00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:16,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow!</font>

36
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,601
<font color=#FFFF00>Happy birthday!
Dad.</font>

37
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,415
<font color=#FFFF00>My birthday is not even for 3 days.</font>

38
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Your always saying I'm so predictable.
I wanted to shake</font>

39
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,399
<font color=#FFFF00>things up a bit and make it
a little less predictable.</font>

40
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,126
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, come in</font>

41
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:34,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Champagne glasses</font>

42
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,434
<font color=#FFFF00>You know me.
Why would I have Champagne glasses?</font>

43
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:42,403
<font color=#FFFF00>Or a giant stuff panda.
I heard that.</font>

44
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:44,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Inappropriate, huh.</font>

45
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I mean...</font>

46
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Not if I was 7.</font>

47
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,034
<font color=#FFFF00>Well I can I can return
it or you can hang on to it</font>

48
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,781
<font color=#FFFF00>until you have a
7 year old of your own</font>

49
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,626
<font color=#FFFF00>Not funny.</font>

50
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey baby! Babe!
Yay!</font>

51
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:56,935
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, look who's here.</font>

52
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:58,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Mills</font>

53
00:05:58,913 --> 00:05:59,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello Timmy</font>

54
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,945
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?
Good, you?</font>

55
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,033
<font color=#FFFF00>You know.
Hey! Hi.</font>

56
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,881
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, if you guys are having father
daughter moment I can really...</font>

57
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:14,318
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no, no,
I just dropped by thought I'd do something.</font>

58
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Unpredictable. Kim is always
pointing out how predictable I am.</font>

59
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,816
<font color=#FFFF00>That's funny coming from her.
You wanna talk about predictable.</font>

60
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:22,495
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not predictable.
Come on!</font>

61
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,915
<font color=#FFFF00>Every single day she goes
to the same exact store,</font>

62
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:27,227
<font color=#FFFF00>right off campus, every morning before class</font>

63
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:30,380
<font color=#FFFF00>gets the same peach yogurt drink, right?
The 4th one from the back,</font>

64
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,753
<font color=#FFFF00>not the 5th one,
not the 3rd one, right? Stop.</font>

65
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,009
<font color=#FFFF00>Cause it's still cold.</font>

66
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,205
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I would do exactly the same thing</font>

67
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:38,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, the OCD gene</font>

68
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:39,707
<font color=#FFFF00>So, whats with the bubbly?</font>

69
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Pre-birthday celebration
-Nice</font>

70
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:46,687
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't mind, I think it's just
a little early to pop open a bottle.</font>

71
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. Yeah, no problem.
I'll put it in the fridge.</font>

72
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,684
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?</font>

73
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:00,092
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I'll leave you two</font>

74
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad font...</font>

75
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,702
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to take it. Now I feel bad.</font>

76
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, you should feel bad. I'll exchange</font>

77
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,365
<font color=#FFFF00>it for something more predictable.</font>

78
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Love you. Take it easy, Jimmy.
-Alright!</font>

79
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:17,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, how you doing?
Is something wrong?</font>

80
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,176
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing
-You sure, babe?</font>

81
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:41,527
<font color=#FFFF00>How'd it go?</font>

82
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Great, fantastic.
It couldn't have gone better</font>

83
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,486
<font color=#FFFF00>The panda was not a hit, i take it.</font>

84
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,439
<font color=#FFFF00>Careful what you say.
He's sitting right next to me</font>

85
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,985
<font color=#FFFF00>When did she grow up, Lenore?</font>

86
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,601
<font color=#FFFF00>I know</font>

87
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,521
<font color=#FFFF00>It goes so fast. All of it</font>

88
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:57,947
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?</font>

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,581
<font color=#FFFF00>just going home. Make a little dinner</font>

92
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take a rain check on that.
If thats OK with you?</font>

93
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:12,254
<font color=#FFFF00>And the panda</font>

94
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,977
<font color=#FFFF00>That's fine by us</font>

00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,532
<font color=#FFFF00>I know what your thinking</font>

98
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:23,617
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep it to yourself</font>

99
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:42,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey
-Lenny</font>

100
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You changed your mind
-Yeah</font>

101
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,891
<font color=#FFFF00>You left the door open.
-Come on in</font>

102
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,697
<font color=#FFFF00>OK</font>

103
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not intruding or anything.</font>

104
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,565
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course your not,
I was just preparing dinner, drink?</font>

105
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,913
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, please.</font>

106
00:08:57,757 --> 00:08:58,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for coming over</font>

107
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,401
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheers
-Cheers</font>

108
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,629
<font color=#FFFF00>You look stressed.
-Yeah. Why?</font>

109
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart and I...</font>

110
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,835
<font color=#FFFF00>we've tried everything.
Therapy, counseling, together, separately</font>

111
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,768
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants it to work. He really does.</font>

112
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,911
<font color=#FFFF00>And you?
-I know I'm hurting him</font>

113
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,457
<font color=#FFFF00>I just don't feeling anything anymore.</font>

114
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,103
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate that. I hate not feeling.
I hate going through the motions.</font>

115
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,257
<font color=#FFFF00>They only thing I feel is trapped.</font>

116
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I have the worst taste in men.
-Thanks</font>

117
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,556
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my God!</font>

118
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,115
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't talking about you.
Oh God, I'm sorry.</font>

119
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:40,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Its OK.</font>

120
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what I fantasize about?</font>

121
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,235
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid to ask</font>

122
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:50,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Us</font>

123
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,392
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah?</font>

124
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:59,984
<font color=#FFFF00>Right after the guilt comes roaring in,
I feel like such a shit</font>

125
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that make me a bad
person? Being married</font>

126
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,358
<font color=#FFFF00>to one man, fantasizing about another?</font>

127
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:09,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Confused, maybe. Bad, no</font>

128
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:13,285
<font color=#FFFF00>You must think I'm crazy</font>

129
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:16,911
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are Lenny, you're not the only one</font>

130
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:29,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenny</font>

131
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:31,909
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.
-No</font>

132
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:37,934
<font color=#FFFF00>This lead that you are apologizing.
It's not that I don't want to, believe me</font>

133
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,860
<font color=#FFFF00>But until you and Stuart
clear up your situation,</font>

134
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:43,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it would do more harm than good</font>

135
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:44,887
<font color=#FFFF00>For all of us</font>

136
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you have to be so damn honorable</font>

137
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Believe me, right now I wish I weren't</font>

138
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna go.
-Wait!</font>

139
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:56,636
<font color=#FFFF00>Here</font>

140
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:00,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going out of town in a couple of days,
for a month, on a job</font>

141
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,447
<font color=#FFFF00>If you ever feel you need to go to
someplace just to be by yourself</font>

142
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:06,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Use it</font>

143
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:07,646
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you</font>

144
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Will the rest of you gentlemen please.</font>

145
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,743
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously, it's money. It'll be fun.</font>

146
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I can't go</font>

147
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,613
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a four man job.
We can't do it without you</font>

148
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:51,403
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, I know,
but a couple of things have come up and</font>

149
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:54,383
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not comfortable being
away for a month right now.</font>

150
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:54,894
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim?</font>

151
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,856
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not Kim.</font>

152
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:00,466
<font color=#FFFF00>Man, you got to let this go. Lenore is a
grown women she can take care of herself.</font>

153
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:02,095
<font color=#FFFF00>Your not her husband any longer.</font>

154
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,230
<font color=#FFFF00>But she is my friend</font>

155
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,901
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you better talk
to somebody about this.</font>

156
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:06,968
<font color=#FFFF00>A shrink maybe?</font>

157
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,792
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I go to a shrink
when I got you guys?</font>

158
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Well there's a good point</font>

159
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:12,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Could somebody drop the flag stick?</font>

160
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,077
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey Kim, what's up?</font>

161
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,688
<font color=#FFFF00>-You want me to take it out?
-If you wouldn't mind.</font>

162
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure! When?</font>

163
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,755
<font color=#FFFF00>-Oh come on.
-OK, baby.</font>

164
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:22,708
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on!</font>

165
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,380
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, the big moment.</font>

166
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,201
<font color=#FFFF00>-That's a good...
-Oh!</font>

167
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,224
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, this is an unexpected treat</font>

168
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, I um...need some advice</font>

169
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,536
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, shoot.</font>

170
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,363
<font color=#FFFF00>So, its um...</font>

171
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:44,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess its not something I was really
planning on here or even thought about.</font>

172
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:45,801
<font color=#FFFF00>ever.</font>

173
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I just wanted your advice.</font>

174
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm flattered.</font>

175
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow.</font>

176
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:53,824
<font color=#FFFF00>Poor lady.</font>

177
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:58,407
<font color=#FFFF00>That it going to be serious trouble
in a few years. You mark my words.</font>

178
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,605
<font color=#FFFF00>So, what was it you wanted to ask?</font>

179
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:04,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

180
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:09,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...Puppy.</font>

181
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:10,594
<font color=#FFFF00>A puppy?</font>

182
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, I was thinking about getting a puppy.</font>

183
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:18,149
<font color=#FFFF00>-From where?
-Um, my friend found one behind a building.</font>

184
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,202
<font color=#FFFF00>-Uh huh
-We were trying to find it a home.</font>

185
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,620
<font color=#FFFF00>You know we put it on Facebook,
but nobody claimed it yet, so.</font>

186
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Wanna know what I think?</font>

187
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

188
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,339
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean its alot of work,
alot of responsibility,</font>

189
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,377
<font color=#FFFF00>and with your lifestyle
and your going to college</font>

190
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,614
<font color=#FFFF00>But a puppy you have to
be there all the time.</font>

191
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Feed it, walk it.
No different than having a kid</font>

192
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:44,688
<font color=#FFFF00>-Have you had a chance to look at the menu?
-Not yet, Annie.</font>

193
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,530
<font color=#FFFF00>What will I have?</font>

194
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,256
<font color=#FFFF00>-Stuart.
-Hey Brian.</font>

195
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:55,200
<font color=#FFFF00>-What are you doing here?
-Um...</font>

196
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything alright?
-Yeah, its fine, its fine.</font>

197
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I talk to you inside?</font>

198
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, yeah, sure.
I was just making some coffee.</font>

199
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,601
<font color=#FFFF00>-Milk? Sugar?
-Um, both please.</font>

200
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:07,867
<font color=#FFFF00>OK.</font>

201
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,813
<font color=#FFFF00>-Milk, cold or hot?
-Uh...</font>

202
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:11,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Hot.</font>

203
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,358
<font color=#FFFF00>So, how's business?</font>

204
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you know. Some days good.
Some days great.</font>

205
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:23,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

206
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,395
<font color=#FFFF00>-One sugar or two?
-Two, please.</font>

207
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:31,965
<font color=#FFFF00>-Here we go.
-Thanks.</font>

208
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,216
<font color=#FFFF00>Um...</font>

209
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,835
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to bother you this late,
but I thought it was more um...</font>

210
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:46,938
<font color=#FFFF00>respectful to say what I have to say you.
Face to face. Man to man, so to speak.</font>

211
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,277
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, I know that Lenore has</font>

212
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:53,194
<font color=#FFFF00>she's spoken to you about the
problems that we've been having.</font>

213
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:53,566
<font color=#FFFF00>um</font>

214
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,804
<font color=#FFFF00>Your a good guy, Brian.
I like you. Your a respectful guy</font>

215
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,482
<font color=#FFFF00>And listen, I'm not accusing you of anything.
But</font>

216
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenore and I If your marriage is gonna work,</font>

217
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,333
<font color=#FFFF00>that can't happen with you in between us.</font>

218
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:14,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart, there's nothing between
Lenore and I other than we share Kim.</font>

219
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,187
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't say there was.</font>

220
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,856
<font color=#FFFF00>You know obviously you share a daughter and</font>

221
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,437
<font color=#FFFF00>your tried to be the best
father that you can.</font>

222
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,758
<font color=#FFFF00>Under the circumstances.</font>

223
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,514
<font color=#FFFF00>And part of that means the two of
you talking and staying in touch.</font>

224
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:32,517
<font color=#FFFF00>But, I still want you to stop seeing my wife.</font>

225
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,622
<font color=#FFFF00>Until we sort things out.</font>

226
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,069
<font color=#FFFF00>-Does she know your here?</font>

227
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,704
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't matter if she does or
if she doesn't. That's not the point.</font>

228
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,057
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm asking you to stop
seeing my wife. Can you do that?</font>

229
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do that.</font>

230
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, that's great. Thank you.</font>

231
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,696
<font color=#FFFF00>You know I got to go to Vegas tonight some
business meeting tomorrow.</font>

232
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,833
<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't want to be worrying about</font>

233
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,544
<font color=#FFFF00>-you know
-Yeah.</font>

234
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:00,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

235
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,707
<font color=#FFFF00>I really appreciate it.</font>

236
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,556
<font color=#FFFF00>Need to see you. Urgent. Bagels.</font>

237
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll have four bagels and some cream cheese,
please.</font>

238
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,317
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, be careful they're really hot.</font>

239
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

240
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,636
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a good day.</font>

241
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:02,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care. -Thanks.</font>

242
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

243
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:14,791
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenny?</font>

244
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:37,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenny?</font>

245
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:45,501
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenny?</font>

246
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:46,865
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenny?</font>

247
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:51,052
<font color=#FFFF00>Jesus Christ! Lenny, wake up!</font>

248
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:55,366
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, come on, come on! Lenny!</font>

249
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,306
<font color=#FFFF00>Freeze! Don't move!</font>

250
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:58,918
<font color=#FFFF00>-Step away from the knife!</font>

251
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,245
<font color=#FFFF00>-Get your hands up!
-Sir, back away now!</font>

252
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,191
<font color=#FFFF00>-I didn't do this.
-Get your hands up, now!</font>

253
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:06,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Slowly!</font>

254
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,780
<font color=#FFFF00>-Get your hands up!
-You got to listen to me!</font>

255
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:09,849
<font color=#FFFF00>-One the floor, now!
-Listen to me!</font>

256
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,695
<font color=#FFFF00>-Down on the floor, now!
-Listen to me!</font>

257
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,387
<font color=#FFFF00>On your knees!</font>

00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:15,463
<font color=#FFFF00>Now!</font>

259
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:17,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Put your hands up!</font>

260
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,413
<font color=#FFFF00>Hands up!</font>

261
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,658
<font color=#FFFF00>Hands up!</font>

262
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,942
<font color=#FFFF00>Higher! Higher!</font>

263
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:25,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't do this.</font>

264
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:38,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Shit! Over there!</font>

265
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:45,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Get em!</font>

266
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, he's heading west!</font>

267
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:39,191
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop!</font>

268
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Get inside. I'll be back.</font>

269
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:10,791
<font color=#FFFF00>Police, freeze!</font>

270
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,396
<font color=#FFFF00>-Door is sealed. I just saw him inside.
-Shit!</font>

271
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Clear! Moving in!</font>

272
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You see him anywhere?</font>

273
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,577
<font color=#FFFF00>He disappeared.</font>

274
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,646
<font color=#FFFF00>God damn it, he's gone.</font>

275
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:54,202
<font color=#FFFF00>This is 103, suspects gone.</font>

276
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,852
<font color=#FFFF00>-Yeah
-Kim, Its dad.</font>

277
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:13,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?</font>

278
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:16,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm at mom's. Looking for my yellow sweater.</font>

279
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:17,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you alone?</font>

280
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,712
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuarts in Vegas, why?</font>

281

282
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,309
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad?</font>

00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:28,739
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, whats wrong?</font>

284
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:33,162
<font color=#FFFF00>Something terrible has happened and I
wanted you to hear it from me first.</font>

285
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mom...</font>

286
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,721
<font color=#FFFF00>She's dead.</font>

287
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:40,877
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone murdered her.</font>

288
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,603
<font color=#FFFF00>In my apartment.</font>

289
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,814
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like I did it. I don't know why,
I don't know who, but I'm gonna find out.</font>

290
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:53,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen carefully, Kim.</font>

291
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,720
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what anyone says,
don't trust them.</font>

292
00:22:55,912 --> 00:22:56,218
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

293
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,688
<font color=#FFFF00>-You hear?
-I'll find a way to contact you.</font>

294
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,078
<font color=#FFFF00>-Dad?
-Try to be strong.</font>

295
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,400
<font color=#FFFF00>-Dad?
-I love you.</font>

296
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait!</font>

297
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:20,042
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to check this out, alright?</font>

298
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,386
<font color=#FFFF00>Sargent Dotzler, suspect name is Brian Mills.</font>

299
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,016
<font color=#FFFF00>His?</font>

300
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:48,992
<font color=#FFFF00>His.</font>

301
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,686
<font color=#FFFF00>Not his.</font>

302
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,066
<font color=#FFFF00>Your officers happen to see him because?</font>

303
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,197
<font color=#FFFF00>We got this call. Came in reported a women</font>

304
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,670
<font color=#FFFF00>screaming, "He's killing
me, he's killing me"</font>

305
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:06,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Her name is Lenore St. john.</font>

306
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:08,394
<font color=#FFFF00>We sent a card to her address
that was listed on her license.</font>

307
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,762
<font color=#FFFF00>Her daughter was there but her husband
was in Las Vegas on some business</font>

308
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,618
<font color=#FFFF00>He's, uh, taking the first flight home.</font>

309
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:13,603
<font color=#FFFF00>Any witnesses?</font>

310
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:14,995
<font color=#FFFF00>The cameras didn't see anything at all.</font>

311
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,883
<font color=#FFFF00>Call came from an unlisted number</font>

312
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:18,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll had them checked out the cells as well</font>

313
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Download both the phones. Encrypt the data.</font>

314
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,676
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanna know when these two people...</font>

315
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:28,646
<font color=#FFFF00>spoke, text, emailed.
Every form of communication.</font>

316
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Date, times, durations of calls.</font>

317
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,431
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets bag this.</font>

318
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,283
<font color=#FFFF00>Take that. Bag it up.</font>

319
00:24:54,678 --> 00:24:55,139
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

320
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:58,266
<font color=#FFFF00>Good.</font>

321
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,722
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now this is still a
very active crime scene.</font>

322
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,884
<font color=#FFFF00>investigators have been here,
on the scene, all morning but so far,</font>

323
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:08,286
<font color=#FFFF00>police have not told us what
happened inside the apartment</font>

324
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:12,064
<font color=#FFFF00>where, earlier this morning,
a women's body was discovered.</font>

325
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:16,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Brian Mill's is the owner of the apartment
and the ex-husband of the deceased.</font>

326
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,338
<font color=#FFFF00>-Who's this?
-It's me.</font>

327
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,643
<font color=#FFFF00>-Your on the news
- i didn't do it, Sam.</font>

328
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,977
<font color=#FFFF00>Obviously you didn't do it.
Are you alright?</font>

329
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,669
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going down the rabbit hole.</font>

330
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:28,306
<font color=#FFFF00>-The code still the same?
-Yeah, yeah, its still the same.</font>

331
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,752
<font color=#FFFF00>-I'll be in touch.
-Be careful.</font>

332
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,306
<font color=#FFFF00>So this is the area we lost him, sir.</font>

333
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:39,351
<font color=#FFFF00>It got fetched.</font>

334
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:43,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Uh, thats the gun that he took
off one of our officers, sir.</font>

335
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:45,217
<font color=#FFFF00>He had a gun?</font>

336
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,456
<font color=#FFFF00>And he didn't fire at you?</font>

337
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:47,365
<font color=#FFFF00>No, sir.</font>

338
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,539
<font color=#FFFF00>And the Helicopters? So whats their view?</font>

339
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Choppers didn't see anything, Sargent.</font>

340
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:04,277
<font color=#FFFF00>I know he's good.</font>

341
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:05,409
<font color=#FFFF00>But</font>

342
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:10,433
<font color=#FFFF00>Vanish into thin air?</font>

343
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:12,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets move the truck.</font>

344
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:28,373
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know why your wife
went to visit Mr. Mills?</font>

345
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,808
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't know.</font>

346
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,223
<font color=#FFFF00>You know there relationship was
mostly centered around their daughter.</font>

347
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:37,454
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, but I think that he
wanted more than friendship</font>

348
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:43,146
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked her to speak to him and tell him
that she should stop bothering her about it</font>

349
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,486
<font color=#FFFF00>So you think that's what
she was doing over there?</font>

350
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,171
<font color=#FFFF00>-I don't know.
-What are you doing?font</font>

351
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart?
Why are they going through my mom's stuff?</font>

352
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey Kim.</font>

353
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,362
<font color=#FFFF00>Mrs. St. John.</font>

354
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:55,250
<font color=#FFFF00>-Franck Dotzler.
-Mills.</font>

355
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,880
<font color=#FFFF00>My name is Mills.</font>

356
00:27:57,674 --> 00:28:00,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I just have for a few minutes of
your time. Ask you a few questions.</font>

357
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you out there trying
to find out who did this?</font>

358
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:05,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead of standing around
going through our home.</font>

359
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:07,332
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't be bound through looking</font>

360
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,402
<font color=#FFFF00>But in order for me to get a full picture,</font>

361
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:11,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to ask questions of him
and questions of you.</font>

362
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:13,806
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom went to see my dad. I don't know why.</font>

363
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:16,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Probably to talk about me.</font>

364
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,558
<font color=#FFFF00>Look, there's just</font>

365
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,950
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't do it!</font>

366
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:25,055
<font color=#FFFF00>He just didn't. He didn't do it.
There's no way on earth he would</font>

367
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:25,906
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Kim.</font>

368
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:26,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Just don't!</font>

369
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:34,530
<font color=#FFFF00>He loved her.</font>

370
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,321
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all I know.</font>

371
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:47,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Please.</font>

372
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,656
<font color=#FFFF00>That's mine. That's not even hers.</font>

373
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,487
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

374
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,214
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

375
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,520
<font color=#FFFF00>-God!
-Come on, lets get you home.</font>

376
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,666
<font color=#FFFF00>If something comes to mind, anything at all.</font>

377
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:57,436
<font color=#FFFF00>You know it might not be anything, um...</font>

378
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:00,267
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what happen in
Paris and Istanbul,</font>

379
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,581
<font color=#FFFF00>a couple of years ago,
were Bryan saved his family.</font>

380
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:05,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, you that's connected to this?</font>

381
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:10,202
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, I never really wanted
to know all the details. But,</font>

382
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,975
<font color=#FFFF00>A lot of people ended up dead and now this?</font>

383
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:17,361
<font color=#FFFF00>So what your telling me is...</font>

384
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,087
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm dealing with a very dangerous man.</font>

385
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

386
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Brian's not dangerous.</font>

387
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,135
<font color=#FFFF00>The world he lives in is.</font>

388
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:27,270
<font color=#FFFF00>He loves his family.</font>

389
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:29,366
<font color=#FFFF00>But he has a lot of enemies.</font>

390
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,034
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

391
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:43,484
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring him into room 3.</font>

392
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,536
<font color=#FFFF00>Garcia, will uh, get you back home.</font>

393
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:48,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

394
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:31,720
<font color=#FFFF00>This guy is a ghost.</font>

395
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:33,129
<font color=#FFFF00>at 21</font>

396
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:34,426
<font color=#FFFF00>he's in the army</font>

397
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:35,407
<font color=#FFFF00>at 23</font>

398
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:36,820
<font color=#FFFF00>he joins special forces.</font>

399
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:38,066
<font color=#FFFF00>He's good.</font>

400
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:42,219
<font color=#FFFF00>No service records.
No discharge. Nothing! Nothing!</font>

401
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:43,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds like spy shit to me.</font>

402
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,978
<font color=#FFFF00>And until we have another suspect,
he's our man.</font>

403
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:47,884
<font color=#FFFF00>So here's our best way of finding him.</font>

404
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,176
<font color=#FFFF00>His daughter with the deceased.</font>

405
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,248
<font color=#FFFF00>The husband says that he
is really close to her.</font>

406
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Devoted to her.</font>

407
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,561
<font color=#FFFF00>So lets keep a close watch on her.</font>

408
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Where she goes, who she calls,
who she talks to.</font>

409
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets not screw this up, OK?</font>

410
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,464
<font color=#FFFF00>So this is gonna be our
best shot at finding him.</font>

411
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:04,321
<font color=#FFFF00>Do we have the deceased car?</font>

412
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that just came in.</font>

413
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:07,909
<font color=#FFFF00>- There it is still.
-Alright.</font>

416
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:15,641
<font color=#FFFF00>see if they correlate.</font>

417
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:18,283
<font color=#FFFF00>See if we can find out what's going on.</font>

418
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Just came in, its a nerves.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

421
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:55,835
<font color=#FFFF00>So, what's this about?</font>

422
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,364
<font color=#FFFF00>-Some guy offed his ex.
-Allegedly</font>

423
00:33:59,441 --> 00:33:59,926
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

424
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:01,184
<font color=#FFFF00>Allegedly</font>

425
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:14,284
<font color=#FFFF00>-He didn't do her in the car, did he?
-Nah, at his house.</font>

426
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:16,357
<font color=#FFFF00>Good, I hate to clean it up after.</font>

427
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Blood.</font>

428
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,367
<font color=#FFFF00>pieces of flesh and shit that is disgusting.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>-His first.
-Right over her.</font>

432
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:55,477
<font color=#FFFF00>What the hell were you doing
all the way out there, Leonore.</font>

433
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

434

<font color=#FFFF00>Inspector Malry LAPD.</font>

435
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:08,678
<font color=#FFFF00>We're following up on a
missing person investigation.</font>

436
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Was wondering if you've seen this women?</font>

00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,835
<font color=#FFFF00>-She was her about 10pm last night.
-I was here then.</font>

439
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,088
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't see her.</font>

440
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't see hardly nobody.</font>

441
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:21,957
<font color=#FFFF00>not exactly a best selling
destination if you know what I mean.</font>

442
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:22,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Sarah.</font>

443
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, duty calls.</font>

444
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,316
<font color=#FFFF00>Amanda</font>

445
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,377
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

446
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Inspector Malry LAPD.</font>

447
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,147
<font color=#FFFF00>Are these security cameras operative
or are they just there for show?</font>

448
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:42,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah they work.</font>

449
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:44,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

450
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:46,631
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the tape from yesterday?</font>

451
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:48,317
<font color=#FFFF00>No I wasn't here. The other guy was.</font>

452
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:50,085
<font color=#FFFF00>If someone was here, it'd be on there.</font>

453
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,266
<font color=#FFFF00>Just push that button for playback.</font>

454
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:59,013
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just gonna stay here
while you look at that.</font>

455
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,291
<font color=#FFFF00>you have problems with this system?</font>

456
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,556
<font color=#FFFF00>It breaks down sometimes.
They keep saying their going to replace it.</font>

457
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:32,613
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

458
00:36:33,117 --> 00:36:34,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you seen this women?</font>

459
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:40,078
<font color=#FFFF00>-You fellows should get more coordinated.
-Coordinated?</font>

460
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,065
<font color=#FFFF00>What you mean? Like color coordinated?</font>

461
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,697
<font color=#FFFF00>No, like one of your guys was just
in here asking the same thing.</font>

462
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:45,689
<font color=#FFFF00>One of our guys?</font>

463
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:46,256
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

464
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:50,252
<font color=#FFFF00>-Him?
-Yeah.</font>

465
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:50,669
<font color=#FFFF00>Him.</font>

466
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,224
<font color=#FFFF00>Took off to the gas station.</font>

467
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:04,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Shh</font>

468
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:37,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Freeze!</font>

469
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:40,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Mills!</font>

470
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,276
<font color=#FFFF00>Freeze!</font>

471
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:43,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Step out buddy!</font>

472
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,464
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up out of here!</font>

473
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:45,422
<font color=#FFFF00>Freeze!</font>

474
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:48,442
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop what our doing, Mr. Mills.
Step away from the desk!</font>

475
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:50,805
<font color=#FFFF00>-Back away from that desk.
-Step away from that desk!</font>

476
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,064
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll shoot you!</font>

477
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Step away from the God Damn desk, now!</font>

478
00:37:56,549 --> 00:37:58,443
<font color=#FFFF00>Step away one step from the desk!</font>

479
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Just keep your hands were we can see them.</font>

480
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,713
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay perfectly still!</font>

481
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:13,740
<font color=#FFFF00>You know the drill.</font>

482
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,787
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything you say can and will be
used against you in the court of law.</font>

483
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,239
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the right to an attorney.</font>

484
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,400
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have one present
during questioning...</font>

485
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Garcia and smith, they got him.</font>

486
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,853
<font color=#FFFF00>-He's here?
-Yeah, just picked him up.</font>

487
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,279
<font color=#FFFF00>Easy peasy</font>

488
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:18,335
<font color=#FFFF00>If he was a pro, like you said.
He wasn't on his game today.</font>

489
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,112
<font color=#FFFF00>-He's playing you.
-What are you talking about?</font>

490
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:23,271
<font color=#FFFF00>-Where is he? Where is he?
-He's back in Phillips care, why?</font>

491
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,097
<font color=#FFFF00>-Stop the cars!
-What!?</font>

492
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,761
<font color=#FFFF00>-Stop the cars!</font>

493
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:26,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Now!</font>

494
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:29,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Aw, come on.</font>

495
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:35,013
<font color=#FFFF00>-Phillips.
-Yeah.</font>

496
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:37,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Our boss has got a hair
up his ass about something.</font>

497
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,694
<font color=#FFFF00>Just keep an eye on this guy, alright?</font>

498
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:41,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, OK.</font>

499
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:44,721
<font color=#FFFF00>They think we're idiots. It's unbelievable.</font>

500
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:49,171
<font color=#FFFF00>-He acts like I never done this before.
-He's just being Dotzler</font>

501
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:50,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Nah, you know what it is?
He's a control freak.</font>

502
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,845
<font color=#FFFF00>If he's not doing it himself, he's not happy.</font>

503
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,126
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep driving!</font>

504
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:32,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Phillips!</font>

505
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:35,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on!</font>

506
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:06,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my God! What the hell is he doing!?</font>

507
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:20,903
<font color=#FFFF00>Pull it over!</font>

508
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:54,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Back it up!</font>

509
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of the car!</font>

510
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:10,926
<font color=#FFFF00>Drive!</font>

511
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:23,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Drive, Come on!</font>

512
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:25,658
<font color=#FFFF00>Now move!</font>

513
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Radio!</font>

514
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,161
<font color=#FFFF00>Cell phone!</font>

515
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:35,373
<font color=#FFFF00>-This is gonna end bad for you.
-Don't be such a pessimist</font>

516
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:47,295
<font color=#FFFF00>Connecting to LAPD computer files</font>

517
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:57,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Calling unit a code 10-29
on police con number 706</font>

518
00:42:57,772 --> 00:42:59,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Number 706.</font>

519
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:05,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Suspect in sight!</font>

520
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:39,934
<font color=#FFFF00>Move! Move! Move!</font>

521
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:41,958
<font color=#FFFF00>LAPD! Freeze!</font>

522
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:05,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Send some back up, now!</font>

523
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:04,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Dotzler</font>

524
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,888
<font color=#FFFF00>By now I'm sure you know who I am.</font>

525
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:08,278
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what I'm capable of.</font>

526
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:11,616
<font color=#FFFF00>CIA operative. 66' 67' what?</font>

527
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:13,853
<font color=#FFFF00>All you have to know is I'm innocent.</font>

528
00:45:14,273 --> 00:45:16,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me 2 days and I can prove it.
I can find out who did it.</font>

529
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>You may very well be innocent, Mr. Mills.</font>

530
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:21,737
<font color=#FFFF00>But that's the courts job to decide,
not mine.</font>

531
00:45:22,432 --> 00:45:25,256
<font color=#FFFF00>My job is to bring you in and let
nature take its course. Thats it.</font>

532
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:27,413
<font color=#FFFF00>Good luck.</font>

533
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,822
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, I got a GPS on the phone. He's
heading North. You want me to send units?</font>

534
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:46,322
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't bother. He's gone.</font>

535
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,458
<font color=#FFFF00>-Dead end.
-Wait, wait.</font>

536
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:57,275
<font color=#FFFF00>-He wants us to watch it.
-Why?</font>

537
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know yet.</font>

538
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:02,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Who she waiting for?</font>

539
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:08,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are these guys?!</font>

540
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:11,551
<font color=#FFFF00>Holy shit!</font>

541
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:12,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are these guys?!</font>

542
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:18,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Get me a tech guy. I need some magic
done on a security tape, now. Right now!</font>

543
00:46:30,347 --> 00:46:31,557
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, let me guess.</font>

544
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:34,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Pile up on the 710N</font>

545
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:38,077
<font color=#FFFF00>massive cluster of police
vehicles 15 miles heading south</font>

546
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:39,822
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds about right.</font>

547
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:42,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, thanks Sam.</font>

548
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:46,896
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to tell me what's going on?</font>

549
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:49,291
<font color=#FFFF00>Lenore sent me a text.</font>

550
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:51,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Asked to come over to my place for bagels.</font>

551
00:46:51,414 --> 00:46:52,283
<font color=#FFFF00>I got the bagels.</font>

552
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,341
<font color=#FFFF00>When I came back, I found her car out front.</font>

553
00:46:56,987 --> 00:46:57,639
<font color=#FFFF00>and</font>

554
00:46:57,842 --> 00:46:59,729
<font color=#FFFF00>she was in my bed with her throat slashed.</font>

555
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh Jesus.</font>

556
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:06,063
<font color=#FFFF00>What else?</font>

557
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:09,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I found a location on her car's
GPS from the night before.</font>

558
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:12,109
<font color=#FFFF00>She was out of this gas station
in the middle of nowhere</font>

559
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw it on the security camera</font>

560
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:15,633
<font color=#FFFF00>She was snatched.</font>

561
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,134
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want us to do?</font>

562
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I downloaded all the phone records
from the police files. I'm on it.</font>

563
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,817
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe there's something there.</font>

564
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't notice that this</font>

565
00:47:27,435 --> 00:47:28,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Her hair</font>

566
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:30,491
<font color=#FFFF00>It might turn up something.
It might turn up nothing.</font>

567
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything else?</font>

568
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:33,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to go to the funeral</font>

569
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:37,780
<font color=#FFFF00>The Bible constantly tells us</font>

570
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:39,564
<font color=#FFFF00>that there will be difficult times in life.</font>

571
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:43,980
<font color=#FFFF00>When we feel like we are walking to a dark,
dangerous valley.</font>

572
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,566
<font color=#FFFF00>-Valley of the shadow of death.
-Are you OK?</font>

573
00:47:47,024 --> 00:47:49,468
<font color=#FFFF00>But what the Word of God does make very clear</font>

574
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,430
<font color=#FFFF00>is that as we move through such times</font>

575
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,546
<font color=#FFFF00>the LORD is my Shepard and He maketh
me to lie down in green pastors</font>

576
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:59,361
<font color=#FFFF00>He leadeth me besides still waters</font>

577
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:02,979
<font color=#FFFF00>In the name of the Father</font>

578
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,416
<font color=#FFFF00>and of the Son</font>

579
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:05,902
<font color=#FFFF00>And of the Holy Spirit</font>

580
00:48:12,886 --> 00:48:13,679
<font color=#FFFF00>you already know</font>

581
00:48:15,947 --> 00:48:16,521
<font color=#FFFF00>Right there.</font>

582
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:18,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Get me sound on that.</font>

583
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:19,686
<font color=#FFFF00>Right there.</font>

584
00:48:19,995 --> 00:48:20,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim.</font>

585
00:48:21,325 --> 00:48:22,127
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry.</font>

586
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:24,609
<font color=#FFFF00>If there's anything we can do</font>

587
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:27,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey</font>

588
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,559
<font color=#FFFF00>We're there for you. You know that, right?</font>

589
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,201
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey baby</font>

590
00:48:37,602 --> 00:48:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to go home</font>

591
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:42,706
<font color=#FFFF00>You hear that?</font>

592
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,677
<font color=#FFFF00>Hear the click?</font>

593
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,761
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah,
I'm getting some interference somewhere.</font>

594
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:53,097
<font color=#FFFF00>He's gonna go to Kim now</font>

595
00:48:53,912 --> 00:48:54,590
<font color=#FFFF00>-Hey
-Hi</font>

596
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,437
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh sweetie</font>

597
00:48:58,198 --> 00:48:59,541
<font color=#FFFF00>They're jamming our signal</font>

598
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,567
<font color=#FFFF00>I know</font>

599
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:01,842
<font color=#FFFF00>I know</font>

600
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:03,743
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so, so sorry</font>

601
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen</font>

602
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,861
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll be in touch</font>

603
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,812
<font color=#FFFF00>just stick to your schedule</font>

604
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Your very predictable schedule</font>

605
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:46,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You want me to put a tail on him?</font>

606
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Nah, it's a waste of time.
They're always about winning</font>

607
00:49:49,274 --> 00:49:51,354
<font color=#FFFF00>These guys could lose a tail
if it was attached to a dog</font>

608
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:52,975
<font color=#FFFF00>We're done.</font>

609
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:54,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Cut the feed</font>

610
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:26,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart, why are there still</font>

611
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,013
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are there still cops camped outside?</font>

612
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:32,519
<font color=#FFFF00>Uh, I think it's just
standard operating procedure.</font>

613
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:34,387
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think my dad
is gonna show up here?</font>

614
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Are they stupid or something?</font>

615
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:37,531
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what they think.</font>

616
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:40,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Inspector Dotzler asked
if we minded and I said no</font>

617
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,771
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have asked me.</font>

618
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:42,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I mind</font>

619
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:44,708
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry</font>

620
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:46,722
<font color=#FFFF00>And who's he?</font>

621
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:48,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, we um...</font>

622
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:49,777
<font color=#FFFF00>we need protection</font>

623
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim, honey, I know it's hard on
you but it's hard on me, too.</font>

624
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I didn't realize
it was a competition</font>

625
00:50:58,531 --> 00:50:59,156
<font color=#FFFF00>It's...</font>

626
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,955
<font color=#FFFF00>it's not a competition, please.</font>

627
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:03,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't hate me</font>

628
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:05,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not responsible for what happen</font>

629
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:07,866
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't hate you, Stuart</font>

630
00:51:09,006 --> 00:51:10,539
<font color=#FFFF00>But for the last 2 years</font>

631
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:15,773
<font color=#FFFF00>every time I looked into my mom's eyes
the only thing I saw was hurt and sadness</font>

632
00:51:16,716 --> 00:51:20,464
<font color=#FFFF00>And for that, I do hold you responsible</font>

633
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,354
<font color=#FFFF00>-Where're you going?
-School</font>

634
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:28,656
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm allowed</font>

635
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:20,877
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you following me?</font>

636
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:22,667
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for your own protection, miss.</font>

637
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:23,408
<font color=#FFFF00>Protection?</font>

638
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:24,579
<font color=#FFFF00>From who?</font>

639
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:25,829
<font color=#FFFF00>My father?</font>

640
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:28,888
<font color=#FFFF00>You really think my father would hurt me?</font>

641
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,946
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother probably didn't think so either</font>

642
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:33,039
<font color=#FFFF00>Asshole</font>

643
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:40,572
<font color=#FFFF00>-Hi
-Hey</font>

644
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Drink me now</font>

645
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:16,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything?</font>

646
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:18,232
<font color=#FFFF00>She's on campus. You want me to follow?</font>

647
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:19,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Is the bug active?</font>

648
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:20,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

649
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:21,751
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, stay near her</font>

650
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Really soon. If he shows up we're here</font>

651
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:24,809
<font color=#FFFF00>What else?</font>

652
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,905
<font color=#FFFF00>She went to this convenient
store and chugged</font>

653
00:53:27,097 --> 00:53:28,842
<font color=#FFFF00>down a drink of some kind from the fridge</font>

654
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:29,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Uh huh</font>

655
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it skinny or fat?</font>

656
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:05,199
<font color=#FFFF00>As you might remember last week</font>

657
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,018
<font color=#FFFF00>We discussed dissociation
and interactions between</font>

658
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:13,264
<font color=#FFFF00>dorsal and ventral streams
in object recognition...</font>

659
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:19,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that the dorsal stream is supporting
motor interactions with objects</font>

660
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,332
<font color=#FFFF00>while ventral streams
structures extract visual</font>

661
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:25,587
<font color=#FFFF00>information about the
object that is independent</font>

662
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:27,260
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm feeling a bit nauseous</font>

663
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,940
<font color=#FFFF00>-Can you right the notes for me?
-Yeah, sure</font>

664
00:54:29,942 --> 00:54:30,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks</font>

665
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:34,651
<font color=#FFFF00>Now in other words, object knowledge
is represented in ventral streams</font>

666
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, I wonder if you could
help me out with something.</font>

667
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:45,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure</font>

668
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:49,812
<font color=#FFFF00>There was a young women in here.
About an hour ago</font>

669
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:50,513
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh yeah</font>

670
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:51,682
<font color=#FFFF00>Poor kid</font>

671
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:52,378
<font color=#FFFF00>She come here often?</font>

672
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:53,533
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyday</font>

673
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:56,580
<font color=#FFFF00>-She bought when?
-Same thing. Peach, yogurt, drink</font>

674
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,994
<font color=#FFFF00>But today,
she drank it all right there from the fridge</font>

675
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:00,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Must have been thirsty</font>

676
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:19,513
<font color=#FFFF00>Get anything?</font>

677
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:21,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, she went to school.
Got nauseous in class</font>

678
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:23,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Now she's on her way to the bathroom</font>

679
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Call for back up! I'm coming right now!</font>

680
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:44,784
<font color=#FFFF00>Shh</font>

681
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:08,521
<font color=#FFFF00>Here Kim, drink this. I put something
in the yogurt to make you nauseous</font>

682
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:09,401
<font color=#FFFF00>this will take it away</font>

683
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi baby</font>

684
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:18,606
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi</font>

685
00:56:22,952 --> 00:56:24,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh Kimmy</font>

686
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:27,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh Kim</font>

687
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:30,481
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad</font>

688
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,880
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to do</font>

689
00:56:33,232 --> 00:56:34,146
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pregnant</font>

690
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:37,035
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

691
00:56:40,627 --> 00:56:41,643
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pregnant</font>

692
00:56:46,756 --> 00:56:47,107
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad</font>

693
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:48,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm OK</font>

694
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:54,143
<font color=#FFFF00>I have low blood sugar.
I haven't eaten since yesterday</font>

695
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:00,154
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat this</font>

696
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:14,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't, don't you worry</font>

697
00:57:14,777 --> 00:57:18,482
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets get through this first,
and then we'll figure out what's best for</font>

698
00:57:19,956 --> 00:57:23,432
<font color=#FFFF00>What you have to do, Kim, is act natural.
This cop is really smart.</font>

699
00:57:23,879 --> 00:57:26,262
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything out of the usual
he becomes suspicious, OK?</font>

700
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:30,495
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you</font>

701
00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:32,339
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you, too</font>

702
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:44,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

703
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you?</font>

704
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in the science building east left</font>

705
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:48,772
<font color=#FFFF00>-She's in the bathroom.
-Don't move.</font>

706
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:49,783
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait for me.</font>

707
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:55,761
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you staying?</font>

708
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm still at mom's</font>

709
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,476
<font color=#FFFF00>I started packing her stuff</font>

710
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,152
<font color=#FFFF00>it just...</font>

711
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:04,240
<font color=#FFFF00>it doesn't feel real</font>

712
00:58:04,824 --> 00:58:05,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh I know</font>

713
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:07,311
<font color=#FFFF00>I know</font>

714
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:15,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad there's...</font>

715
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:18,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuarts been acting really weird</font>

716
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:21,097
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be scared about something.
He hired body guards.</font>

717
00:58:24,346 --> 00:58:27,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my God it was so fun.
But you know what he was such a jerk</font>

718
00:58:28,149 --> 00:58:28,364
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

719
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:29,912
<font color=#FFFF00>He made me pay for my own drink at the bar</font>

720
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:33,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I did! I was wearing something
like more skimpier than this</font>

721
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,958
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? More skimpier than that?</font>

722
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,177
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll hear you</font>

723
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:47,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not gonna do it again there.</font>

724
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,266
<font color=#FFFF00>I completely understand</font>

725
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:57,036
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh!</font>

726
00:58:58,357 --> 00:58:59,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Move, move, move, move, move</font>

727
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:13,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me!</font>

728
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:15,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Perv!</font>

729
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:18,977
<font color=#FFFF00>He just left.</font>

730
00:59:20,841 --> 00:59:21,795
<font color=#FFFF00>She's in the can.</font>

731
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't let you leave.</font>

732
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:29,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Seal entrances</font>

733
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:35,887
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

734
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:48,328
<font color=#FFFF00>There he is.</font>

735
00:59:48,942 --> 00:59:49,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Gotta stop the water!</font>

736
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:50,752
<font color=#FFFF00>Freeze!</font>

737
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:53,605
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you think your helping him.</font>

738
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,007
<font color=#FFFF00>But your not</font>

739
01:00:56,176 --> 01:00:56,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Your not.</font>

740
01:00:57,439 --> 01:00:58,650
<font color=#FFFF00>This we can't recommend</font>

741
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,106
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't start trying to
make sense of what happened</font>

742
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,143
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone killed my mom.</font>

743
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:04,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what happen</font>

744
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:07,576
<font color=#FFFF00>It was not my father</font>

745
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,408
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't heard his side of the story</font>

746
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,533
<font color=#FFFF00>They can't know that can they?</font>

747
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:11,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

748
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there anything else?</font>

749
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:18,957
<font color=#FFFF00>You know we can arrest you for
obstructing an ongoing investigation.</font>

750
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:21,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Arrest me.</font>

751
01:01:24,158 --> 01:01:25,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I rather not.</font>

752
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:27,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Well then, If your not going to</font>

753
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,157
<font color=#FFFF00>can I go home?</font>

754
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Course.</font>

755
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:31,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Course.</font>

756
01:01:36,462 --> 01:01:37,315
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

757
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:47,176
<font color=#FFFF00>Interesting family</font>

758
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

759
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,740
<font color=#FFFF00>We will take care of this.</font>

760
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:56,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Do as we planned.</font>

761
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,543
<font color=#FFFF00>Call the car</font>

762
01:01:57,919 --> 01:01:58,792
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are we going boss?</font>

763
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:01,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Malibu house.</font>

764
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:49,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, lets go get drunk.</font>

765
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not gonna hurt you.</font>

766
01:04:10,566 --> 01:04:11,146
<font color=#FFFF00>I need a ride.</font>

767
01:04:11,757 --> 01:04:13,548
<font color=#FFFF00>-Mind if i drive?
-OK.</font>

768
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:26,654
<font color=#FFFF00>You can go.</font>

769
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:34,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Uh huh</font>

770
01:04:34,885 --> 01:04:38,223
<font color=#FFFF00>You when you stand in the
field with a box of matches.</font>

771
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:42,374
<font color=#FFFF00>You can have hundreds of
rabbits in seconds like this</font>

772
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,822
<font color=#FFFF00>-You know how?
-No.</font>

773
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in all rabbits</font>

774
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,543
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in all rabbits</font>

775
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:54,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Like this</font>

776
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:14,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Who hired you?</font>

777
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:17,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Huh!</font>

778
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:20,666
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you working for?</font>

779
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:23,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Your accent is shit!</font>

780
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:24,982
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you working for?</font>

781
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,137
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather die than tell you!</font>

782
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:52,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss, they're at the gate.</font>

783
01:07:53,628 --> 01:07:54,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Well let them in.</font>

784
01:07:55,494 --> 01:07:57,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, and take a stroll.
I need a little privacy.</font>

785
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:18,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Manny?</font>

786
01:08:19,382 --> 01:08:20,094
<font color=#FFFF00>Manny!?</font>

787
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:56,346
<font color=#FFFF00>Bryan.</font>

788
01:08:58,077 --> 01:09:01,065
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, God no, please!</font>

789
01:09:13,697 --> 01:09:15,597
<font color=#FFFF00>None of this is making any sense to me,
Stuart.</font>

790
01:09:17,546 --> 01:09:19,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hoping you could help me out.</font>

791
01:09:20,465 --> 01:09:21,484
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you...</font>

792
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:22,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Survive the crash?</font>

793
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,642
<font color=#FFFF00>The Russians who were following
me when I was following you</font>

794
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:31,679
<font color=#FFFF00>-They work for you, Stuart?
-No.</font>

795
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,500
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what your talking about.</font>

796
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:34,601
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you know!</font>

797
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,976
<font color=#FFFF00>The only thing I know is that
you were screwing my wife.</font>

798
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:38,603
<font color=#FFFF00>And I know that she's dead</font>

799
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:40,166
<font color=#FFFF00>No! No! Not...</font>

800
01:09:49,348 --> 01:09:50,324
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you know!</font>

801
01:09:50,337 --> 01:09:51,816
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know anything</font>

802
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:53,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I swear I don't know anything.</font>

803
01:09:53,947 --> 01:09:55,392
<font color=#FFFF00>If I believed that, we wouldn't be here!</font>

804
01:09:55,406 --> 01:09:57,136
<font color=#FFFF00>No! No! No!!!!</font>

805
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:02,870
<font color=#FFFF00>What!?</font>

806
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:04,596
<font color=#FFFF00>Malankov</font>

807
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,109
<font color=#FFFF00>Oleg Malankov</font>

808
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,863
<font color=#FFFF00>-Who is Oleg Malankov?
-I owe him money.</font>

809
01:10:09,926 --> 01:10:12,406
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know him. He will never give up.</font>

810
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Its only a game for him.</font>

811
01:10:14,872 --> 01:10:16,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost everything</font>

812
01:10:16,243 --> 01:10:18,902
<font color=#FFFF00>-He said he'd kill my family
-Why didn't you tell this to the police?</font>

813
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,422
<font color=#FFFF00>You let them think it was me.</font>

814
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,954
<font color=#FFFF00>I was angry with you God damn it. You
promised, you promised to stop seeing her.</font>

815
01:10:24,047 --> 01:10:25,039
<font color=#FFFF00>So what do you think happen?</font>

816
01:10:25,128 --> 01:10:28,124
<font color=#FFFF00>She came over to my place.
This Malankov followed her there</font>

817
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:29,854
<font color=#FFFF00>If you weren't seeing her being my back,
she wouldn't</font>

818
01:10:30,046 --> 01:10:31,579
<font color=#FFFF00>have been there in the first place,
would she?</font>

819
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,285
<font color=#FFFF00>They would have killed her someplace else.</font>

820
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:34,730
<font color=#FFFF00>So why are they coming after me?</font>

821
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:37,891
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I told them who you were</font>

822
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:40,532
<font color=#FFFF00>That you would find them and kill them.</font>

823
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:42,649
<font color=#FFFF00>How convenient would that be for you.</font>

824
01:10:43,345 --> 01:10:45,279
<font color=#FFFF00>I kill them. Your debt is canceled.</font>

825
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:47,676
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Bryan.</font>

826
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:51,630
<font color=#FFFF00>But I loved her. You gotta believe me.
I loved her, I loved her.</font>

827
01:10:52,243 --> 01:10:53,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, here's what your gonna do.</font>

828
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:56,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Your gonna go to the police
and tell them everything</font>

829
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:58,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't</font>

830
01:10:58,806 --> 01:11:02,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't. He's crazy. You don't know him.
You can do whatever you want.</font>

831
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,347
<font color=#FFFF00>Either way, I'm a dead man.</font>

832
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:07,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm dead.</font>

833
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:09,263
<font color=#FFFF00>They kill you, they don't get paid.</font>

834
01:11:09,734 --> 01:11:11,666
<font color=#FFFF00>Your not the one they're
gonna come after next.</font>

835
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:15,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Kim.</font>

836
01:11:36,628 --> 01:11:37,112
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

837
01:11:38,206 --> 01:11:39,577
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you get your keys, please?</font>

838
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:42,464
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what your
getting yourself into,</font>

839
01:11:42,657 --> 01:11:42,808
<font color=#FFFF00>man?</font>

840
01:11:42,917 --> 01:11:45,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Could
you get your keys and your phone, please?</font>

841
01:11:49,574 --> 01:11:51,797
<font color=#FFFF00>you mind putting your hand
on the steering wheel?</font>

842
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Or what?</font>

843
01:11:53,754 --> 01:11:54,717
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you gonna do? Shoot me?</font>

844
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,346
<font color=#FFFF00>Left or right?</font>

845
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:00,454
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead, put the cuffs on.</font>

846
01:12:08,519 --> 01:12:09,406
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you very much.</font>

847
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:30,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!?</font>

848
01:12:30,657 --> 01:12:31,186
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!?</font>

849
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:33,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets go Kim.</font>

850
01:12:38,037 --> 01:12:40,137
<font color=#FFFF00>-Whats going on?
-I'm keeping you safe.</font>

851
01:12:42,285 --> 01:12:43,008
<font color=#FFFF00>Sam?</font>

852
01:12:43,153 --> 01:12:43,539
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Kim.</font>

853
01:12:43,553 --> 01:12:44,515
<font color=#FFFF00>We're gonna get in the truck</font>

854
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:45,536
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi Kim!</font>

855
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:49,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets go</font>

856
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,243
<font color=#FFFF00>Dotzler</font>

857
01:12:58,321 --> 01:13:00,062
<font color=#FFFF00>Garcia and his team were
just attack by Mills!</font>

858
01:13:00,468 --> 01:13:00,792
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

859
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:03,070
<font color=#FFFF00>He took the daughter out of St. John's house.</font>

860
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:04,895
<font color=#FFFF00>Fucking sake, man!</font>

861
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:05,981
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be there right away</font>

862
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,676
<font color=#FFFF00>-Anything yet?
-No</font>

863
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:16,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing came up from the samples you gave me,
but</font>

864
01:13:17,115 --> 01:13:20,397
<font color=#FFFF00>it's gonna take a while to sort through,
Bryan. There's a shit load of data here</font>

865
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,254
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

866
01:13:22,608 --> 01:13:24,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I downloaded the police computers.</font>

867
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,456
<font color=#FFFF00>For what?</font>

868
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:28,947
<font color=#FFFF00>First thing they're going to look at are the
phone records to see if there are any clues.</font>

869
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Mine and Lenore's.</font>

870
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,222
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean what's it gonna tell ya?</font>

871
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:32,667
<font color=#FFFF00>That you and Lenore spoke to each other?</font>

872
01:13:32,797 --> 01:13:35,231
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you know what? Don't worry about it
anyway. We're almost done here anyway.</font>

873
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:37,184
<font color=#FFFF00>So what's the plan?</font>

874
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:39,298
<font color=#FFFF00>The plan is to make sure my daughter safe.</font>

875
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:41,434
<font color=#FFFF00>And the only way to do that,
so it seems, is to</font>

876
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:43,716
<font color=#FFFF00>eliminate the thing that
would make her unsafe</font>

877
01:13:44,326 --> 01:13:46,094
<font color=#FFFF00>-Malankov.
-Good one, Stuart</font>

878
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:48,643
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to help</font>

879
01:13:48,979 --> 01:13:50,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh your gonna help, alright.</font>

880
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,082
<font color=#FFFF00>Like bait helps to catch a shark</font>

881
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:53,265
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me?</font>

884
01:13:56,612 --> 01:13:57,317

<font color=#FFFF00>Oleg Malankov</font>

889
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:04,879
<font color=#FFFF00>He's as tough as they come</font>

890
01:14:06,112 --> 01:14:09,048
<font color=#FFFF00>He served in the Russian army

892
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,316
<font color=#FFFF00>It's like our Navy Seals.</font>

893
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:20,248
<font color=#FFFF00>After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
when everyone was grabbing what they could</font>

894
01:14:20,575 --> 01:14:23,371
<font color=#FFFF00>there was a real demand for
men with his kind of skills</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>He become one of the grabbers</font>

896
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,335
<font color=#FFFF00>I met him when I was doing a
deal involving heavy machinery</font>

897
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:37,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Since then, we did business in
a number of different occasions</font>

898
01:14:38,671 --> 01:14:40,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Some deals worked out</font>

899
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:44,256
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have the money</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>How can I trust you?</font>

920
01:15:51,486 --> 01:15:52,447

927
01:16:05,835 --> 01:16:06,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Malankov</font>

928
01:16:07,322 --> 01:16:09,334
<font color=#FFFF00>He works out of his penthouse apartment</font>

929
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:13,104
<font color=#FFFF00>He has a private elevator with 2 body guards</font>

930
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,640
<font color=#FFFF00>The elevators is controlled
by security upstairs.</font>

931
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:20,916
<font color=#FFFF00>Once they see who's inside
the elevator and give the OK</font>

932
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,634
<font color=#FFFF00>they'll send the elevator up</font>

933
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:28,696
<font color=#FFFF00>outside the elevator upstairs is the
security station and 3 more body guards</font>

934
01:16:29,932 --> 01:16:30,790
<font color=#FFFF00>2 sets of doors</font>

01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:34,922
<font color=#FFFF00>through the second set of doors
is Malankov's private apartment</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, can you help me out here?</font>

938
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:52,735
<font color=#FFFF00>And I got a back full of perishables.</font>

939
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:54,758
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to the first floor and ask for the desk,
alright?</font>

962
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:25,621
<font color=#FFFF00>As far as I'm concern, he's dangerous
and has to be taken into custody</font>

963
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:28,312
<font color=#FFFF00>So if you'd like, I can send a car
for you but I need you somewhere safe</font>

01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:15,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart St. John</font>

1031
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:19,722
<font color=#FFFF00>First he gets me to kill your wife, then you</font>

1032
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:24,154
<font color=#FFFF00>And then that doesn't work.
He puts you to kill me</font>

1033
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,933
<font color=#FFFF00>Either way he wins</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, Mr. Mills. It's Dotzler</font>

1093
01:31:16,455 --> 01:31:17,801
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have to piece this thing together</font>

1094
01:31:17,953 --> 01:31:19,601
<font color=#FFFF00>There's two life insurance policies</font>

1095
01:31:20,143 --> 01:31:23,112
<font color=#FFFF00>One for St. John.
One for your ex wife, you understand?</font>

1096
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:27,003
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuart owed money to these Russians.
A lot of it.</font>

1097
01:31:27,512 --> 01:31:28,348
<font color=#FFFF00>The ones who abducted her</font>

1098
01:31:28,576 --> 01:31:31,404
<font color=#FFFF00>The men then took her to my place to
kill her to keep me out of the way</font>

1099
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,384
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to step back
and allow me to handle this</font>

1100
01:31:35,394 --> 01:31:35,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I got it</font>

1101
01:31:36,518 --> 01:31:38,419
<font color=#FFFF00>What's your first priority here, inspector?</font>

1102
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:42,191
<font color=#FFFF00>To arrest St. John and charge
him with your ex wife's murder</font>

1103
01:31:43,386 --> 01:31:44,965
<font color=#FFFF00>My first priority is my daughter</font>

1104
01:32:04,313 --> 01:32:04,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of the car</font>

1105
01:32:06,152 --> 01:32:07,503
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, lets go</font>

1106
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:09,603

1109
01:32:18,035 --> 01:32:18,758
<font color=#FFFF00>-Come on, lets go.
-Yes, sir.</font>

1110
01:32:25,701 --> 01:32:27,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Requesting clear for take off</font>

1111
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,694
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, guys. Come on, lets go</font>

1112
01:32:28,712 --> 01:32:29,965
<font color=#FFFF00>Requesting permission for take off</font>

1113
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,811
<font color=#FFFF00>We got a visual on the Porsche</font>

1114
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,587
<font color=#FFFF00>He's heading to Santa Monica Airport</font>

1115
01:32:41,611 --> 01:32:43,687
<font color=#FFFF00>I want all units in the
area of the Santa Monica</font>

1116
01:32:43,866 --> 01:32:46,287
<font color=#FFFF00>airport to be on the look
out for a black Porsche</font>

1117
01:32:55,192 --> 01:32:56,320
<font color=#FFFF00>89-90</font>

1118
01:33:06,464 --> 01:33:06,851
<font color=#FFFF00>No</font>

1119
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:15,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Lets go, lets go!</font>

1120
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:24,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on!</font>

1121
01:33:26,841 --> 01:33:27,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Go!</font>

1122
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me the God damn gun!</font>

1123
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:53,446
<font color=#FFFF00>Shoot you in the head!</font>

1124
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:55,181
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut up!</font>

1125
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Very smart.</font>

1126
01:34:13,853 --> 01:34:15,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Played me off against the Russians</font>

1127
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:18,424
<font color=#FFFF00>Coming over for coffee</font>

1128
01:34:19,044 --> 01:34:21,435
<font color=#FFFF00>Taking my phone, sending text,
and then erasing them!</font>

1129
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:31,385
<font color=#FFFF00>So that your pals could plant Lenore's
body and make it look as if I killed her</font>

1130
01:34:38,596 --> 01:34:39,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Well your problem solved</font>

1131
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:42,013
<font color=#FFFF00>All your worries over</font>

1132
01:34:42,228 --> 01:34:44,487
<font color=#FFFF00>But it didn't quit work out that way</font>

1133
01:34:46,923 --> 01:34:47,686
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, Bryan</font>

1134
01:34:48,906 --> 01:34:49,651
<font color=#FFFF00>They're coming</font>

1135
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't kill me now</font>

1136
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:58,158
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh yeah?</font>

1137
01:35:00,576 --> 01:35:00,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

1138
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:08,296
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you know alot of people</font>

1139
01:35:09,113 --> 01:35:11,908
<font color=#FFFF00>and with a good lawyer you'll
get out of jail in a few years</font>

1140
01:35:12,191 --> 01:35:13,560
<font color=#FFFF00>and then I'll come for you</font>

1141
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:15,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll find you</font>

1142
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,112
<font color=#FFFF00>And we both know what's gonna happen</font>

1143
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:05,958
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew from the beginning</font>

1144
01:36:08,693 --> 01:36:09,522
<font color=#FFFF00>It was the bagels</font>

1145
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:11,553
<font color=#FFFF00>They were warm</font>

1146
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:14,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean I had to ask myself what kind of guy</font>

1147
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:17,442
<font color=#FFFF00>goes out for warm bagels</font>

1148
01:36:17,784 --> 01:36:19,546
<font color=#FFFF00>and comes back and commits a murder?</font>

1149
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:22,081
<font color=#FFFF00>So, I compared</font>

1150
01:36:22,325 --> 01:36:24,297
<font color=#FFFF00>the time stamps to the deleted texts</font>

1151
01:36:24,751 --> 01:36:26,713
<font color=#FFFF00>That you downloaded from our computers</font>

1152
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:29,186
<font color=#FFFF00>which by the way is illegal</font>

1153
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:30,616
<font color=#FFFF00>and we could arrest you for it</font>

1154
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:31,363
<font color=#FFFF00>either way, I could</font>

1155
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:33,319
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's got me</font>

1156
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,165
<font color=#FFFF00>and I was able to figure it out</font>

1157
01:36:37,135 --> 01:36:38,032
<font color=#FFFF00>She was leaving him</font>

1158
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,880
<font color=#FFFF00>He needed the insurance money to pay Malankov</font>

1159
01:36:42,449 --> 01:36:44,245
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't help us out by escaping you</font>

1160
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:49,438
<font color=#FFFF00>You figured what better way to get rid
of Malankov and keep the insurance money</font>

1161
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>than by getting me the kill
the guy who would kill him</font>

1162
01:36:53,987 --> 01:36:56,216
<font color=#FFFF00>because it was the only way
to keep my daughter safe</font>

1163
01:36:58,311 --> 01:36:59,191
<font color=#FFFF00>It almost worked</font>

1164
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:00,913
<font color=#FFFF00>Almost</font>

1165
01:37:03,588 --> 01:37:06,055
<font color=#FFFF00>So, are we done, Inspector?</font>

1166
01:37:07,961 --> 01:37:08,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Course</font>

1167
01:37:09,802 --> 01:37:10,751
<font color=#FFFF00>course</font>

1168
01:37:14,646 --> 01:37:15,399
<font color=#FFFF00>We're done</font>

1169
01:37:17,951 --> 01:37:20,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Could you um,
just stay in town for the next month or</font>

1170
01:37:20,387 --> 01:37:22,717
<font color=#FFFF00>so. Just in case I have a
few other questions for you</font>

1171
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:24,384
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

1172
01:37:57,499 --> 01:37:58,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you two</font>

1173
01:37:58,844 --> 01:38:00,344
<font color=#FFFF00>I've though about this all night</font>
