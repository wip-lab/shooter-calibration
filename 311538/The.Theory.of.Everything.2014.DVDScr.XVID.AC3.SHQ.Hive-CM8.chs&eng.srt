快点  老头子
Come on, old man.

再不快点就晚了
I think we're going to be late!

9
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,670
我全速前进呢  布莱恩
Fire's on the rocket, Brian.

10

布莱恩找到了空隙
Brian finds an opening!

11
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,300
别搞砸了
Oy, don't mess up!

12
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,210
霍金的最后冲刺
Hawking's last minute!

13
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
谢了  布莱恩
Thanks, Brian!

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,340
太慢了  老头子
Too slow, old man.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,570
太慢了
Too slow.

16
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,970
我第一个喝到酒  你好啊
First to find a drink, yeah. Hello.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,360
要是宇宙的奥秘跟性有关
What if the secret of the universe has something to do with sex.

18
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,370
你博士论文就写这个吧  爱之物理学
Maybe do your doctorate on that? The physics of love.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,070
-那是你的研究领域吧  -最近没怎么研究了
- I think that's more your field, Brian. - Not lately.

20
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,940
你要是再定不下来  就要被请出去了
They will boot you out, you know, if you don't decide.

21
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,620
我认识这里所有的...棒极了
I know everybody here who's... brilliant.

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,560
居然是科学家们
Oh, dear, scientists!

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,090
别担心  不会待太久的
Don't worry, we don't have to stay long...

24
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,600
简直无聊到死
looks mortifyingly dull.

25
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,270
-没劲  -那是谁
- Bores. - Who's that?

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,050
哪个  他吗
Who's who? Oh, him?

27
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,300
他可怪了  不过他也去了抗议核游行[1960年代]
He's strange. However, he goes to ban the bomb marches.

-英语  -法语及西班牙语
- English. - French and Spanish.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,870
那你呢  你学什么的
What about you? What are you?

35
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,200
-宇宙学家  我是个宇宙学家  -那是什么
- Cosmologist, I'm a cosmologist. - What's that?

36
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,160
就是特别聪明的  不信上帝的人
It's a kind of religion for

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,940
-信的宗教  -聪明的不信上帝的
- intelligent atheists. - Intelligent atheists?

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,140
你不信教吧
You're not religious, are you?

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,640
国教
C. Of E.

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
-就是英国国教[圣公会]  -是啊
- Church of England. - England, yes.

41
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,270
总得有个信教的
I suppose someone has to be.

42
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,270
那宇宙学家信奉什么呢
So, what do cosmologists worship then?

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,740
信奉什么
What do we worship?

44
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,430
用一个统一的方程
One single unifying equation

45
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,660
来解释宇宙万物
that explains everything in the universe.

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,170
-是吗  -是
- Really. - Yes.

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,400
是什么方程
What's the equation?

48
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,040
问题就在这
That is the question.

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,840
这个问题非常好  我还没想出来
And a very good question. I'm not quite sure yet.

50
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,000
但我想研究这个
But I intend to find out.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,840
那你为什么去牛津啊
Then why do you even stay at Oxford?

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,970
因为我的期末考试
Because my finals exams are such a

53
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,440
考得一塌糊涂  他们叫我参加个口试
shambles that the examiners they settled me in for a "Viva",

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,600
-他们如果我拿到二等  -口试是什么
- And they told me that if I go up a second... - What's a "Viva"?

55
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,820
有点恐怖  跟人面对面坐下来什么的
A sort of, mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,570
-面试吗  -审讯吧
- As an interview? - An interrogation.

57
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,650
我告诉他们  如果给我二等学位[参考片尾注释]
And I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree

58
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,270
我就得留在牛津做研究
then I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford,

59
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,570
如果给我一等学位  我就能去剑桥了
but if they gave me the 1st, I needed to get into Cambridge, then

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,070
他们就能永远甩掉我了
they would never have to see me again.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,360
-所以他们给了你一等  -没错
- They gave you the 1st. - They gave me the 1st.

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460
-是啊  -派对已经正式结束了
- Of course. - This party is officially deceased.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,970
来吧  我找辆车送你回家
Come on, I've fixed you up a ride home.

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,990
走啊  简  简
Come on, Jane... Jane?

65
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,770
-跟你聊天很开心  -我也是
- Well, it was lovely to talk to you. - Yes.

66
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,870
还有  希望你能找到那个方程
And... I hope you find your equation.

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,530
是啊
Yes... oh...

68
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,820
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - G'bye.

69
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,700

来看看这个
Well, then, here we are,

72
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,310
给你们的小测试
a little challenge for you all,

73
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,760
在你们的学术研究路上...
as you embark upon your separate doctoral journeys...

74
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,870
不管你们打算研究什么  霍金先生
whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking.

75
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
传下去
Pass them down.

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,170
来看看你们是男人还是男孩
Something to separate the men from the boys,

77
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,380
是粮食还是糟糠
the wheat from the chaff,

78
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,980
介子还是π介子  真夸克[基本粒子之一]还是假行家
the mesons from the pi-mesons, the quarks from the quacks.

79
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,850
十个问题  一个比一个难
Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last.

80
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,300
祝你们好运吧  周五三点再见
Good luck, you'll need it. Shall we say Friday at 3 o'clock?

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,910
我要做到瘫痪了
This is going to hospitalize me.

82
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,450
好了  划  划  划  划
All right! Row! Row! Row! Row!

83
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,150
使劲划  布莱恩  加油啊
Row it out, Brian! Come on, Brian!

84
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,740
划  布莱恩  加油
Row, Brian! Come on! Row, Brian.

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,230
向前进  布莱恩
Straight on, Brian!

86
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,100
再来两杯这个
Can I get two more of those, please?

87
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,740
-换点零钱打个电话  -好的
- And some change for phone, Sir. - Yeah.

88
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,640
-不拿走吗  -简
- Take her out, man. - Jane.

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,770
猜我那天碰到谁了  卡罗琳
You'll never guess who I saw the other day... Caroline.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,340
她好像有男朋友了  不过她爱约谁约谁
I think she was having a date, she can have him, quite frankly.

91
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,730
这概率有多大
What's the probability?

92
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,250
小的不得了
Reasonably low.

93
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,100
这个  这是斯蒂芬
Uh... this is... this is Stephen.

94
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,360
-你玩槌球吗  -槌球
- Do you play croquet? - Croquet?

95
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,430
-有阵子没玩了  -周日早上
- Not recently. - Sunday morning.

96
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,670
我周日早上有事
I'm actually busy on Sunday mornings.

97
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,920
是啊  跟上帝[做礼拜]
Oh... Him.

98
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,960
好吧
Okay.

99
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,680
快起床  你做出了几个
Oh, come on, get up! How many did you get?

100
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,400
-早上好  布莱恩  -下午好  斯蒂芬
- Morning, Brian. - Good afternoon, Stephen.

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,620
那几个问题你做出几个
How many of the possible questions did you do?

102
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,800
布莱恩  你在说什么啊
Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about.

103
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,270
夏玛的问题  你做出几个  斯蒂芬
How many of Sciama's questions did you get, Stephen?

104
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,640
-没做  -一个没做吗
- None. - You didn't get any?

105
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
我一会再做
I was going to do them later.

106
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,220
你看都没看
You haven't even looked at them.

107
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
没看
No.

108
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,900
斯蒂芬  你知道自己
Stephen, are you aware that

109
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,090
是自愿攻读物理学博士学位的吧
you've voluntarily embarked on a PhD in physics?

110
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,570
还是在英国最顶尖的大学里
At the most prestigious college in England?

111
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,320
知道
Yes.

112
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,140
还以为入学典礼时候你睡着了呢
Oh! Thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something.

113
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,640
布莱恩
Brian?

114
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,490
-怎么了  -放段瓦格纳吧
- What? - Can you whip on some Wagner?

115
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,330
一边去
Sod off!

116
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,140
-请进  斯蒂芬  -抱歉
- Come in, Stephen. - Sorry.

117
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,480
迈克  你这乱成一坨
Michael, that's so illegible

118
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,060
我也不知道你错了多少  估计是不少
I can't quite decipher how wrong it is, I suspect enormously,

119
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,280
布莱恩  看不懂你写的什么
and Brian... that's just baffling.

120
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,690
-您受累做了没  -抱歉
- Have you even bothered to? - Oh, sorry.

121
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,000
列车时刻表
Train time tables.

122
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,540
这怎么行  这时刻表都过期了
It's certainly unacceptable, these expired a month ago.

123
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,920
在背面  我出了点事
It's on the back, I had a little accident.

124
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,650
只能做出九个
I could only do nine.

125
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,010
好吧  谢天谢地  那个
Well... oh... thank God... however...

126
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,380
九个
Nine?

127
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,450
请进
Come in.

128
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,000
斯蒂芬  坐吧
Oh, Stephen, take a seat.

129
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,750
我想谈谈你的课题
I wanted to talk to you about your subject.

130
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,660
我们都等着你决定研究方向呢
We're all rather concerned as to what it's going to be.

131
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,230
我定不下来
I can't decide.

132
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,790
有什么想法吗
Do you have any ideas?

133
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,010
没有
No.

134
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,670
汤普森在这发现了电子[1897年]
This is where J.J. Thomson discovered the electron,

135
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,290
卢瑟福在这分裂了原子核[1909年]
and where Rutherford split the atom.

136
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,990
在剑桥搞研究的好处就是  你永远都不知道
You know, one of the great rewards of this job is one never knows

137
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,710
谁  在哪里
from where the next great

138
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,600
能搞出个重大发现来
leap forward is going to come, or from whom.

139
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,530
下周五  我要带几个优秀研究生去伦敦
Next Friday, I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London,

140
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,600
参加数学家罗杰·彭罗斯的讲座
to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose.

141
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,690
你也来吧  如果有兴趣的话
You come along... if you're interested.

142
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,120
走的时候记得关门
Oh, and close the door as you leave.

143
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,660
听说你从没去过教堂
So, I gather you've never been to church?

144
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,460
-很久以前去过  -想信教吗
- Once upon a time. - Tempted to convert?

145
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,800
我不太信这种统领万物的神
I have a slight problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise.

146
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,090
你午饭有安排吗  我妈烤的肉特别好吃
Now, what are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast.

147
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,810
简  你是学什么的
So, Jane, what are you studying?

148
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
-文学  -要球甘蓝吗
- Arts. - Sprouts?

149
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
谢谢
Thank you.

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,390
法语和西班牙语  毕业希望继续读博
French and Spanish, and hoping to do a PhD eventually.

151
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,010
哪个方向呢
Oh, one arm.

152
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,840
中世纪伊波利亚半岛诗歌
Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula.

153
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,590
中世纪诗歌...你喜欢哪位画家
Medieval poets... What painters do you like?

154
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,600
-我喜欢特纳  -特纳吗
- Well, I like Turner. - Turner, really?

155
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,530
我一直觉得他的画
You know, I always feel that his

156
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,400
像是被暴雨泡了好几天
paintings look as if they've been left out in the rain.

157
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,690
还有  威廉·布雷克
And... William Blake.

158
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,030
-简  来尝尝我的接骨木酒  -谢谢
- Jane, have some of my elderflower wine. - Yes, yes, thank you.

159
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,050
别试  别试  简
Don't touch it, don't touch it, Jane.

160
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,330
谢谢  他妈呢
Thank you. Mother.

161
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,500
斯蒂芬不喜欢我自己酿的酒  菲丽西汀呢
Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine...Philistine.

162
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,720
给你塞几瓶带回学校
I'm going to send you back with a couple of bottles.

163
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,000
斯蒂芬  你和这位善良的女士去了教堂
So, Stephen, you have come to church with a good woman.

164
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,090
觉得自己圣洁吗
Are you feeling holier than thou?

165
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,960
非常圣洁  谢谢
Positively saintly... thank you.

166
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,200
你还没说自己为什么不信上帝
You haven't said why you don't believe in God.

167
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
物理学家的研究
A physicist can't allow his calculations

168
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
不能受超自然的创世主影响
to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.

169
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,420
你说得像是在指责物理学家啊
Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists.

170
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,810
鸡胸还是鸡腿
Light or dark?

171
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,330
-简  鸡胸还是鸡腿  -鸡胸  谢谢
- Jane, light meat or dark? - Light, please.

172
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,750
我要请简做我五月舞会[剑桥传统]的舞伴
I'm inviting Jane to be my partner for the May ball.

173
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,990
真的吗  真棒
Really! Very impressive!

174
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,720
你要跳舞了  斯蒂芬
You'll have to dance, won't you, Stephen?

175
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,970
给女仆让个路  好了
Make way for my mother's maid, here we go.

176
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,560
你好
Hello.

177
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,510
你好
Hello.

178
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,660
-抱歉  -你没事吧
- Sorry. - Are you okay?

179
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,870
-跳舞吧  -不跳
- Should we dance? - No.

180
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,870
不跳了
No.

181
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,770
我不跳  虽然我很喜欢看别人跳
I don't. It's a phenomenon I'm very happy to observe,

182
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,090
但我自己是不会跳的
but I can't possibly imagine participating.

183
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,330
我也这么想的  谁愿意跳舞啊
I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance?

184
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,490
说真的  我不跳舞
No, I'm serious, I don't dance.

185
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,390
那就不跳了
No dancing then.

186
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,310
你看男生的衬衫前胸
Do you see how the men's shirt-fronts

187
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,820
还有领结  比女生的礼服还闪亮
and their bow ties how they glow more than the womens' dresses?

188
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,800
-是啊  -知道为什么吗
- Yes. - Do you know why?

189
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,840
-为什么  -汰渍
- Why? - Tide.

190
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,540
洗衣粉
Washing powder.

191
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,380
洗衣粉里的荧光物质在紫外线照射下发光
The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light.

192
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,080
你怎么知道的
Why do you know that?

193
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,320
恒星诞生和毁灭时  会辐射出紫外线
When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation.

194
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,070
如果只能看到夜空里的紫外线
So, if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light,

195
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,940
现在的星星就都不见了
then almost all the stars would disappear

196
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,640
只剩下恒星壮丽的诞生和毁灭
and all that we would see are these spectacular births and deaths.

197
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,460
-我觉得应该...  -就像这个
- And I reckon it would look a little... - Like that.

198
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,390
-为什么  -什么为什么
- So, why? - Why what?

199
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,860
为什么要研究中世纪西班牙诗歌
Why Spanish medieval poetry?

200
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,770
应该是我喜欢穿越时空吧...
I suppose I like to time travel...

201
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,210
...像你一样
...like you.

202
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,240
有哪段时空是你特别想去的吗
Are there any particular time periods that you'd like to visit?

203
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,860
-二十年代吧  -咆哮的二十年代吗[1920  北美]
- The imagine it's the Twenties. - The Roaring Twenties?

204
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:41,730
{\an8}耶茨  《The Song of the Happy Shepherd》

205
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,060
"不要在天文学家那找寻知识
"Seek, then, No learning from starry men,

206
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,650
"他们只是用望远镜
"Who follow with the optic glass

207
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,730
"追随恒星纷飞的路径"
"The whirling ways of stars that pass."

208
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,280
真棒
Bravo!

209
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:28,250
"创世之初  只有天地
"In the beginning was the heaven and the earth,

210
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,330
大地混沌  没有定型"
and the earth was without form,"

211
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,300
"黑暗笼罩着深渊"
"And darkness was upon the face of the deep."

212
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,480
和我共舞一曲吧
Would you dance with me?

213
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,110
三号站台  前往伦敦国王十字车站的列车
The train now departing from track number three is

214
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,350
将于九点十五发车
the nine-fifteen service to London King's Cross.

215
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,580
快点  斯蒂芬  快点
Come on, Stephen. Get a move on.

216
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,320
怎么了你  快上来
What's wrong with you, man? Come up top.

217
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,640
一颗恒星  体积是太阳的三倍多
A star, more than three times the size of our sun...

218
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,010
就要走到尽头  怎么结束呢  坍落
ought to end its life, how? With a collapse.

219
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,220
整颗恒星的引力
The gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming

220
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,520
克服了原子之间的斥力
the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms,

221
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,320
向内坍落
and so collapsing inwards.

222
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,440
如果质量足够大  还会继续坍落
If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse,

223
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,240
形成一个黑洞  翘曲了时空
creating a black hole, where the warping of space-time

224
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,080
什么都逃不出去  包括光
is so great that nothing can escape... not even light.

225
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,600
变得越来越小  越小
It gets... smaller... smaller.

226
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,230
恒星的密度越来越大
The star, in fact, gets denser

227
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,180
原子  甚至原子内的粒子都被压缩了
as atoms, even subatomic particles get literally crushed into smaller and smaller space.

228
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,400
那最终  我们得到了什么
And at its end point what are we left with?

229
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,550
时空奇点
A space time singularity.

230
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,920
时空在这里停止
Space and time come to a stop.

231
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,970
我在想  如果把彭罗斯的理论
I wonder what would happen if you applied

232
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,780
从黑洞推广到整个宇宙呢
Penrose's theory about black holes to the entire universe?

233
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,730
如果爱因斯坦是对的
If Einstein is right,

234
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,750
或者说广义相对论是对的  那宇宙是在膨胀的
or if general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes?

235
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,020
对吧
Yes?

236
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,170
-对  -好了
- Yes. - Okay, so...

237
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,840
如果时光倒流  宇宙就是在缩小
If you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller.

238
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,350
-没错  -那么
- All right. - So...

239
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,310
如果一路倒退回去
What if I reverse the process all the way

240
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,420
回到时间的起点呢
back to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself?

241
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,020
-时间的起点  -对
- The beginning of Time itself? - Yes.

242
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,590
宇宙越来越小
The universe, getting smaller and smaller,

243
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,450
密度越来越大  温度越来越高
getting denser and denser, hotter and hotter as...

244
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,970
随着时间的倒流
As you wind back the clock.

245
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,330
-没错  时光倒流  -时光倒流
- Exactly, you wind back the clock. - Wind back the clock.

246
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,880
你是想让时光倒流吗[逆时针]
Is that what you're doing? You're winding back the clock.

247
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,450
没错
Exactly what I'm doing.

248
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,100
继续转  还有好久呢  继续转
Well, keep winding! You've got quite a way to go! Keep winding.

249
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,050
我怕摔倒
I don't want to fall down.

250
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,260
你得回到时间的起点
Well, you've got to go back to the beginning of time.

251
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,570
可有你转的  接着转  别停
You've got a long way to go, so, keep winding, keep winding!

252
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,150
直到...
Until you get...

253
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,840
奇点
A singularity.

254
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,250
时空奇点
A space-time singularity,

255
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,870
宇宙源自黑洞的爆炸
so the universe born from a black hole exploding.

256
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,620
-继续  -继续什么
- Keep going. - What do you mean, "Keep going", what...

257
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,150
宇宙起源之前吗
before the universe began?

258
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
不是  继续  用数学来解决
No, no, no, no! Keep going, develop the mathematics!

259
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,710
用力顶  用力顶
Push it as hard as you can! Push it, push it!

260
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,570
-用力  -我用力了
- As hard as you can. - I am pushing as hard as I can.

261
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:04,350
怎么...  一  二  一  二
What... I count 1... 1, 2... 1, 2...

262
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
好了
All right, all right.

263
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,800
无名指  第四个夹子
Fourth finger, fourth peg.

264
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,380
是运动神经元病
It's called motor neuron disease.

265
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,280
神经元逐步失调
It's a progressive neurological disorder

266
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,940
导致控制肌肉运动的脑细胞受损
that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity,

267
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,510
比如
such as...

268
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,660
讲话  行走  呼吸  吞咽
Speaking, walking, breathing, swallowing

269
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,420
控制肌肉运动的电信号收到了干扰
The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted.

270
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,440
结果就是肌肉逐步萎缩
The result is... gradual muscle decay, wasting away.

271
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,020
最终  丧失
Eventually, the ability to

272
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,150
运动能力  彻底地
control voluntary movement is... lost... entirely.

273
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,750
平均寿命是发病后两年
I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years.

274
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,770
我也无能为力
There's nothing I can do for you.

275
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,860
大脑呢
What about the brain?

276
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,140
大脑不受影响  你的思想依然在
The brain isn't affected, you're thoughts won't change.

277
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,900
就是
It's... just that...

278
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,030
到最后  没人能知道你在想什么了
Well, eventually, no one will know what they are.

279
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,570
非常抱歉
I'm ever so sorry.

280
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,860
欢迎收看本周的自然世界
Well, welcome to this week's episode of "The Natural World",

281
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,900
这次  我们将一起探索剑桥一位杰出物理学家
where this week we explore the bizarre hibernation patterns

282
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,640
他的冬眠规律
of the rare Cambridge Physicist,

283
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,860
就是盛装的这位
seen here in his remarkable plumage..."

284
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,840
怎么样  他们怎么说的  你的手腕怎么样
So, how was it? What did they say, how's your wrist?

285
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,940
我病了  布莱恩
I have a disease, Bri.

286
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,900
是花柳病吗  斯蒂芬
Is it venereal... Stephen?

287
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,800
是运动神经元病
I have motor neuron disease.

288
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,970
不好意思
Sorry, I don't...

289
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,210
卢·葛雷克病  他是个棒球运动员
It's Lou Gehrig's disease, he's a baseball player.

290
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,560
不好意思  神经运动  棒球什么的病
Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering research into

291
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,670
我还没深入研究过
skilled motor, baseball related diseases.

292
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,390
-我还剩两年  -什么
- I have two years to live. - Sorry?

293
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,110
大声说出来就不那么怪了是吧
It does sound odd when you say it out loud, doesn't it?

294
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,740
什么意思  你干什么
Whatchya mean? What are you doing?

295
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,190
他们  他们
What did... what did... what...

296
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,490
他们怎么说的  我刚没仔细...
what did they say? Sorry, I... I don't really...

297
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,760
走吧  布莱恩
Will you go, Brian?

298
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,740
斯蒂芬  是我太蠢了
Stephen, I was just being a berk...

299
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,510
我没...我肯定...
I didn't... I'm so... I'll be...

300
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,490
走吧
You go.

301
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,860
斯蒂芬  找你的电话  是个姑娘
Stephen, phone for you. It's a girl.

302
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,130
-回头见  好的
- I'll see you soon. - Yes.

303
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,330
她在等着呢
She's waiting.

304
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

305
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,290

306
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,500
真抱歉  我
I'm sorry... I'm...

307
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,460
你坐下吧
Why don't you sit down.

308
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,650
真抱歉  是斯蒂芬的事
I'm so sorry. It's about Stephen.

309
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,910
他之前住院...
You know he was in hospital...

310
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,900
有教育意义吗
Something educational?

311
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,380
非常有
Very.

312
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,840
约翰跟玛莎有外遇
John is having an affair with Martha,

313
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,610
可玛莎爱着阿兰
but Martha is in love with Alan,

314
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,810
不过阿兰应该是同性恋
and I think that Alan is probably homosexual,

315
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,380
看他的毛衣  我呢  我在尽力
by the look of his jumper, so, well, I'm just trying

316
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,080
计算他们幸福的可能性
to work out the mathematical probability of happiness.

317
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,760
要算出来了吗
Are you close?

318
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,620
应该是零点几  不过还差着远呢
It's some integer of zero, but, no, I'm not quite there yet.

319
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,310
-斯蒂芬  -他刚走
- Stephen. - You just missed him.

320
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,170
之前还在这
He was here earlier.

321
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,490
别这样
Don't do this.

322
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,780
走吧
Go!

323
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,990
好吧
Okay.

324
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,290
跟我玩个游戏
Play a game with me.

325
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,010
快走
Go!

326
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,420
你要是不站起来跟我打一场
If you don't get up and play a game with me...

327
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,340
我就不回来了
I won't come back here again...

328
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,550
永远不来了
...ever.

329
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,740
来吧
Come on!

330
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,700
你走吧
You can leave me now.

331
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,490
你不想谈谈吗
Are you going to talk about this or not?

332
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,240
-快走不好吗  -你想要我走吗
- Will you please just go? - Is that what you want?

333
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,100
是  我想要你走  走吧
Yes, it is what I want, so, please,

334
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,530
你要是还在乎我  就走吧
if you care about me all, then, please, just go!

335
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,790
-不行  -我只剩两年了
- I can't. - I have two years to live.

336
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,940
-我还要工作  -我爱你
- I need to work. - I love you.

337
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,970
你这  你得出了错误结论
You've... you've leapt to... that's a false conclusion...

338
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,430
我要和你在一起  有多就是多久
I want us to be together, for as long as we've got,

339
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,920
时间不长的话
and if that's not very long then, well,

340
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,260
也没事  两年也够
that's just how it is... it'll have to do.

341
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,560
你不知道会怎么样  我的一切都受影响
You don't know what's coming. It'll affect everything.

342
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,040
你眼镜总是这么脏
Your glasses are always dirty.

343
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
给你
There.

344
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,290
好多了吧
That's better, isn't it?

345
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,470
嗯
Yes.

346
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,510
是啊
Yes, it is.

347
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,710
...在盒子边缘
...the solutions to the Schrodinger

348
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,400
薛定谔方程是无解的  所以...
equation must vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have...

349
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,960
时间
Time!

350
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,260
你的课题是时间吗
Time, that's your subject?

351
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,660
有具体方向吗
Any aspect in particular?

352
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,040
就是时间
Time.

353
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
请进  请进
Come in, come in.

354
00:36:54,050 --> 00:37:00,350
你应该不知道自己面对的是什么  简
I don't think you realize what lies ahead, Jane.

355
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,850
他的寿命非常短
His life is going to be very short.

356
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:13,080
要小心  你是在和科学作对
So, be careful, the weight of science is against you.

357
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,510
而且你没有抗争的机会
And this will not be a fight, Jane.

358
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,900
我们都会被打败
This is going to be a very heavy defeat...

359
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,080
...所有人
...for all of us.

360
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
我知道你们都怎么想
I know what you all think... that...

361
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,480
觉得我不是很坚强
That I don't look a terribly strong person.

362
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,760
可我爱他
But I love him.

363
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,650
他也爱我
And he loves me.

364
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,440
我们要一起抗争...
We're going to fight this illness together...

365
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,050
...大家一起
...all of us.

366
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,710
祝你好运
Good luck.

367
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,880
-早上好  斯蒂芬  -早上好  雷夫
- Good morning, Stephen. - Good morning, Rev.

368
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,660
我知道  我知道
I know, I know...

369
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,830
-...方程要更优雅一点  -是啊
- ...got to be a little more elegant. - Yes, that's what...

370
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,570
我懂...
I understand...

371
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,590
进来吧  斯蒂芬
Come in, Stephen.

372
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,600
我知道  一开始都担心这个
I know it's something we're all worried about initially.

373
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,850
你保留了些意见...
You had some reservations about it...

374
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,090
等着瞧吧
Well, well, we'll see.

375
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,110
-欢迎  斯蒂芬  -早上好
- Welcome, Stephen. - Morning.

376
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,010
-请坐吧  -不用  谢谢
- Would you like to take a seat? - No, I'm fine, thank you.

377
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,410
确定吗
You're sure?

378
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,500
好吧  总体来说
So, so you... in summary.

379
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,370
第一章  漏洞百出
As we know, chapter one, full of holes.

380
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,130
缺乏数理支持
Lacks mathematical support.

381
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,590
-基普·索恩教授  -第二章  原创的
- Professor Thorne. - Chapter Two, now, really original.

382
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,630
用了不少罗杰的观点
Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

383
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,010
至少你还支持我的观点
Well, at least you run with them.

384
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,790
第三章  留了太多疑问
Chapter three, too many unanswered questions.

385
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,980
没错
I agree.

386
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,830
当然了  还有第四章
And then, of course, we have chapter four,

387
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,960
时间起点的黑洞
this black hole at the beginning of time.

388
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,200
-时空奇点  -没错
- Space-time singularity? - Indeed.

389
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,190
太棒了
It's brilliant!

390
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,090
太棒了
Brilliant.

391
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,620
棒极了
Superb!

392
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,040
那么只剩下一句话了  做得不错
And therefore, all that remains to be said is: Well done!

393
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,360
或者准确点说
Or perhaps, I should say, to be more precise:

394
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,220
-做的不错  博士  -漂亮  斯蒂芬
- Well done, Doctor! - Bravo, Stephen.

395
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,090
这理论真不错
An extraordinary theory.

396
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,280
谢谢
Thank you.

397
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,690
-然后呢  -证明它
- So what next? - Prove it.

398
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,690
用一个方程证明  时间是有起点的
To prove, with a single equation, that time had a beginning.

399
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,360
是不是很棒  教授
Wouldn't that be nice, Professor?

400
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,630
一个简单  优美的方程
With one simple elegant equation

401
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,930
来解释万物
to explain everything?

402
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,250
是啊  肯定很棒
Yes, it would. It would indeed.

403
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,560
受人尊敬的  能力超群的
The esteemed, and formidable...

404
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,360
-博士  -谁[神秘博士]
- Doctor. - Who?

405
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,860
斯蒂芬·霍金博士
Doctor Stephen Hawking.

406
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,780
敬斯蒂芬·霍金
To Stephen Hawking.

407
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,280
谢谢  简
Thank you, Jane.

408
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,830
真神奇  他是第一个担心自己努力不够
It is astonishing that he's the first person

409
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,250
还能拿到博士学位的人
to receive his doctorate fearing what little work he's be doing.

410
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,110
努力是霍金最讨厌的词
"Work" Was the worst four-letter word for Stephen.

411
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,550
甚至在牛津
Even at Oxford,

412
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,660
他平均每天只学习一个小时  一个小时
especially, he averaged an hour, an HOUR a day he averaged.

413
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,660
-就这样  斯蒂芬就是...  -真是神奇  我一开始...
- And that it is. It's Stephen... - It's astonishing that...

414
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,400
过去六个月
And how many of your

415
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,120
我帮你们回了多少信
letters have I covered in the last six months?

416
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,500
你们外出搞研究时候
When you've been doing research trips...

417
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,590
-多少  -四封
- How many? - Four.

418
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,400
-没事吧  -没事  我没事
- Everything all right? - I'm good... I'm fine.

419
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,100
你好啊  罗宾
Hi, Robin.

420
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,100
我没事
It's ok. I'm all right.

00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,780
告诉布莱恩
Tell Brian.

423
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,390
好啊
Of course.

424
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,850
方便吃早饭了
Well, it's convenient for breakfast!

425
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,890
谢谢
Thank you.

426
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,700
你刚说什么了
Sorry, did you say something?

427
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,380
我说...
I said...

428
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,270
什么
Yes?

429
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,690

马上回来
I'll be one second.

433
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,510
露丝  宝贝
Luce, Baby.

434
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,520
简
Jane.

435
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,780
斯蒂芬
Stephen.

436
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,930
亲爱的
Dear?

437
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,430
我有了个想法
I've got an idea.

438
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,770
我说我有了个想法
I said I've had an idea.

439
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,060
-你好  -你好  丹尼斯

443
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,570
-抱歉  没关系

444
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,060

445
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:02,650
有些粒子  是可以逃离黑洞的
some particles can in fact escape a black hole.

446
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:08,140
黑洞  并不是那么黑的
The black holes are not, in fact, black at all,

447
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,130
它散发着热辐射
but glow with heat radiation.

448
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,910
...也就是说
...the steady emission of

449
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,010
黑洞在稳定地辐射热能  损失质量
heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass,

450
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:32,710
最终以爆炸的方式消失
and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion.

451
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,500
非常  非常简单  物体散发热量
It's very, very simple, when a hot body loses heat...

452
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,320
热力学第二定理
Second law of thermodynamics.

453
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,270
-没错  热力学  -就在...
- He's right, it's thermodynamics. - In... in...

454
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,620
想象一下  如果的确
If we can imagine that the black hole is, indeed,

455
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,980
有粒子不断逃离黑洞
losing particles, then,

456
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,350
那假以时日  黑洞的体积就会减小  会蒸发
over time it will diminish in size, it will evaporate.

457
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,240
-然后  -消失
- It will... - Disappear.

458
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,110
所以
So...

459
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:03,900
首先  恒星消失  坍落成黑洞
First a star vanishes into a black hole,

460
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:12,450
然后  黑洞也要...
but then the black hole itself must...

461
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,890
消失  虚无
Gone! Nothing!

462
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,520
-从虚无到虚无  -你欠我杯啤酒
- From nothing to nothing. - You owe me another beer.

463
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,750
我得告诉你
I have to show you that our

464
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,960
我们的朋友证明了时间是有起点的
friend has proven that time, indeed has a beginning.

465
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,990
不仅是这个  还有宇宙如何出现  如何消亡
Not only that, how the universe was born, and how it will end.

466
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,550
-砰  -咔嚓
- Bang! - Crunch!

467
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,390
多美  多生动
It's beautiful! It's racy!

468
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:41,410
真荒唐  胡言乱语
Complete nonsense. It's preposterous.

469
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,940
是因为我说的东西吗  教授
Was it something I said, Professor?

470
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,890
抱歉
Excuse me.

477
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,150
说实话...
To be honest...

478

479

480
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,290
然后失望地回家
I go home disappointed.

481
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,910

488
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,250

你花了好多年假设黑洞存在

你相信天鹅座X-1星很可能

是我们能观测到的第一个黑洞

01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,900
我的新课题证明那是错的
My new project disproves it.

600
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,060
是错的
Disproves it?

601
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,480
是错的
Yes.

602
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,720
那你不再相信创世理论了
So, then, you no longer believe in the Creation?

603
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,260
在物理学里  人信仰什么是...
What one believes is irrelevant...

604
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,080
...是不重要的
...irrelevant in physics.

605
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,120
好吧
I see.

606
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:16,200
斯蒂芬来了个大转弯
Stephen's done a U-turn.

607
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,020
新的理论是宇宙没有边界
The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all.

608
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,560
没有边界  没有开端...
No boundaries, no beginning...

609
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,850
...也没有上帝
...and no God. Oh!

610
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,050
明白了  我还以为
Oh, I see... I... I thought that...

611
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,570
你证明宇宙有开端
you'd proved the universe

612
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,770
进一步证明有创世主
had a beginning and thus a need for a Creator.

613
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:39,060
-我的错  -是我的
- My mistake. - No... mine.

614
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,080
斯蒂芬想找到一个理论
Stephen is looking for a single theory

615
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,080
来解释宇宙中的一切
that explains all the forces in the universe.

616
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,270
这样上帝就必须死
Therefore, God must die.

617
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,980
为什么上帝必须死  我不明白
Why must God die, I don't see.

618
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:58,190
物理学的两大支柱是  量子论
The two great pillars of physics are: Quantum Theory,

619
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,230
针对所有微小粒子的理论
the laws that govern the very small particles,

620
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,870
电子什么的  还有广义相对论
electrons and so on, and General Relativity.

621
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,320
对  爱因斯坦
Ah, yes, Einstein.

622
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,410
爱因斯坦的理论  针对非常巨大的
Einstein's theory, the law that governs the very large,

623
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:14,100
恒星什么的  但量子论  和相对论
planets and such, but Quantum, and Relativity...

624
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,190
别说  他们是不一样的
Don't tell me... they're different?

625
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,180
一点也不一样
They don't remotely play by the same rules.

626
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:23,830
如果宇宙里只有土豆  那很简单
If the world were all potatoes, then, easy

627
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,410
我们可以追溯回去  像斯蒂芬之前一样
you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did,

628
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,790
找到创世的那一刻
a moment of Creation.

629
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,780
哈利路亚  上帝是存在的
Hallelujah, God lives.

630
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,870
可是有了豌豆之后
If you incorporate peas into the menu,

631
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,250
就变得有点...
then it all goes a little...

632
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,090
...乱搞了
...tits up.

633
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,000
没错  疯掉了
Yes, haywire.

634
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,410
-变成了没有上帝的乱世  -天啊
- It all becomes a Godless mess. - Oh, dear.

635
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,000
爱因斯坦讨厌豌豆
Einstein hated peas.

636
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,420
也就是量子论  他说
Quantum Theory, he said,

637
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,560
"上帝不掷骰子"
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

638
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,840
可是他不仅玩骰子
Seems he not only plays the dice,

639
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,000
还扔到了我们看不到的地方
but he throws them where we can't find them.

640
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:05,380
上帝又变成了珍稀物种
God is back on the endangered species list.

641
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,270
他应该能适应的
Well, I expect He'll cope.

642
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,360
物理学又登场了
But physics is back in business.

643
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,820
对  物理学又登场了
Yes, physics is back in business.

644
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,360
我以前结过婚
I was married... actually.

645
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,220
可她突然去世了
But suddenly... she passed.

646
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,490
差不多一年了
Almost a year ago now.

647
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,930
白血病
It was leukemia.

648
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:52,860
她抗争过  我也尽力照顾  可还是...
She fought it and I nursed her, but in the end...

649
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:04,870
我特别孤独  独守空房
I do get quite lonely... the tyranny of the empty room.

650
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,660
什么的
And all that.

651
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:11,200
但音乐拯救了我  在唱诗班  教人弹琴
But... music is my salvation... teaching and playing.

652
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,230
算不上职业吧
Not really as a career,

653
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,290
反正我也没有什么野心
but I... I'm not that ambitious, so...

654
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:25,220
这算不算是罪  我也不知道
Is that a sin? I don't know.

655
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,480
问错人了
Wrong man to ask.

656
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,670
-谢谢你们的招待  -谢谢你能来
- Thank you so much for having me. - Thank you for coming.

657
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,230
真是太...太好了
It was re... really... really wonderful.

658
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:44,150
如果有什么能帮你的
If there's anything I can do to be of service... to you.

659
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,000
我是说帮你们家
To the family, I mean.

660
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,510
不要客气
I would... consider it a privilege.

661
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,730
我没有孩子  单身也没什么负担
I have no children, or commitments.

662
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,980
我没别的意思  就是想帮你  我...
I only mean that if I... could be of help, I've...

663
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,130
我肯定...  也算是
I'm... really, if I might find a purpose

664
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:02,410
帮我排解孤独了
that would help alleviate my own situation.

665
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,590
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Night.

666
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:46,060
我理解你的
I understand...

667
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,940
如果你需要帮助...
If you need help...

668
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:59,490
并且有人愿意帮忙
If someone is prepared to offer...

669
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,640
我不会反对的
I won't object.

670
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:33,860
您是一人   也是万物
Calls you one and calls you all,

671
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,920
他的领域  永存于世
to gain his everlasting hall.

672
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:43,840
生为救赎  解救众生
Christ was born to save. Christ was born to save.

673
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,070
太棒了  大家可以走了
Great! Lovely! Okay! We can go!

674
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,850
-刚刚七点二十五  -谢谢
- Just going on seven twenty-five. - Thank you.

675
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:53,370
能...谁能给我留一份
I'm... could... could you all leave a copy of that?

676
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,180
我有话要跟你说
There's something I need to tell you.

677
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,400
什么
What?

678
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,490
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

679
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,910
天啊  我...我还以为你和斯蒂芬
Gosh! I... I, um... I assumed that you and Stephen...

680
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,510
真...真是太棒了
Well, that's... that's really wonderful.

681
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,730
-确实  -真的  太美妙了
- It is. - Yes, it's wonderful.

682
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,510
-简  恭喜你  -谢谢
- Congratulations, Jane. - Thank you.

683
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,530
说"茄子"  准备好了吗
Everyone say "Cheese"! Ready?

684
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,560
我数到三  1  2  3
Count 3! 1, 2, 3...

685
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,340
茄子
Cheese!

686
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,520
-妈妈  -来了
- Mummy! - Just coming.

687
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,160
那个
Now, you know...

688
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,090
我一直都很支持你
I've always been supportive

689
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:15,970
不请人来帮忙
of your choice not to have home help,

690
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,240
但我们得想个长远的办法
but we need to find a permanent solution.

691
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,660
这种...这种...
This... this...

692
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,300
这种状况不是长久之计
situation cannot continue,

693
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,860
你得赶紧找个常住的护工
you need to have a proper live-in nurse immediately.

694
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,220
有人照顾我
We have help.

695
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:33,360
你知道我什么意思
Look... you know what I'm talking about.

696
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,840
我们雇不起护工
We can't afford a live-in nurse.

697
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,160
斯蒂芬  这样不是办法
Stephen, you need to find a way,

698
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,740
为了你的家人
for your family's sake...

699
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,480
你已经是世界名人了
you're world famous.

700
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:46,910
我是因为黑洞出名的  又不是摇滚乐
For black holes, not for rock concerts.

701
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,090
斯蒂芬  我没开玩笑  这事不能拖
Stephen, this isn't funny, I believe it's urgent.

702
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,520
我们有权知道真相
We do have a right to know.

703
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:18,140
简  我们有权知道
We have a right to know, Jane.

704
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,100
知道什么
Know what?

705
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,080
蒂莫西的爸爸是谁...
Whose child Timothy is...

706
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,060
斯蒂芬还是乔纳森
Stephen's, or Jonathan's?

707
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:33,820
我在你们眼里就是那样的人
That's what you think of me?

708
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,160
除了斯蒂芬
There is no way that Timothy

709
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,280
没人可能是蒂莫西的爸爸
could have any other father than Stephen.

710
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,460
行了吧
Enough!

711
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,770
-乔纳森  别走  -我该走了
- Jonathan, please don't go. - I have to go.

712
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,770
-所有人都说我们...  -那又怎样
- Everybody's talking, and... - So, what does it matter?

713
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,890
我很难做下去  我只是想帮你们
It's difficult for me because I'm just trying to help.

714
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,580
我当然知道
I know you're trying to help

715
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,500
而且你帮了很大忙
and your help is valueless.

716
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,800
我想现在我最好还是
The best thing for me right thing right now,

717
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,740
还是...还是
I think, maybe if... if... if...

718
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,140
...退出你们的生活吧
...I just step back for now.

719
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,460
乔纳森  别这样
Please, Jonathan,

720
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,870
我们需要你  孩子需要你
we need you, the children need you,

721
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,810
我需要你  斯蒂芬也需要你
and I need you, and Stephen needs you.

722
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:11,660
-乔纳森  -别说这些了
- Jonathan... - Don't think of it.

723
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,180
但是  简  还有别的原因
But there's other things as well. Jane, I...

724
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,950
我对你有感觉
I have feelings for you.

725
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,110
我对你也是
And I have feelings for you, too.

726
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,900
简  谢谢你
Thank you, Jane.

727
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:26,000
有人邀我去波尔多
I've been invited to Bordeaux.

728
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:30,720
-去哪  -波尔多
- Invited where? - To Bordeaux.

729
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,500
你要去波尔多
To Bordeaux?

730
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,180
马克他们吗
Mark and them?

731
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,710
学生们可以带我去
Students can take me,

732
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,240
我知道你不喜欢坐飞机
I know you hate flying.

733
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,930
我确实讨厌坐飞机
I do hate to fly.

734
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:52,340
你开车去吧  我们波尔多见
Bring the car, meet me in Bordeaux.

735
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,090
这样孩子们也舒服些
Make the children comfy.

736
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,300
斯蒂芬  你一个人去太不方便了
It'd be too difficult to manage, Stephen.

737
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:13,400
让乔纳森陪你吧
Bring Jonathan.

738
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,270
他不一定愿意去吧
I doubt he would be willing.

739
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,590
你好啊  斯蒂芬
Hello, Stephen.

740
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,010
-喝这个行吗  -这个...
- Is this okay? - Well...

741
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,160
我是不会说出去的
I won't tell if you won't.

742
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,490
但是...
Just...

743
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,880
别喝多  你还得开车呢
bearing in mind you have to drive.

744
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:35,130
简需要你的帮助
Jane needs help.

745
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,800
萨拉  千万记得
Sarah, you won't forget to give him

746
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,790
一着陆就给他注射药物
the injection as soon as soon as you land, will you.

747
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,050
到宾馆记得给我打个电话
And you'll call me when you get to the hotel.

748
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,320
-不会忘的  -保证
- I will. -Yes? Promise?

749
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,450
-一定不会  -好
- Yeah. - Good!

750
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,080
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

751
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:03,320
妈妈带孩子去
Mum'll take the baby.

752
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:07,040
-她一会就到  -我们波尔多见
- She'll be here any minute. - See you in Bordeaux.

753
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,600
千万注意
You be good.

754
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,240
-他们睡了吗  -睡了
- They asleep? - Yeah.

755
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,780
乔纳森
Jonathan.

756
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,220
乔纳森
Jonathan?

757
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:57,610
乔纳森  斯蒂芬出事了
Jonathan, it's Stephen, he's been just taken ill,

758
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:00,120
他突然病重  被送到了医院
he's in the hospital right now,

759
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,430
现在还在昏迷
he's in a coma.

760
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,430
{\an8}他怎么了

761
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:37,430
{\an8}他感染了重度肺炎

762
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,430
{\an8}现在全靠呼吸机维持

763
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,430
{\an8}不知道他还能撑多久

764
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,430
{\an8}我得问问我的同事

765
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:53,430
{\an8}能不能撤掉呼吸机

766
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,420
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

767
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,730
可以让他没有痛苦的离开
This way would be a painless end.

768
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,920
让他脱离麻醉状态
If we try to bring him round from the anesthetic

769
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,100
也不一定能保他的命
it's not sure he will survive resuscitation.

770
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,940
让他脱离麻醉状态
You have to bring him round from the anesthetic!

771
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,790
你确定真要这么做
Are you sure it's what you want?

772
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,940
让他呼吸的唯一方法
The only way of weaning him off the ventilator

773
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,110
就是实施气管切开手术
would be to give him a tracheotomy,

774
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,330
在脖子上开刀  从喉咙旁边过去
a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat.

775
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:30,770
他就再也没法说话了
He will never speak again.

776
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:39,850
没得商量  必须要保住他的命
There's no question... Stephen must live.

777
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,230
需要什么就用什么
I will see he gets everything he needs.

778
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,290
然后转院回剑桥
I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.

779
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:54,040
-他很可能下不了手术台  -他能的
- He may not survive the journey. - Yes, he will.

780
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,110
我知道
I know.

781
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,740
我就...
I'll...

782
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,150
不去了
step back.

783
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,890
你东西都带齐了吗
Did you get everything in the car...

784
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,750
他的轮椅  设备什么的
his chair, and his equipment, and everything?

785
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:40,420
再见了
Goodbye.

786
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,420
斯蒂芬
Stephen?

787
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:38,080
这是个拼字板
This is a spelling board.

788
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,650
我先说颜色
Firstly, you tell me

01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:45,030
你要哪个颜色
what letter you want by blinking

790
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,320
就对我眨下眼睛
when I say the color of the group that contains that letter.

791
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,740
确定了颜色以后
Once I know the group,

792
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,260
我说到你要的字母
you can choose the character inside that group by

793
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:58,310
你就眨下眼睛
by blinking again when I say the color of each letter with that group...

794
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,050
...很简单
...apparently

795
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,810

拿了些零件
from a telephone answering system, actually,

862
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,920
把文字转换成语音
to convert the written text into synthesized speech.

863
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,270
声音是有点像机器人  但总比...

目前我只有这一种
It's the only one lately I have at the moment.

874

01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,310
也许未来  这些问题会变得
Some day these answers may seem

889
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,630
像地球绕着太阳转一样平常
as obvious to us as the Earth orbiting the sun,

890
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,180
抑或如乌龟塔般荒谬
or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises.

891
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,180
{\an8}古代人对宇宙的认识

我们是谁  为何存在于此

915
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:45,450
这两个问题如果有答案
If ever learn this it would be

916
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:48,150
会是人类思想史上的重大突破
the ultimate triumph of the human reason,

917
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,150
因为那时  我们才真的理解了上帝
for then we would know the mind of God.

918
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,420
-你真这么觉得  -是的

已经许多年了
You've had so many.

一切都会好起来的
Everything will be okay.

我1963年第一次见到霍金教授
I first met the Professor in 1963.

943
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:57,050
一转眼  白驹过隙一样
And there you are... time, where did it go?

944
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:00,030
看着他挑战极限
It has been one of the great joys of my life

945

无论是科学上的
to watch this man

946
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:07,760
还是医学上的  都使我倍感欣慰
defy every expectation, both scientific and personal.

947
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:13,260
有请我敬爱的同事
Please welcome onto the stage my esteemed colleague,

非常感谢  我们先来讨论

01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,650
现在您已是名扬四海
Now you are recognized everywhere.

953
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:55,220
您是如何处理大家的关注的呢
How do you deal with all the attention?

954
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:59,370
最近  我在剑桥被一位游客拦住
I was stopped recently by a tourist at Cambridge

955
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,700
他问我是否真的是霍金
who asked if I was the real Stephen Hawking.

956
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,820
我回答说我不是
I replied I was not,

957
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:07,970
霍金本人比我帅多了
and said the real one was much better looking.

958
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:12,770
1979年  您曾表示
In 1979, you talked about

959
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:15,590
有望在本世纪末
the possibility of a Theory of Everything.

960
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:18,540
发现适用万物的理论
being discovered before the end of the century.

961
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,420
我现在预言我当时错了
I now predict that I was wrong.

962
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,920
霍金教授  您说过您不信上帝
Professor Hawking, you have said you do not believe in God.

963
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:41,280
您说过您不信上帝
You have said you did not believe in God.

964
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:45,990
那么您有什么指导您的生活哲学吗
Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you?

965
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:12,920
我们人类也不过是高级灵长类动物
It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of primates,

966
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,820
生活在一颗小星球上
on a minor planet orbiting

967
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:17,180
绕着一颗普通的恒星转
around a very average star,

968
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:19,540
我们生活的银河系之外
in the outer suburb of one

969
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:22,100
还有上亿个星系
among a hundred billion galaxies...

970
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:28,340
然而  自人类文明诞生以来
But, ever since the dawn of civilization,

971
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,180
人们就没有停止过
people have craved for

972
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,820
对世界根本规律的探索
an understanding of the underlying order of the world.

973
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:37,130
宇宙的边界是什么
There ought to be something

974
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:40,780
肯定有个特别的答案
very special about the boundary conditions of the universe.

975
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,010
但是还有比没有边界更特别的答案吗
And what can be more special than that there is no boundary?

976
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:52,630
同样  人类的潜力也不会有边界
And there should be no boundary to human endeavor.

977
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,420
我们都是与众不同的
We are all different.

978
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:58,920
无论生活多么艰辛
However bad life may seem,

979
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:03,180
你总会有自己的方式发光
there is always something you can do, and succeed at.

980
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:07,390
生命不息  希望不止
While there is life, there is hope.

981
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:40,990
是斯蒂芬的来信
It's from Stephen.

982
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,380
天啊
Gosh.

983
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:12,000
你眼镜总是这么脏
Your glasses are always dirty.

984
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:32,780
霍金教授  霍金夫人  女王接见
Professor and Missus Hawking, Her Majesty the Queen.

985
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:04,750
恭喜你
Congratulations.

986
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:09,530
我的"荣誉伴侣"
My "Companion of Honor".

987
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:13,610
干得好  主张自由社会主义的老头子
Not bad for an old liberal socialist.

988
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,020
别担心  你还是可以拒绝授衔的
Don't worry, you can decline the knighthood.

989
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,760
谢谢你请我来

990
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,830
真的很棒
It was extraordinary.

991
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:37,850
我们这一路一直都很棒  是吧
It's all been rather extraordinary, though, hasn't it?

992
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:48,540
你在写什么
What are you writing?

993
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:04,250
看看我们的成果
Look what we made.

994
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:52,860
{\an8}{\pos(192,82)}《时间简史》在全球销量超过千万
虽然已经72岁了  斯蒂芬依然没有退休
继续探索万物理论

995
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:52,860
{\an8}{\pos(192,181)}他婉拒了女王授予的骑士头衔

996
01:56:54,050 --> 01:57:03,620
{\an8}{\pos(192,78)}简拿到了西班牙诗歌的博士学位
她与乔纳森喜结连理
简和斯蒂芬依然是好朋友  现已经有三个孙辈

997
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:13,650
{\an5}英国大学学位分等级
一般来说  一等学位要求均分70以上
霍金的本科三年只有一次考试  也就是毕业考试
由于紧张他发挥失常  成绩处在一等与二等的边缘
因此需要追加一次面试
