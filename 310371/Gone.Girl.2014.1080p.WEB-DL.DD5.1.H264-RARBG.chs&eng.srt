你看到了不起的艾米走上红毯会不会难过
it's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

还有这个庆祝这场虚拟婚礼的盛大派对

在这段时间里  你非常体贴
In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity

261
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,420
比如尼克把"藜麦"说成"梨买"
to perform such gracious gestures as

262
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,380
你也不去纠正他
not correcting Nick when he pronounced "Quinoa" as "Kween-o-a."

263
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,890
可以理解的错误

他以为藜麦是种鱼

265
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,730
他还以为美式软奶酪是奶酪
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.

266
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,060
尼克年迈的母亲每次见到你

268
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,680
都会即兴表演《纽约纽约》时
when Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition

269
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,940
你每次都能表现得很惊喜

这些破鞋子

你还给尼克买了他人生中第一把剪刀

我的同僚们告诉我你还未婚
My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married.

280
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,760
是否正确
Is that correct?

281
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,260
我是未婚
I'm not.

282
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,630
我们是不是该解决下这个问题了
Isn't it time we fixed that?

283
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,770
然后
And then...

好了  这事算完成了
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

286
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,960
这种案子我们一般来说
Now, normally, we would not

287
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,500
不会马上以失踪案处理
treat this as a missing persons case so quick,

288
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,980
但鉴于你屋子里的情况
but given the scene at your house,

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,120
还有最近激增的暴力犯罪事件
and given our spike in violent crime of late,

290
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,630

-我可以住我姐姐那  -好

我们会追踪艾米的手机  信用卡

296
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,640
还会组织搜索  张贴传单

自己好像在演《法律与秩序》
I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode.

303
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,870
此类案件时间都很紧迫
Now, time is of the essence in these cases.

304
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,660
但话说回来  你想找律师吗
But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

305
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,840
完全不用  我想帮忙
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

306
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,660
你和艾米来这两年了
So, you and Amy have been here two years.

307
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,970
-你是酒保  -我是老板
- You tend bar... - I own the bar.

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
我还在莫霍克谷社区学院教创意写作
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

309
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,350
-没有孩子  -还没有
- No kids? - Not yet.

310
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,840
那艾米通常都做什么
So, what does Amy do most days?

311
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,100
有那么多学位  她都做些什么
A woman with all those degrees, what does she do?

312
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,020
我也不知道  她一直都挺忙的
I don't know. She keeps busy.

313
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,560
忙什么
Doing what?

314
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,090
其实  她特别爱读书
Yeah, I mean, She's a voracious reader.

315
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,280
所以她手里随时都拿着一本书
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

316
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,820
不过  长日漫漫
Well, days can get long.

317
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,120
我认识几个家庭主妇
I know a few housewives,

318
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,700
中午就开始喝红酒了
that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.

319
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,030
有的是吃处方药
Or prescription pills.

320
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,570
就在上周  有一位足球妈妈
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

321
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,570
{\an8}全职顾家支持孩子学习生活的母亲

322
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,000
人很好
Nice lady.

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,080
因为吃奥施康定[止痛药]出事掉了几颗牙
Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin.

324
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,210
自从那间商场倒闭  半个城的人都失业了
Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work.

325
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,740
毒品暴力的问题我们实在处理不过来
We cannot keep up with the drug violence.

326
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,210
我保证  不是毒品暴力的问题
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

327
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,090
艾米有没有什么朋友可以跟我们谈一谈
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

328
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,380
没  没有
No, not really.

329
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,380
这么大的地方  连一个朋友都没有
No friends? This whole town?

330
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,050
我妈去世以前  她和我妈的关系很好
She was very close with my mom, before she passed away.

331
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,210
我们小区那一带的流浪汉
You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem.

332
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,380
很是问题的
In our neighborhood.

333
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,480
我觉得你们应该查查这个
I think maybe you guys should check that out.

334
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,770
我们会调查的
We'll look into that.

335
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,440
你今天十一点左右到酒吧
So, you got to the bar around 11:00 today.

336
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,070
那之前你在哪儿  正常排查而已
Where were you before that? Just to cross that out.

337
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
早上我在家
Well, I was home.

338
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,740
九点半出门  买了杯咖啡跟报纸
I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

339
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,410
到索耶海滩看了会儿报纸
I went to Sawyer beach and read the news.

340
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,610
你在那有碰见谁吗
Did you visit with anyone there?

341
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,610
我就图那里没人打扰
I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude.

342
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,360
所以说  你妻子在这里没有朋友
So, your wife has no friends here.

343
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,250
那她是不是比较冷漠呢
Is she kinda standoffish?

344
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,710
读了名校  心高气傲什么的
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

345
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,250
她是纽约来的
She's from New York.

346
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,760
她比较复杂  生活标准很高
She's complicated. She's got very high standards.

347
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
A型人格
Type A?

348
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,540
如果性格不合  A型性格的人能把你逼疯
That can make you crazy if you're not like that.

349
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,420
你看起来比较闲散  是B型人格
You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.

350
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,640
顺便问一下  艾米是什么血型
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

351
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,980
老天  我不知道  我得回家查一下
God, I don't know. I'd have to look it up at the house.

352
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,310
你不知道她有没有朋友
You don't know if she has friends,

353
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,800
也不知道她每天都做些什么
you don't know what she does all day.

354
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,760
连你老婆的血型都不知道
And you don't know your wife's blood type.

355
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,930
你确定你俩结婚了吗
Sure you all are married?

356
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,690
可能是O型
Maybe it's type O.

357
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,910
-她的父母在哪  纽约吗  -是的
- Where are her folks? New York? - Yeah.

358
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,650
他们能及时赶过来参加明天的新闻发布会吗
Can they get here in time for this press conference tomorrow?

359
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,730
明天吗  我不知道  我还没告诉他们
Tomorrow? I have no idea. I haven't talked to them.

360
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,620
你还没给你老婆的父母打电话
You haven't called your wife's parents yet?

361
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,980
这栋楼又没信号
You can't get a signal in this building.

362
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,080

363
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,580
给他们打电话  尼克  现在就打
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

364
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,830
好吧
Fine.

365
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,290
我应该知道自己老婆的血型吗
Should I know my wife's blood type?

366
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
不用
No.

367
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,460
抱歉  玛丽贝思  我也不知道是怎么回事
I apologize, Marybeth. I didn't know what was going on.

368
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,010
我现在在警局
You know, now I'm at the station.

369

家里都是警察
And the cops are at the house,

370
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,550
事情比较严重  所以我给你打电话
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

371
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,220
现在很多事情都还不清楚
There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now.

372
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,530
我现在就站在朗达·邦妮警探旁边
I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda Boney.

373
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,520
她负责这个案件

我岳母想跟你说几句

我不明白为什么我得待在这

这是我父亲  出什么事了

是吗  你就是尼克·邓恩

382
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,710
联系你一下午都没找到你
We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon.

383

你父亲午饭后离开养老院四处游荡

我手机在这栋楼里收不到信号

先生  请不要用这种语气跟我说话

好了  有什么发现吗
All right. So, what do you got?

460
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,840
你在厨房看到的肯定是溅出来的血

厨房嘛  刀具  准备食物什么的

我不明白这有什么好奇怪的
I don't know that that's so surprising.

472
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,480
不奇怪  但很耻辱

千万别说  跟老爸一副德行
please don't say, "Like dad."

487
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,800
要么你就得发动你的乖宝宝魅力攻势
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy charm offensive,

488
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,840
不过那就有点不正经了

489
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,660

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,520
我是尼古拉斯·邓恩
Nicholas Dunne.

602
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,280
这房子登记在我父亲威廉·邓恩名下
Under my father's name, William Dunne.

603
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,040
我妻子的第一只宠物  这有必要吗
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?

604
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,790
能不能把警报...
Can you just turn the bell...

605
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,830
我知道
yeah, I know.

606
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,210
是"小邋遢"吗  还是"贵宾犬"
It's "Puddles", right? Or is it "Poodles"?

607
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,760
没事了
We're good.

608
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,460
你好啊  陌生人
Hello, stranger.

609
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,640
没想到能在这遇到你
Fancy meeting you here.

610
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,980
这是你爸爸的屋子吧
It's your dad's house, right?

611
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,640
你在跟踪我吗
Are you following me?

612
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,550
你来这干什么
What you doing?

613
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,770
如你所说  这是我爸的屋子
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

614
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,520
我每周都会来看一眼  防止失火什么的
I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down.

615
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,610
看来今天还好
But it looks okay.

616
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,240
我送你出去吧
I'll walk you out.

617
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,280
我觉得这就是所谓的棕色小屋了
You know, I thought maybe this was the little brown house.

618
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,540
线索里提到的那栋
From the clue.

619
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,540
不可能  明明是蓝色
Nope. Still blue.

620
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,220
想象我是个很坏很坏的女孩
Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

621
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,980
我必须受到惩罚  活该被逮个正着
I need to be punished, and by "Punished," I mean "Had."

622
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,610
有人在那里为结婚五周年藏起了好东西
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.

623
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,660
"快打开门来  仔细瞧一瞧
"So open the door, and look alive."

624
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,990
贱货
Bitch!

625
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,730
{\an8}{\pos(135.75,88)}2010年7月18日

626
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,700
想找到你婚姻的软肋吗
Want to test your marriage for weak spots?

627
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,830
只需加一场经济萧条
Add one recession.

628
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,460
再减去两份工作
Subtract two jobs.

629
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,160
出奇地有效
It's surprisingly effective.

630
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,620
答应我永远别像他们一样
Promise me we'll never be like them.

631
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,790
像谁一样
Like who?

632
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
那些失败的夫妻
All those awful couples we know.

633
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,590
妻子把丈夫当成马戏团的猴子
Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys.

634
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,700
训着管着还得带出去给人看
To be trained and paraded.

635
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,430
丈夫眼中妻子就跟公路巡警似的
Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol.

636
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,400
怕着躲着还得时刻算计着
To be out-foxed and avoided.

637
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,820
我快被炒鱿鱼了
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

638
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,540
虽然现在经济衰退
We're in a recession.

639
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,400
不过没有过不去的坎儿
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

640
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,660
我可能也会失业
I'll probably be next.

641
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,950
但我们拥有彼此
We have each other.

642
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,870
别的都是身外之物
Everything else is background noise.

643
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,740
你真是独一无二
You are exceptional.

644
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,710
到我说了
My turn.

645
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,270
我父母的出版商不理他们
My parents' publisher dropped them,

646
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,050
他们现在债台高筑
and they're in debt up to their ears.

647
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,930
真糟糕
That's terrible.

648
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,390
他们得从我的信托基金里拿钱还债
And they need to borrow from my trust fund.

649
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,930
花了多少
How much?

650
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,190
差不多一百万
Almost a million.

651
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,360
那不是要用完了吗
That's almost all of it.

652
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,700
所以轮到你说"别的都是身外之物"了
This is where you say, "Everything else is background noise."

653
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,770
艾米  要是你失业了
Amy, if you're laid off.

654
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,190
我也失业了
And I'm laid off.

655
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,360
我已经决定好了
I said I'd do it.

656
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,650
都不和我商量一下吗
Without talking to me?

657
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,280
-其实...  -你说了算
- Well, it's... - Your call.

658
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,900
这本来就是他们的钱
Their money, technically.

659
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,000
你说得对
You know what? You're right.

660
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
别的都是身外之物
Everything else is just background noise.

661
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,880
还买游戏
More games?

662
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,550
没错  满足一下开枪杀人的欲望
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

663
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,230
那买这手提电脑干什么
What's the laptop for?

664
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,310
用
Laptoping.

665
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,480
我算明白了
I see.

666
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,020
你能在不和我商量的前提下
You can give your parents $879,000

667
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,520
借你父母八十八万还债
without talking to me,

668
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,700
而我未经你允许买款游戏就犯了天条了
but God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission.

669
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,790
你买的太多了
You are spending a lot.

670
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,070
你不相信我  你不相信我的判断
You don't trust me. You don't trust my judgment.

671
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,680
甚至怀疑我的动机
You certainly don't trust my intention.

672
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,660
你在胡扯什么
What are you talking about?

673
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,320
这是咱俩婚前约法三章的
That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it?

674
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,620
你怎么又拿这事来说理
Why are you throwing that in my face again?

675
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,210
因为我本来就占理
Because it's easy to throw.

676
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,050
尼克  我不明白
Nick, I don't get it.

677
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,420
为什么你要逼着我变成我不喜欢的样子
I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be.

678
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,540
变成一个唠唠叨叨控制欲爆表的泼妇
The nagging shrew. The controlling bitch.

679
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,960
我不是那样的人  我是你妻子
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

680
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,180
抱歉
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,560
我只是有点不知所措  我还未曾失业过
I just don't know how to do this. I've never not had a job.

682
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
以前我卖过汉堡  刷过墙  我不...
I flipped burgers, I painted houses. I don't...

683
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,650
你会找到新工作的
You'll get another job.

684
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,270
嗨  马尔
Hi, go.

685
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,770
什么  等等  你说什么
What? Hold on. What?

686
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,240
-突然间  -慢点儿说  怎么了
- And suddenly. - Slow down, what is it?

687
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
我发现一切只会变得更糟
I knew everything was about to get worse.

688
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,900
告诉我发生了什么事
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

689
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,900
{\pos(49,205)}七月七日

690
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,900
{\pos(41.5,238)}消失

691
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,900
{\pos(63.25,238)}两天后

692
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,770
-上帝保佑你  尼克  -神父
- Bless you, Nick. - Father.

693
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,860
汤姆  镇长先生  你们好
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

694
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,150
尼克  很高兴见到你
Nick, good to see you.

695
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,190
我也是
Good to see you.

696
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,480
小朋友们
Hey, guys, hey.

697
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,400
-乔蒂  -尼克
- Jodie. - Nick.

698
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,730
我们会找到她的
Oh, we'll find her.

699
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,420
你脸色真差
You look like hammered shit.

700
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,140
谢谢
Thank you.

701
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,950
你见过那个戴眼镜的家伙吗
You ever see that guy in the glasses before?

702
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,540
别担心  我们录下了
Don't worry. We videotape everybody

703
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,350
所有出入这栋建筑的人
that comes in and out of these things.

704
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,190
你似乎找了不少
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

705
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,270
伪善人
Do-gooders?

706
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,530
怪人
Freaks.

707
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,530
我想问问你
Hey, I meant to ask you.

708
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,030
诺艾尔·霍桑
Noelle Hawthorne?

709
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,630
她是你邻居  也是艾米最好的朋友
She lives on your street. Amy's best friend.

710
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,070
从没听过诺艾尔·霍桑这名字
I've never heard the name Noelle Hawthorne.

711
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,290
就是有三胞胎的那一家
She and her husband have triplets.

712
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,450
可能打过几次招呼
Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street.

713
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,000
但绝不是什么最好的朋友
But "Best friend"? No.

714
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,750
抱歉  我过去一下
Excuse me, one sec.

715
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,140
他表现得就像和诺艾尔完全没有来往
He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.

716
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,270
意料之中
Of course he did.

717
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,930
来  这两个给你
Look, these two are yours.

718
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,340
看  他又在演好人了
Oh, look. He's being a good guy,

719
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,310
这样所有人才会觉得他是无辜的
so everybody can see him being a good guy.

720
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,140
你还真是不喜欢他啊
You really don't like him, do you?

721
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,690
他哪儿讨人喜欢了
What's to like?

722

724

谢谢关心
Thank you. That's kind.

726
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,810
你最近有好好吃饭吗
Are you remembering to eat?

727
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,980
吃了不少冻肉
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

728
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,180
那你可得尝尝我闻名世界的玉米鸡肉派
I'm gonna fix you up my world-famous chicken frito pie.

729
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,750
十分感谢  不过不用劳烦了
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

730
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,400
吃饱才有力气做事
You have to keep your strength.

731
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
你能...
Would you...

732
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,700
说"玉米鸡肉派"
Say, "Chicken frito pie!"

733
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,830
能麻烦你删了这张照片吗
You know what? Would you delete that picture for me?

734
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,750
-拍的很棒呀  -我知道
- It's a nice photo. - I know it is.

735
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,210
就当帮我个忙
But just do me a favor.

736
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,000
行吗
Will you?

737
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,960
拜托你删了这张照片吧
Would you go ahead and please delete that picture?

738
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
你就按一下
You just press...

739
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,540
你有病吧
What is wrong with you?

740
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,880
那别给其他人看  行吗
Could you please not share that with anyone?

741
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,250
我爱给谁看就给谁看
I will share it with whomever I please.

742
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,420
-伙计  -怎么了
- Dude. - Yeah?

743
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,800
你岳母生气了
Marybeth is pissed.

744
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
她生什么气
Why?

745
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,770
玛丽贝思
Marybeth?

746
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,230
你还把自己当成返校节国王了
It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king.

747
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,110
我妈妈教导我要礼貌
It was important to my mother that I be polite.

748
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,070
要做个体贴的绅士
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

749
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,820
你好像玩得还挺开心
It looked like you were having fun.

750
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,120
这对我来说就是场噩梦
I am in a nightmare!

751
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,250
我只是想尽量用一副好脸色

-我不准  -你不准

906
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,760
你不准  凭什么  这还满足不了你吗
You won't? Why, it's not good enough for you?

907
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,710

It's not even close!

908

他推开我  我并不害怕
What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me.

910
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,310
我怕的是他还会怎么伤害我

怕的是我终将意识到

我惧怕自己的丈夫
I am frightened of my own husband.

913

要我打电话叫增援吗
You want me to call for backup?

Cross it off the list.

她来买枪

931
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,430
我告诉她我不卖那玩意儿

我也不好受  她看上去相当绝望

她说要很小的  就能近距离开枪了
She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close.

934
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,990

在这地方看到那样的姑娘可忘不了

那样我就不得不告诉他们真相

947
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,020
可是说出来我自己都不会信
And I don't even know if I believe the truth.

我真觉得尼克会伤害我吗

埃伦  感谢你如此热情地欢迎我

我当然会为尼克·邓恩辩护
But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.

1025
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,030
虽然他没有在大家面前痛哭流涕
Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping,

1026
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,500
并不代表他就不受伤
that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

1027
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,860
坦纳  反社会的标志之一
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath

1028
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,880

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,880
真相是  在这种情况下要显得正常
But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath

1030
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,170
就太反社会了
to behave normally in this situation.

1031
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,960
因为这是世上最不正常的情况
Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world.

1032
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,680
坦纳  你是想告诉我这张照片
Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo

1033
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,970
根本不是正常行为吗
is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior?

1034
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,670
我最讨厌被女人批评攻击了
I'm so sick of being picked apart by women.

你就该遭这报应
That's exactly what you deserve.

00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,740

我们居然还没逮捕这家伙
I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy.

1042
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,820
不能因这金发碧眼的傻瓜的一面之辞
We're not gonna arrest anybody,

1043
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,420
我们就去逮捕谁
just because some blonde dunce says so.

1044
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,280
你这么给他开脱  爱上他了吗
Why are you going so easy on him? You got a crush?

1045
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,920
首先  我是在办案  不是搜捕女巫
One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witch-hunt.

1046
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,880
其次  别这么跟我说话  永远不要
And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever.

1047

She was trying to buy a gun.

1051
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,580
目前没有吸毒的可能  这条去掉了
No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list.

1052
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,590
我去找了照顾尼克父亲的护士们
I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father.

1053
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,350
那家伙虽是个混蛋  但虚弱到不行
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,

1054
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,340
所以也从单子上划去
so cross that off the list.

1055
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,740
鲁米诺荧光测试结果  厨房的血迹
So, luminol lit up the kitchen

1056
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,020
是七月四日的
like the 4th of July.

1057
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,510
血迹相当多
The blood is profuse.

1058
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,670
是艾米的  B型
It is Amy's, type B,

1059
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,780
很快就能提取出DNA了
and we should have DNA soon.

1060
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,890
可能的凶器呢
Thoughts on a weapon?

1061
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,860
这痕迹表明是被钝器重击所致
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

1062
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,240
也许是根球杆  或是小木棍
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

1063
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,080
她在那儿倒下了  但我怀疑她又爬起来了
She fell there, but I doubt she got back up.

1064
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,530
艾米的医疗记录拿到了吗
Amy's medical records come in?

1065
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,570
还没有  今晚晚些时候能拿到
No, we'll have them later tonight.

1066
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,580
我妻子说他是个杀手
My wife says he's a killer.

1067
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,170
好吧  要是蒂凡尼说...
Well, if Tiffany says...

1068
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,690
感谢你们都能来
Thank you all for coming out.

1069
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,000
唐尼  你还好吗
Hey Donnie, how are you?

1070
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,370
里克  非常感谢
Rich, thank you so much.

1071
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,310
非常感谢  谢谢你们今晚能来
Thank you, folks. Thank you for being here tonight.

1072
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,150
这对我们的家庭意义重大
It just means the world to our family.

1073
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,140
对艾米也是
And to Amy.

1074
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,730
大家都知道
As you all know,

1075
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,850
我的妻子  艾米·艾略特·邓恩
my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne.

1076
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,400
三天前失踪了
disappeared three days ago.

1077
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,540
我恳求任何知道相关信息的人
And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all.

1078
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,490
请站出来  帮助我们
Please come forward. Help us.

1079
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,450
太性感了
So hot.

1080
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,860
他太可怕了
He is so creepy.

1081
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,980
我想说几句
I wanna say something,

1082
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,370
因为我觉得你们也许会有疑问
because I think some of you might be wondering,

1083
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,340
却又出于礼貌不便提出
and are too polite to ask.

1084
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,920
我与我妻子的失踪毫不相干
I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife.

1085
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,460
我正配合警方调查
I'm cooperating with the police.

1086
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,550
我也没有雇律师
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1087
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,710
我没什么好隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

1088
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,510
艾米是我的灵魂伴侣
Amy is my soul mate.

1089
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,050
她美丽
She is brilliant,

1090
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,690
迷人而又睿智
she's charming, and wise.

1091
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,730
我爱你  艾米
I love you, Amy.

1092
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,950
混蛋
Asshole.

1093
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
我爱我的妻子
I love my wife.

1094
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,780
十分地爱
So much.

1095
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,620
也许我没有为了媒体的镜头而故作姿态
And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to,

1096
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,250
如果他们想以此惩罚我  我没意见
and if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay.

1097
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,000
但我想请求那些媒体人  请来骚扰我
But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me,

1098
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,090
但不要去骚扰这儿的人
but don't harass the people of this town.

1099
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,170
要嘲弄就嘲弄我吧
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1100
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,430
尼克
Nick!

1101
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,630
请不要把调查当儿戏
But please don't turn this investigation into a circus.

1102
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,230
你妻子在哪儿  尼克
Where's your wife, Nick?

1103
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,760
让警察去做他们的工作
Let the police do their jobs.

1104
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,800
你对你怀孕的妻子做了什么
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1105
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,890
你告诉他们了吗  尼克
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1106
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,990
你告诉他们艾米已经怀孕六周了吗
Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1107
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,870
感谢大家今晚的支持
Thank you for your support tonight.

1108
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,900
让我们一起寻找艾米
Let's find Amy.

1109
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,710
继续吧  如果你们想说点什么
Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something.

1110
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,170
吉尔  快去
Gil, go, go.

1111
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,630
尼克  你去哪儿
Nick, where are you going?

1112
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,260
拦住他
Stop him!

1113
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,500
现在不接受提问  谢谢
No questions right now. Thank you.

1114
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,550
你为什么要逃走
Why are you running away?

1115
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,050
别跑
Don't run.

1116
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,140
大家不要过来
Everybody, stay back.

1117
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,100
大伙  不要拍了  你们知道规矩的
Guys, come on. You know better.

1118
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,600
别踩草坪  从路缘上下来
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1119
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,070
-吉尔  -交给我
- Hey, Gil. - On it.

1120
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,150
好了
All right.

1121
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,980
好了  听她的  不许拍照
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1122
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,320
谁
Hello?

1123
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,620
谁
Hello?

1124
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,480
操
Fuck.

1125
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,040
你吓到我了  要喝一杯吗
You scared me. Want a drink?

1126
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,570
你知道她怀孕了吗
Did you know she was pregnant?

1127
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,150
我跟你说了
I told you,

1128
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,750
诺艾尔·霍桑就他妈疯了
Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1129
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,830
她都不认识艾米
She doesn't even know Amy.

1130
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,100
我看她们是对好闺蜜呢
They look like pretty good friends to me.

1131
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,940
我不知道
Look, I don't know.

1132
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,090
但这也证明不了她怀孕了
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1133
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,340
我们很快就能拿到她的医疗记录了
We have her medical records coming.

1134
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,260
-好  -趁这会我们聊聊
- Good. - So, let's talk while we wait.

1135
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,510
先从这边开始  犯罪现场
Let's start over here. The scene of the crime.

1136
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,440
我们见过不少私闯民宅的现场
You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions.

1137
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,430
数都数不清
Dozens and dozens.

1138
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,690
这块区域  我们一看见就觉得不对劲
This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it.

1139
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,900
一切都像是刻意摆出来的  看
The whole thing looked staged. Watch this.

1140
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,800
经历了一番生死搏斗
And yet, they remained upright

1141
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,240
却还能这么井然有序
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1142
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,400
我不知道  你想要我说什么
I don't know. What do you want me to say?

1143
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,080
你妻子失踪后你有打扫过房子吗
Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing?

1144
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
没有
No.

1145
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,370
因为我们的人做了荧光测试
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1146
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:22,080
很遗憾地告诉你  厨房那片可亮了
And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up.

1147
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,510
艾米在那儿流了很多血
Amy lost a lot of blood in there,

1148
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,370
尼克  很多
Nick. A lot.

1149
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,420
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1150
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,760
没错  接着有人给拖掉了
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1151
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:27,380
等一下
Wait a second.

1152
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,250
如果他们想要制造犯罪现场
Why would they mop up the blood,

1153
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,900
为什么还要把血给拖掉
if they're trying to stage a crime scene?

1154
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,670
没有血  也没有尸体  就意味着绑架
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping.

1155
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,140
也就告诉我们去调查外面的人
It tells us, look at people outside the house.

1156
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,600
就像你一直在提的那些流浪汉
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1157
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,730
一地的血  没有尸体  则意味着谋杀
A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide.

1158
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,770
那我们就要调查家里的人
It tells us to look at people inside the house.

1159
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,960
我们来就是为了这个  尼克
Which is what we're doing here, Nick.

1160
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,530
我知道了
I see.

1161
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,880
所以你的婚姻情况如何  尼克
So, how was your marriage, Nick?

1162
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,520
因为现在  只有诺艾尔的描述
Because right now, all we got is Noelle.

1163
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,110
她说  "不好"
She says, "Not good."

1164
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,650
吉尔  你和你妻子都因为些什么起争执
Gil, what do you and your wife argue about?

1165
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,820
-什么最让你生气  -钱  缺钱
- What pisses you off? - Money, lack thereof.

1166
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,610
我和我前任也是一样
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1167
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,460
之所以提这个
I mention that

1168
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,000
是因为我们看了你的财务状况  尼克
because we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1169
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,740
十一万七千美元的信用卡债务
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1170
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,750
-什么  -我调了些你买的东西的清单
- What? - I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1171
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,800
都是这些大手笔的挥霍
There are these fun little splurges.

1172
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,370
这些东西我都没买过
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1173
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,550
我都不打高尔夫
I don't even golf!

1174
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,920
我打  你买的都是好球杆
I do! You bought great clubs.

1175
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,250
我喜欢机器狗
I like the robot dog.

1176
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,260
这是身份盗窃  这是重罪
This is identity theft! This is a felony!

1177
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,260
我们得查出是谁干的
We need to find out who did this!

1178
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,060
好吧  那我们谈谈人寿保险
All right. Let's talk about life insurance.

1179
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,870
在四月份
Because in April,

1180
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,630
你把艾米的人寿保险保额突然提高到了
you bumped up Amy's life insurance

1181
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
一百二十万
to $1.2 million.

1182
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,510
我是提高了
Yes, I did.

1183
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,090
那是她的主意  她要我提高的
That was her idea. She wanted me to.

1184
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,300
文书的字都是你签的
You filed the paperwork.

1185
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,550
是她让我签的
Because she told me to!

1186
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,310
等一等
Hold on a sec.

1187
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,140
嗯  好的
Yeah? Okay.

1188
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,240
你确定
For sure?

1189
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:32,820
好吧
All right.

1190
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:37,910
她是怀孕了
She was pregnant.

1191
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,620
这事太扯了
This is insane.

1192
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,160
那么我的问题就变成了...
So, my question becomes...

1193
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:49,130
我不会再跟你说话了
I don't want to talk to you again, ever.

1194
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,340
除非有律师在场
Without a lawyer.

1195
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,680
马尔
Margo!

1196
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,360
等一下  让我说完
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1197
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,320
尼克
Nick?

1198
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,150
我听到了  我听到了  我也很惊讶
I hear you, I hear you. I was as surprised as...

1199
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,040
我知道你不开心  我也不知道她怀孕了
I know you're upset. I had no idea she was pregnant.

1200
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,580
我也是这么想的  但显然...
Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...

1201
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,210
你想知道真相吗
you want to know the truth?

1202
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,620
真相就是艾米不想要孩子
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1203
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,100
对  我也很震惊
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1204
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,230
你跟我说是你不想要孩子的
you told me you didn't want kids.

1205
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,620
我可不想吵架
I was trying to put a good face on.

1206
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,520
结果你老婆突然就怀孕了
Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife.

1207
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,900
这下你的问题严重了
That's a problem for you.

1208
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,030
再加上那个秘密小情人
Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend.

1209
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,520
拜托  别再看艾伦·阿伯特的节目了
Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

1210
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,890
那你他妈就告诉我事实
You have to fucking talk to me!

1211
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,910
我没跟你说她不想要孩子
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids,

1212
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,620
是因为她不想让别人知道  好吗
because she didn't want me to. OK?

1213
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,870
因为那样你们又会多一条恨她的理由
Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her.

1214
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,790
理由已经够多了  这样比较简单...
And we had enough of those already! It was easier to just...

1215
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:07,040
-骗我吗  -我想要孩子
- lie to me? - I wanted kids!

1216
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,250
我们刚搬来的时候  我去过人工受孕诊所
When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic!

1217
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,960
-没成功吗  -我做了我那一半
- It didn't work? - I did my part!

1218
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,050
打飞机吗
Masturbate.

1219
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,080
轮到艾米做她那一半的时候
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,

1220
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,790
突然她就说
all of a sudden it was like...

1221
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,380
"我不清楚诶  还是别做了吧"
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1222
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,420
现在还有谁会相信你的话
Now, who would believe you?

1223
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,790
好吧
All right.

1224
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:31,220
这是诊所寄来的信
This is a letter from the clinic.

1225
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,740
告诉我他们要销毁我的精子
Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample,

1226
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,770
除非我联系他们
unless I contact them.

1227
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,570
我把信给了艾米
So, I gave it to Amy.

1228
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:41,610
第二天却在垃圾桶里找到了它
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1229
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,240
可是那时候你已经和安迪好上了吧
But you were already with Andie by then, right?

1230
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,110
我想和艾米要个孩子
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1231
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,690
如果一年前艾米能怀孕的话
A year ago, Amy being pregnant

1232
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,340
那就再好不过了
would have been the best thing ever!

1233
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,760
"当你可怜的艾米染上风寒  甜点也..."
"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."

1234
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,180
这是你没解开的提示
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1235
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,350
对
Yeah.

1236
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,220
德西寄来的信
A letter from Desi.

1237
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,420
是艾米的那个变态前男友吗
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1238
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,840
对  那个愿意为她赴汤蹈火的大款
Yeah, it was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her.

1239
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,850
老是看到他的名字  真是恶心
It just kept hanging over my head. It was disgusting.

1240
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:11,890
你们的婚前协议
Your prenup?

1241
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,800
尼克  你为啥收着这些东西
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?

1242
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,190
你的恨意都在这个盒子里了
It's like a little box of hate.

1243
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,020
不知道  也许我确实恨她
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1244
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,020
不管怎样我都爱你
I love you no matter what.

1245
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,440
但是你必须告诉我
But you need to tell me.

1246
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,910
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

1247
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,360
你想问我什么
What are you asking me?

1248
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,120
你是要问我有没有杀我老婆吗  马尔
Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go?

1249
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,660
你是要问我这个吗  我有没有杀我老婆
Is that what you're asking me? If I murdered my wife?

1250
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,130
我不会问你这种问题的
I would never ask you that!

1251
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,090

仅仅这些是不够的
you don't stop there.

1351
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,770
你需要一本日记
You need a diary.

1352
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,730
至少三百条关于尼克和艾米的故事
Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story.

1353
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,690
先从童话般的热恋说起
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1354
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,040
那些都是真的  真实得残忍
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1355
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,070
必须把尼克和艾米写得非常可爱
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1356
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,040
然后  开始编造
After that, you invent.

1357
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,080
花天酒地
The spending.

1358
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,880
虐待和恐惧
The abuse. The fear.

1359
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,870
威胁使用暴力
The threat of violence.

1360
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,880
尼克还觉得自己是作家呢
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1361
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,880
烧掉刚刚好的一部分
Burn it just the right amount.

1362
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,590
确定警察能找到它
Make sure the cops will find it.

1363
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,650
最后  尊重传统  布置特别的寻宝游戏
Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt.

1364
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:53,030
如果我不出错  全世界都会憎恨尼克
And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick,

1365
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,040
{\pos(49,205)}七月五日

1366

1368
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,770
因为他杀了自己美丽的孕妇妻子
for killing his beautiful, pregnant wife.

1369
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,450
在愤怒平息后  当我准备好时
And after all the outrage, when I'm ready,

1370
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,490
我会吃上一把安眠药  然后跳进水里
I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills,

1371
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,040
口袋里装满石头
and a pocket full of stones.

1372
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,860
当他们找到我的尸体  他们会认为
And when they find my body, they'll know,

1373
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,210
尼克·邓恩像扔垃圾一样抛弃了他的妻子
Nick Dunne dumped his beloved like garbage.

1374
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,590
而她则缓缓飘落  飘过那些
And she floated down past all the other

1375
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,950
受尽凌辱  无人理会  无处求援的女人
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1376
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,300
然后  尼克也会死去
Then, Nick will die, too.

1377
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:21,040
尼克和艾米会彻底消失
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1378
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:23,210
不过  我们也从没存在过
But, then, we never really existed.

1379
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,480
尼克爱上的只是我扮演的女孩罢了
Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be.

1380
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,510
"好妹子"
"Cool girl."

1381
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,810
男人总是这么拍女孩马屁  不是吗
Men always use that, don't they? As their defining compliment.

1382
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,850
"她是个好妹子"
"She's a cool girl."

1383
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,110
好妹子很性感
Cool girl is hot.

1384
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,570
好妹子热情勇敢
Cool girl is game.

1385
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,610
好妹子幽默风趣
Cool girl is fun.

1386
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,440
好妹子从不对她的男人生气
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1387
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,120
她只会露出谦卑又忠诚的微笑
She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner

1388
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,740
然后把嘴凑上去被操
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1389
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,780
她喜欢他爱的一切
She likes what he likes.

1390
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,290
她的男人肯定是个喜欢色情漫画的音乐迷
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga.

1391
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,620
如果他喜欢狂野的女孩  她就是个时尚潮女
If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe,

1392
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,470
会在猫头鹰餐厅忍受着辣翅大聊橄榄球
who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1393
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:04,100
遇到尼克·邓恩的时候  我知道他想要个好妹子
When I met Nick Dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl.

1394
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:06,800
我承认  我愿意为了他尝试一次
And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try.

1395
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,850
我用蜜蜡刮掉了我的阴毛
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1396
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,650
我喝着罐装啤酒看亚当·桑德勒的喜剧
I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies.

1397
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:15,680
我吃冷掉的披萨  保持完美身材
I ate cold pizza and remained a size two.

1398
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,690
基本上定期给他口交
I blew him semi-regularly.

1399
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,350
我活在当下
I lived in the moment.

1400
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,190
我他妈享受人生
I was fucking game.

1401
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,860
不能说我一点儿都不喜欢那样
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1402
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,000
尼克发掘了我性格中从未出现过的部分
Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed.

1403
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,340
温和  幽默  轻松
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1404
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:36,290
但我也让他变得更聪明  更锋利
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1405
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,960
让他成为了和我旗鼓相当的对手
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1406
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,750
我造就了自己的梦中情人
I forged the man of my dreams.

1407

{\pos(67,239)}十小时后

1410
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:49,010
我们乐于扮演别人
We were happy pretending to be other people.

1411
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,880
我们是最幸福的夫妻
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1412
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,780
如果不是最幸福的一对
And what's the point of being together,

1413
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,520
那还在一起干什么呢
if you're not the happiest?

1414
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,400
可尼克变得懒惰
But Nick got lazy.

1415
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,650
变成了我绝不会嫁给的男人
He became someone I did not agree to marry.

1416
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,860
他居然希望我无条件地爱他
He actually expected me to love him unconditionally.

1417
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,550
然后他把身无分文的我
Then he dragged me, penniless,

1418
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:09,040
拖来了中部的穷乡僻壤
to the navel of this great country

1419
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:13,030
给自己找了个更新鲜  更年轻  更活泼的
And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier

1420
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,080
好妹子
Cool girl.

1421
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,830
我会看着他毁掉我
You think I'd let him destroy me

1422
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,590
然后自己去过幸福生活吗
And end up happier than ever?

1423
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,760
门都没有
No fucking way.

1424
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,930
他不会赢的
He doesn't get to win.

1425
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:39,230
我可爱  有魅力  正直的密苏里男生
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.

1426
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,110
他需要上一课
He needed to learn.

1427
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,450
成年人会努力争取
Grown-ups work for things.

1428
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,950
成年人会付出努力
Grown-ups pay.

1429
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,920
成年人会承担后果
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1430
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,620
等一下
Wait.

1431
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,800
给我二十秒  不要责备我或者打断我
I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me

1432
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,470
也别生气
Or get angry.

1433
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,460
好吧
Okay.

1434
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,390
这是信用卡账单上的那些东西吗
Is that all the stuff from the credit cards?

1435
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,600
五周年纪念的东西都放哪了
Where do you store goodies for anniversary five?

1436
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,430
木婚
Wood.

1437
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,610
-所以是小木屋  -我的小木屋
- Woodshed. - Yeah, my woodshed.

1438
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,150

That fucking bitch.

1439
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,310
-我还以为...  -没关系
- I thought... - It's all right.

1440
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,820
换我也会那么想
I would have, too.

1441
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,480
那礼物是什么
What's that present?

1442
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,280
不知道
I don't know.

1443
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,290

Let's find out.

1444
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,260
"亲爱的老公  我知道
"Dear husband, I know

1445
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,800
你以为自己可以在这个世界上为所欲为
You think you're moving through this world unseen.

1446
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,260
别再这么想了
Don't believe that for a second.

1447
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,580
我知道你去过哪里  也知道你将要去哪里
I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.

1448
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,840
这个纪念日  我安排了一次旅行
For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip.

1449
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,770
沿着河流  一直向上
Follow the river, up, up, up.

1450
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,520
好好享受吧  因为你已经完蛋了
Sit back and relax, because you are done."

1451
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,980
"沿河向上"是什么意思
What's "Up, up river"?

1452
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,190
进监狱的意思
"Up the river." Prison.

1453
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,150
这贱人真他妈疯了
Fucking crazy bitch.

1454
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,810
原来是这样
That's what this is.

1455
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,160
她想诬陷我谋杀了她
She's framing me for her murder.

1456
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:10,480
你娶了个变态啊
You married a complete psychopath.

1457
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,660
周年纪念那天早上
The morning of our anniversary

1458
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,000
我想跟她提离婚的  我实在受不了了
I was gonna ask her for a divorce. I just couldn't do it.

1459
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,500
没办法再假装下去  一天都不行
I couldn't fake it for another year, another day.

1460
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,460
结果呢
Then what happened?

1461
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,800
在我开口以前  她说
Before I could say anything, she said,

1462
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,520
"我希望你出去静一静
"I need you to go somewhere,

1463
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,210
想想我们的婚姻"
and really think about our marriage."

1464
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,500
她知道我会去索耶沙滩
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1465
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,840
这样你就没有不在场证明了
So you'd have no alibi.

1466
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,100
她一步步操纵了我
She stage-managed me.

1467
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:34,050
她知道我会怎么做  我他妈还真的那么做了
She knew exactly what I would do. And I fucking did it.

1468
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:35,630
我去了沙滩  思考了我们的婚姻
I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage.

1469
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,390
决定回去提出离婚
I came back and decided I wanted a divorce.

1470
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,670
但等你到家的时候
And by the time you got home,

1471
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,220
她已经不见了
she was gone.

1472
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:43,360
-真他妈的  -她真厉害
- You fuck! - She's good.

1473
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,350
想到她不在了
Part of me was relieved

1474
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,700
我有点解脱了的感觉
when I thought she was gone.

1475
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,780
潘趣与朱迪的木偶
Punch and Judy puppets.

1476
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,870
记得吗  他把朱迪打死  又杀了孩子
Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby.

1477
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,030
所以我是潘趣咯
So I'm punch.

1478
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:03,740

We already knew that.

好吧  很高兴认识你
All right. Nice meeting you.

1498

我是南希
I'm Nancy.

1500
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,800
你要去码头吗  我需要涂点防晒霜
Are you going to the marina? I could use some creamer.

1501
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,260
抱歉  我帮不了你
I'm sorry. I can't.

1502
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,510
我还有事要做
I've got work to do.

1503
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,850
好吧  回头见
All right. See you around!

1504
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,050
会的
You will.

Come on. Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1510
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,910

1516
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,770
今天又热起来了
It's hot again today.

1517
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,890
你从哪来的
So, where are you from?

1518
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,570
我猜猜
Let me guess.

1519
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,690
内布拉斯加州
Nebraska.

1520
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,120
是新奥尔良市
New Orleans.

1521
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,080
如果要涂防晒油  我技术很好的
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1522
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,910
我猜也是
Oh, I just bet you are.

1523
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,590
润肤乳和香精  还有防晒霜
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1524
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,210
你们被晒黑了我可是会心疼的
I would hate for y'all to get tan lines.

1525
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,250
真贴心
So sweet.

1526
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,760
好吧  你们知道到哪里可以找到我
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1527
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,060
看来我们挑男人的眼光一致啊
I see we have the same taste in men.

1528
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,020
那种眼光已经被我丢进浴室的柜子里了
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1529
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,110
至少你可以不必为他保守秘密了
Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him.

1530
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,530
我猜猜看
Let me guess.

1531
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:18,450
他想看比赛  而你却在旁边唠叨个没完
He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up.

1532
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,580
不对  你看起来不像是话多的人
No, you don't seem like much of a talker.

1533
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,610
我懂了
I got it.

1534
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,070
你男人被你捉奸在床
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank,

1535
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,120
他也搅了你的好事  当做礼尚往来
and he apologized to you by busting you a good one.

1536
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,500
更糟糕
Worse.

1537
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,620
更糟吗
Worse?

1538
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,170
我去他上班的酒吧想给他一个惊喜
I went to the bar where he works to surprise him.

1539
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,710
结果他和一个
And out he comes with

1540
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,920
完全不该出现在酒吧的女孩出来了
this girl who had no business being in a bar.

1541
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,890
我们相识的第一个晚上
On the very first night that we met,

1542
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,310
走过一家在卸糖霜的面包店
we walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered.

1543
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,520
漫天都是糖霜  到处都是
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1544
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,850
像一场糖霜暴风雪
A sugar storm.

1545
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,030
他第一次吻我之前
And before he kissed me,

1546
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:00,160
他俯过身
he leaned in,

1547
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,940
做了这个动作
and did this.

1548
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,090
-猜猜怎么着  -怎么了
- And guess what. - What?

1549
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,840
他对她做了同样的动作
He did the exact same thing with her.

1550
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:26,090
这是我听过的最让我恶心的事了
That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard.

1551
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

1552
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,190
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

1553
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,280
好了  我们成焦点了
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1554
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:56,970

1557
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:12,020
这是上诉程序  我们会尝试起诉他们
It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1558
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,190
博尔特先生  坦纳·博尔特
Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?

1559
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,470
尼克·邓恩
Nick Dunne.

1560
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,810
我一直在等你的电话  我的朋友
I have been sitting by the phone, my friend.

1561
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,530
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1562
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,410
你不相信我吗
Do you not believe me?

1563
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,700
不  我相信  但这是我听过的最疯狂的事
No, I believe you. It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.

1564
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:33,070
我挺喜欢的  但对你来说  糟糕透顶
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1565
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:35,120
但这种情况下你不是应该
But you gotta have a grudging respect

1566
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,090
向她的手段致敬吗
for your wife at this point, right?

1567
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,700
-你是想把我嘲笑出去吗  -不
- Are you laughing me out of the building? - No!

1568
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,500
开什么玩笑  案子我接了
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1569
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,000
必须接
I'm way in.

1570
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,680
你找对人了  我就接这种案子  尼克
You came to the right guy. This is what I do, Nick.

1571
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,720
所以我的定金是十万
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.

1572
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,140
我能打赢"必输"的官司
I win the unwinnable cases.

1573
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,850
十万
$100,000?

1574
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,430
这个我们可以想办法
We'll figure something out.

1575
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,510
我会给你一个特别的
I'll give you a special

1576
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:55,430
"我的妻子深谙复仇之术"折扣
"My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" Rate.

1577
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,520
好吧
Okay.

1578
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,190
那么  打算怎么办
So, what's the plan?

1579
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,110
眼下  是双方各执一词的阶段
Well, right now, it's a "He said, she said."

1580
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,610
-她说的故事比我的好  -不  尼克
- She's telling a better story. - No, Nick.

1581
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,490
她讲诉的故事堪称完美
She is telling the perfect story.

1582
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,020
所以今天我们就要开始
So, we need to start today

1583
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,080
准备你的辩词  如果用得上的话
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1584
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,510
-而如果我们决定采用你的版本  -真相
- And if we decide to go with your version of... - The truth.

1585
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:14,750
那我们需要改变公众对艾米的看法
Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy.

1586
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,040
不能再让他们把她当美国甜心
Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart,

1587
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,450
而是看清她的本质
and see her for what she is,

1588
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,410
一个善于操纵别人思想的人
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1589
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:22,640
现在  这是个浩大的改观工程
Now, that is a huge realignment.

1590
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,790
除你之外  我们还需要其他人的声音
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1591
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,720
必须有一个人
There has to be someone out there

1592
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,100
曾经吃过她苦头的人
that she's screwed with in the past.

1593
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:30,210
有个纽约人  叫汤米·欧哈拉
There's a New York guy. O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1594
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,630
八年前  她起诉过他
Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him.

1595
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,850
那应该很容易找到
That should be easy to find.

1596
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,760
曾经的同学  德西·柯林斯
Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1597
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,690
她说他跟踪过她  他住在圣路易斯
She said that he stalked her. He's in St. Louis.

1598
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,230
你去找汤米  我去起草合同
You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract.

1599
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:51,540
和你说了  你找对人了
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1600
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,950
是的
Apparently.

1601
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,790
汤米
Tommy?

1602
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,390
我是
Yeah.

1603
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,760
-谢谢你来见我  -没事
- Thanks for seeing me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1604
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,560
你需要喝点东西
You're gonna want a drink.

1605
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,440
对
Yeah.

1606
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,260
她说你对她动粗了
So, she said you got physical with her.

1607
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:22,280
不  哥们  她说我强奸她
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1608
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,680
强奸是一级重罪
First degree, felony rape.

1609
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,150
-你做了吗  -你呢
- Did you do it? - Did you do it?

1610
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,410
可能要蹲30年大牢  甚至终身监禁
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1611
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,490
-你有被庭审过吗  -他妈的根本没有
- Did you get a trial? - Fuck, no.

1612
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,740
我看起来像能吃牢饭的人吗
Do I look like I would do well in the yard?

1613
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,700
我做了个辩诉交易  只是性侵  无需入狱
I pled down, man. Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1614
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,790
-那也不是小事  -是啊
- That's something. - Oh, yeah.

1615
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,250
这八年来我都找不到工作
I've been unemployed for the last eight years,

1616
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,160
因为我必须在每一份求职信上
because I have to write

1617
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,800
注明我曾性侵他人
"Sexual offender" on every job application.

1618
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,150
邻里监督组织那里也有我的名字
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,

1619
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,790
因为我不得不报备自己是名危险分子
because I have to register as a predator.

1620
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,720
我快十年没交过女朋友了
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,

1621
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,180
因为只要她们上网搜索我...
because if a girl googles me...

1622
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:54,050
你能和我说说这是怎么回事吗
Could you walk me through what happened?

1623
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:57,470
我在这场派对上认识了艾米
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1624
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,140
我们一拍即合  她很完美
We click. She's perfect.

1625
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:01,510
漂亮  聪明  又博览群书
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's well-read.

1626
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,860
还有二十岁脱衣舞娘的妖娆身材
She's got an ass like a 20-year-old stripper.

1627
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,690
我想  "这里面有什么内幕"
I think, "What's the catch?"

1628
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,900
几个月之后  我才想到  这事不会善了
A few months, it hits me. This is not going to be easy.

1629
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:12,620
女生就像需要修缮的房屋  但是艾米
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1630
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:16,110
我成了她的附属物  她把我当成她的东西
She annexed me. She made me her business.

1631
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,960
有点过分了  她出去给我买领带
It was just too much. She went out and bought me ties.

1632
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,210
我们至少去了二十趟
And we must have gone 20 rounds over that.

1633
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:25,010
就买个领带  这整件事变得...
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1634
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,830
-所以你和她分手  -不  我只是躲着她
- So, you broke up with her. - No, I just backed away.

1635
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,680
给她点空间  没什么大不了  对吧
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1636
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,390
我是这么想的
So I thought.

1637
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,720
后来有天晚上  艾米来我家
Then one night, Amy comes over to my place,

1638
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,680
带了一瓶波旁威士忌和我喜欢的乐队的盗版碟
with a bottle of Bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love.

1639
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,720
不到两分钟  她把我内裤脱了
And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles,

1640
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,360
然后她跪着  然后...
and she is kneeling down, and...

1641
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,390
抱歉  我知道她是你妻子
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1642
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,320
-你们做爱了  -对  两厢情愿的
- You had sex? - Yeah, consensual.

1643
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,450
很激烈  但那是她强烈要求的
It was rough, but she was screaming for it.

1644
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,240
第二天早上  两名警察来敲我的门
Next morning, there's two cops at my door.

1645
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,490
艾米的受伤情况与强奸吻合

手腕上被捆的痕迹  还有我的精液

1647
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:02,410
看起来就像我把艾米绑在床上  强奸了她
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her.

1648
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,910

1649
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,710
然后  猜猜他们找到了什么

1652
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,930

-你后来有见过她吗  -有

1665

为什么呢  诺艾尔  你觉得是为什么呢

01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,550
我想我们都知道原因

这话有点刻薄了
A little harsh.

01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,300
这就是生活啊  宝贝
That's life, baby.

我不是说  他就可以杀害她
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

我只是说  事情是有原因的

1697
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:55,690
真爽
Fuck, yeah.

双胞胎姐弟经常能激发和教唆对方

虽然我没有调查过尼克  或者他姐姐

1723

我从你给我妻子写的信上知道了你的地址

Amy and I believe in the lost art of letter-writing.

1746
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,210
为什么还要保持联系
Everything.

01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,680
在寄宿学校你们交往了两年  对吗

1749
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:12,730
-为什么分手  -真是个奇怪的问题
- Why did you break up? - That's a strange question.

1750
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,720
你对她不好吗  还是背着她有别人了
Did you treat her bad? Did you cheat on her?

1751
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:15,980
这个问题很无礼
That's a rude question.

1752
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,730
我告诉你艾米是怎么和我说的吧
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1753

她甩了你  你完全崩溃了

你跟踪过她  威胁过她

1755
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,410
你曾试图在她床上自杀  被收容治疗

1756
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:30,370
你妻子失踪  你大老远过来就为了说这些吗
Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this?

1757
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:32,620
我以为会听到这个故事的另一个版本
I thought there might be another side to this story.

1758
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:38,130
科林斯先生
Mr. Collings.

1762
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:54,470

我觉得很有意思
It interests me.

1766
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,090
朗达
Hey, Rhonda.

1767
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,040
"他会杀了我"  日记最后这么写了
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1768
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,200
他为什么去他爸爸的房子里烧日记本
Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?

1769
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,370
那是私人房产  而且没有人在
It's private. There's no one there.

1770
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,220
他为什么没有确保日记被完全烧毁
Why didn't he make sure it actually burned?

1771
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,540
因为他触发了警报
Because he tripped the alarm.

1772
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:30,220
你拿着手电筒出现了
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1773
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,600
这整件事透着古怪
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1774
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,730
比如发现写着"线索"的信封
Like finding an envelope marked "Clue."

1775
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,880
你有听过那句话吗
You ever hear the expression,

1776
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,770
"最简单的答案通常是正确的"
"The simplest answer is often the correct one"?

1777
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,480
其实  我一直都不觉得那句话是对的
Actually, I've never found that to be true.

1778
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,320
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

伪造自己的死亡  并嫁祸给我

1792
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,930
她设置了寻宝游戏

1793
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,310
现在寻宝游戏成了关键
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1795
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,020
展示给大家  还变本加厉

她把线索一的卡片留给警察

1797

引他们去我的办公室

1798
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,440
而那正是我和安迪经常私会的地方

1799
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,810
她还在那儿放了一条红色内裤
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1800
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,030
影响你的形象

1807

艾米会看见信用卡账单

1808
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:40,490
那就用安迪的信用卡

安迪的账单会直接传到她爸妈那儿

爸爸的房子是蓝色的

爸妈离婚之后  他不在我们身边
After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around.

1815
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:57,020
我一直都假装他是个间谍  叫布朗先生

1816
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:59,170
为了确保他孩子的安全

在办公室发现了可以让你定罪的红内裤

So, what in God's name is at your father's house,

1823

肯定不是什么好东西
I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.

1830

我们有太多不可控因素

01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,050
尼克  安迪现在是什么态度
Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is?

1832
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,060
守夜之后我们还没联系过
Well, We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1833
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,430
好吧  艾米的父母呢

1834
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,050

你的小女朋友随时都可能把事情公之于众

- No, Andie won't do that. - She will.

1838

这种女孩都会这么做  别感情用事
They always do. Don't take it personally.

1839
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:50,320
艾米巧妙地把我们束缚住了
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1840
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,420
我们得向警察坦白你和安迪的关系
We need to tell the cops about Andie.

1841
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:52,950
不是吧
Really?

1842
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,160
现在安迪的存在让你多了一个杀人动机
Right now, Andie just gives you another motive.

1843
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:57,160
我们还要告诉警察小木屋的事

我们必须主动坦白

1845
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:01,250
但是我要提醒你接下来会发生的事
But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen.

1846
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:03,040
他们会逮捕马尔
They'll go after Margo.

1847
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,080
他们没权这样做  能吗
They can't do that, can they?

1848
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,030
她是你的共犯  帮你隐藏了证据
She's your accomplice. She helped you hide the evidence.

1849
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,160
看起来她知道你杀了艾米
In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy.

1850
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,500
天啊
God.

01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,930

不  其他策略都忽略了重点

But where do they start, Nick?

1857

不知道
I have no idea.

1859

我还以为我们最近对男性敬而远之呢
I thought we were steering clear of men for a while.

1862

他人很好
He's nice.

01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:44,870
因为他想干你
Because he wants to fuck you.

01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,040
她还在为前任而苦恼吗
She's still moping about her ex?

1865
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:52,500
他也被背叛过
He got cheated on, too.

1866
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,750
我们三个是欧扎克最悲伤的人
We three are the saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.

1867
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,340
我不悲伤

我被老婆抛弃那时都要宿醉而死了

别便宜了他
Don't give him the pleasure.

1873
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,980
我想把自己淹死在墨西哥湾

成为大白鲨的美餐

为什么要死的是我  我又不是那个混蛋

应该把这话印在T恤上

土豪小姐  你不是说你破产了吗

应召女郎  还是"口"艺高超

1883

我们逗你玩呢

你收拾得真彻底
Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here.

1930
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,110
桃乐茜真是个细心的人
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1931
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,730
连个挂钩都没留下
Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind.

1932
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,920
我得确保你没落任何东西
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1933
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,410
袜子
A sock...

1934
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:58,130
内衣  或者其他什么
or undies or what have you.

1935
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,290
你清理得真干净
You did a real good job.

1936
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,430
你把钱藏哪了  亲爱的
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1937
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,100
看看她裙子底下
Look under her dress.

1938
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,900
他让你这么干的吗
He talked you into this?

1939
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,260
是我叫他这么干的
I talked him into it.

1940
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,320
你们一走我就报警
The second you leave, I'm calling the cops.

1941
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,480
你的眼镜是假的  头发也是染的
Your glasses are fake. Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1942
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,640
你说你叫南希
You say your name's Nancy,

1943
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,600
但喊你名字你总是没反应
but you don't even answer to it half the time.

1944
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:27,290
你在躲避什么
You're hiding.

1945
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:29,110
我不知道为什么  也不关心这个
I don't know why, and I don't really care.

1946
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:31,190
但是你绝对不会报警
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1947
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,610
而且我觉得你也没被虐待过
And I don't think you've ever really been hit before.

1948
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,830
我靠
Holy shit.

1949
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,680
抱歉  我们真的很需要钱
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1950
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:49,340
下次一定多加小心  明白吗
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1951
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,740
外面有很多比我们还坏的人
There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are.

1952
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,970
抱歉  你不能在这儿睡觉
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1953

{\pos(51.25,205)}七月十二日

1954

1957
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,950
再来一遍吧  别那么愣
Why don't you try it again? A little less wooden.

1958
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,090
我没杀我妻子
I didn't kill my wife.

1959
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,630
-干嘛  -你每次表现得自以为是
- What are you doing? - Every time you look smug,

1960
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,060
生闷气  或者紧张的时候
or annoyed or tense,

1961
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,340
我就拿小熊软糖扔你
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1962
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,570
难道这能缓解我紧绷的神经吗
That's supposed to make me less tense?

1963
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:12,340
我们再来一遍
Let's try it again.

1964
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,050
邓恩先生  据我了解
Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,

1965
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,670
你和你的妻子有些矛盾
you and your wife had some bumps.

1966
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,550
是  我们这几年过得不是很顺利
Yeah, we had some tough years.

1967
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,680
我失业了
I lost my job.

1968
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,720
是你们都失业了
You both did.

1969
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,320

1972
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:33,280

尽量谈你的母亲  说说你们的关系
Let's talk about your mom, how close you were.

1974
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,190
接着说
Go on.

1975
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,750
时间一久  就会积累矛盾
For a while, things had been building up.

1976
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:42,280
"积累"让人感觉要爆发  不能这么说
"Built up" implies that an explosion is coming. No.

1977
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,750
可以说  我们的婚姻走上了错误的轨道
At a certain point, we got on the wrong track.

1978
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,200
我一时懦弱
I had a moment of weakness.

1979
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,660
你的"一时"可是持续了十五个多月

1980
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,560
我对妻子很无礼
I disrespected my wife.

1981
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,640
对婚姻不重视
And I disrespected my marriage.

1982
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,480
我一直都很后悔
And I'll always regret it.

1983
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,050
这话管用
That works.

1984
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,520
别怕表现得像个愚蠢的老公  尼克
Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1985
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,270
我就是个傻瓜  我糟透了
I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1986
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,140
我做的一切都是错的
Everything I do is wrong."

1987
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:09,240
我懂男人都需要怎么做
I know. What men are supposed to do in general.

1988
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,410
-谢了  -你感觉怎么样

感觉不错  能递给我那个盒子吗
I feel good. Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1992
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,860

01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:23,910
就像我喜欢这条领带
Just like I love this tie.

1994
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:27,080
就像我爱我的妻子
Just like I love my wife.

01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:12,660
我威胁他说我要离开
I threatened to leave,

2003
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:15,710
他说要找到我并且杀了我
and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me.

2004
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:18,220
所以我才消失掉
So, I disappeared.

2005
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,210
我流产了
I lost the baby.

2006
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,510
我甚至都不敢告诉父母
I couldn't even tell my parents.

2007
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,480
我感到很羞耻  也很害怕
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

2008
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:29,400
他在找你
Well, he is looking for you.

2009
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,020
三天前他来过我家
He showed up on my doorstep three days ago.

2010
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,560
他看见我给你的信就找过来了
He tracked me from my letters to you.

2011
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:36,900
你还留着那些信
You saved them.

2012
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:38,530
你的存在
Knowing you were out there,

2013
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:41,190
是这几年来唯一支撑我的事
was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years.

2014
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,620
我们报警吧  你可以说明一切

不  我现在不能露面

我会很难堪  人人都会瞧不起我
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

2017
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,200
我想让尼克蹲监狱是不是错了
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

2018
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:53,090
他应该为他所做的进监狱
He should go to prison for what he's done.

2019
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,380
我把你安顿在我的湖边小屋

What the fuck?

我叫安迪·菲茨杰拉德

我在学校认识了尼古拉斯·邓恩
I met Nicholas dunne,

2048
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:57,320
他是我的创意写作老师
when he was my creative writing teacher at Mill Valley.

2049
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,450
她为什么穿得像个保姆
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

2050
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,940
我非常惭愧
I am deeply ashamed...

2051
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:04,120
与已婚男人发展恋爱关系
of having been romantically involved with a married man.

2052
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,080
这个大胸骚货
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

2053
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:08,120
我以为我们是真爱
I truly believed we were in love.

2054
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,000
现在开始装圣女了
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

2055
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:12,960
我知道这种事没有借口
I know that is no excuse.

2056
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,300
对  没借口
No, it is not.

2057
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,780
在我心里
I do not, in my heart,

2058
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:18,670
我不认为尼克·邓恩会为我而杀人
believe Nick Dunne would have killed for me.

2059
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:21,130
我为每个关心艾米的人祈祷

我为给他们带来的伤害而道歉

但从今往后 恩断义绝
That love ended today.

2063
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:35,470
走吧  他们看起来很不好
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

2064
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,180
他用无尽的谎言回报我们的信任
He met our trust with lie after lie.

2065
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,440
我们现在坚定地相信
We now absolutely believe,

2066
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,860
尼克与我们女儿的失踪有很大关系
Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter.

2067
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,150
我们的了不起的艾米

真是个劲爆的消息
Well, this just got very exciting.

2069
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:50,580
我们需要点时间
We need a moment.

2070
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,340
我们得取消访谈
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

2071
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:56,170
-什么都没变  -一切都变了
- Nothing has changed. - Everything has changed.

2072
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:56,810
一小时之间
An hour ago,

2073
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:58,630
我们还掌握主动权  现在呢
we were ahead of this. Now?

2074
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:00,310
-我能处理好  -我们是被动的
- I can handle this. - We're on the defense.

2075
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:02,390
现在的事态完全不同了
This is a completely different dynamic.

2076
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,170
-我能处理好  -她能活剥了你

不仅向我们披露他妻子失踪的内幕

01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,870
你杀了你妻子吗  尼克

01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:16,010
我没有杀我妻子

2177
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,210
我不是杀人犯
I am not a murderer.

2178
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:20,180
但是你出轨了
But you were unfaithful.

2179
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,430
我是出轨了
I was unfaithful.

2180
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:24,140
我也感到很羞愧
And I am deeply ashamed.

2181
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,520
更严重的是  你让艾米的父母
And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents,

2182
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:29,560
她的朋友  以及你镇上的所有人

相信你是个忠诚的丈夫

2186
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,640
说是这么说  不过我很好奇
You say that, but I'm wondering,

2187
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,480
你要怎么让我们相信你
how you expect us to believe you.

2188
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:41,240
我们现在知道你是个骗子
Now that we know you're a liar.

2189
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:44,660
我之前没承认自己有外遇
I didn't come forward with my affair.

2190
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,870
因为我知道  这会让我看起来坏得无可救药

2191
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,490
但我已经不在乎了

我只是想找到我的妻子

01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:54,760
-我只是想搞清楚  -让我给你说清楚
- I'm just trying to get clear... - let me be clear.

2194
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:59,210
我虽然不是个杀人犯  我也不是个好人
Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy.

2195
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:00,430
我不是个好人
I'm not a good guy.

2196
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,300
我是一位好妻子的坏丈夫
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

2197
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,430
我打破了对她的誓言
I broke the vow that I made to her.

2198
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:08,230
说得真好  尼克
Those are pretty words, Nick.

2199
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,310
但这对你来说到底意味着什么
But what does that really mean to you?

2200
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:12,390
我是个彻头彻尾的骗子
It basically means that I was a con artist.

2201
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:16,560
七年前  我遇到艾米·艾略特
I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.

2202

我完全被迷住了
I was completely transfixed.

2203
01:52:18,650 --> 01:52:20,560
艾米非常迷人
Amy can do that to you.

2204
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:23,150
我只是一个普通的男人
I was this average guy from an average place.

2205
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
怀揣着一丝梦想
with mediocre aspirations.

2206
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:27,740
我遇到了一个让我为之倾倒的女人
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

2207
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,740
我希望得到她的爱
And I wanted her to love me.

2208
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:32,130
所以我假装自己很优秀
So I pretended to be better than I was.

2209
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,670
在我们结婚时  我承诺会成为那样的人
When we got married, I promised to be that guy.

2210
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:38,540
一个勤奋工作的人
That guy who works harder.

2211
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:40,800
一个跟她一样  努力向上
That guy who, who lives and acts,

2212
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:43,760
用尽全力去爱的人
and loves with as much passion as she does.

2213
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:45,220
但我让她失望了
But I failed her.

2214
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:47,500
我没有正确处理事情
Instead of doing what was right.

2215
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,930
我选择了逃避
I did what was easy.

2216
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,310
你说得好像你的妻子能起死回生
You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife.

2217
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:55,970
还活着似的
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2218
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:57,310
她的确还活着
She is still alive.

2219
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:02,020
你能看着镜头吗
Will you look at that camera for me?

2220
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,320
看着镜头
Will you look in the lens,

2221
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,320
跟你的妻子说话
and talk to your wife?

2222
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,460
如果她依然活着  能看到你今晚的采访
If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight.

2223
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:13,160
你会对她说什么  尼克
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2224
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:19,010
艾米  我爱你
Amy, I love you.

2225
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:22,500
你是我见过最棒的人
You're the best person I've ever known.

2226

2227
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:27,020
感到无比后悔
woodshed for the way that I've treated you.

2228
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,010
如果你能回来  我保证
And if you come back, I promise,

2229
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:31,550
我会花一辈子的时间去弥补你
I will spend every day making it up to you.

2230
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:35,900
我会成为我承诺的完美男人
I will be the man that I promised you I would be.

2231
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,480
我爱你
I love you.

2232
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,990
回家吧
Come home.

2233
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,740
给我
Here.

2234
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:55,490
不管你怎么想
Regardless of what you thought,

2235
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:57,710
怎么样
What does it say?

2236
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:59,300
我想我们都同意
I think we can all agree,

2237
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,830
天啊  你太厉害了
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2238
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,050
事情远远没那么简单
there's more to him than meets the eye.

2239
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,210
他们都为你疯狂
They're going crazy for you.

2240
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:07,710
他们从不喜欢我  喜欢我  恨我
They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me,

2241
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,390
变成了爱我
and now they love me.

2242
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:12,390
坦诚的人值得尊重
A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect.

2243
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:14,340
很显然  他赢得了我的尊重
He's certainly earned mine.

2244
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,260
怎么了
What is it?

2245
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,270
我是莎伦·希伯  晚安
I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.

2246
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,990
马尔·邓恩  这是搜查令
Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant for your property.

2247
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:32,240
我通常会忽略爆料电话
I usually ignore tipline calls.

2248
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,150
但有邻居看到陌生男子
But a neighbor was concerned

2249
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:36,870
在你的小木屋附近游荡
about a strange man around your woodshed.

2250
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:38,290
打给坦纳
Call Tanner.

2251
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:39,460
该死的
Okay. Fuck!

2252
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:45,050
你的女朋友很可爱  尼克
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2253
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:47,380
是因为这件事吗
Is that what this is about?

2254
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,300
整个调查中
I have treated you more than fair

2255
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:53,550
我都对你很公平
throughout this entire investigation.

2256
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,900
我一次又一次给你机会坦白
I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over.

2257
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:57,430
每次你说了愚蠢的话
Every time you said something stupid.

2258
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,860
我就想  他只是蠢而已
I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."

2259
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:02,440
但我错了  事情原来是这样的
But I was wrong. That's what this is about.

2260
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,600
这些就是你不用的高尔夫球杆吗
Are these the clubs you don't play golf with?

2261
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:04,650
那些全都不是我的
None of that is mine.

2262
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,520
也不是我放在这里的
None of this was put here by me.

2263
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:07,920
很不错的球杆
Those are nice clubs.

2264
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,120
好一个男人的密室
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2265
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,290
就等着妻子永远消失了
Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good.

2266
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:14,410
尼克
Nick!

2267
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:18,580
-你们不能这样做  -我们当然可以
- You can't do that! - Of course we can.

2268
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,460
艾米  是时候重新开始了
Amy, it's time to move on.

2269
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:31,220
我有什么能帮忙的吗
What can I do to help?

2270
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:33,480
我需要时间考虑
I need some time to think.

2271
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:36,010
-这是你最不需要的  -德西
- That's the last thing you need. - Desi.

2272
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,650
二十年来  你一直让我等
Twenty years, you have kept me dangling.

2273
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:42,350
你昨晚终于来见我了  你选择了我
Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me.

2274
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,390
跟着昨晚的直觉走
Follow that instinct.

2275
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:46,600
不要再让自己挨打
Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten,

2276
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,570
睡在车里无家可归  担惊受怕
and homeless, sleeping in your car, fearing for your life.

2277
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:56,620
我不会强迫你
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2278
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,710
你说的我都懂  德西
I understand what you're saying, Desi.

2279
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,590
我真的懂
I do.

2280
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:10,580
我被长时间虐待
Just been... I've been so mistreated for so long.

2281
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:15,470
都忘了如何处事
I've forgotten how to behave.

2282
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:23,530
我明天会搬进来
I'll move in here tomorrow.

2283
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,140
我们一起想办法解决
And we'll work it out together.

2284
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:31,940
我只想要你做回自己
I just want you to be you again.

2285
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:41,310
他们抓走马尔是为了吓唬你
They only took Margo to fuck with you.

2286
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:43,040
我不能让她在那里多待一秒
She's not spending another fucking second in there.

2287
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,830
我要进去告诉他们真相
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2288
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,250
怎么了
What?

2289
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:51,890
我们只能跟邦妮透漏一点
We tell Boney very little.

2290
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:54,050
没有尸体  没有凶器
Without a body, without a murder weapon.

2291
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,380
他们只能期望你认罪
Their only hope is a confession.

2292
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:58,390
把说话权让给他们
So, you let them do all the talking.

2293
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:00,550
那我们就有时间组织你的辩词
That way, we can jump-start your defense.

2294
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,980
真相就是我的辩词
The truth is my defense.

2295
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:09,940
认得它们吗
Recognize these?

2296
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,060
艾米送我的周年纪念日礼物
Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2297
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:13,900
她是通过这些告诉你她怀孕的吗  尼克
Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick?

2298
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:16,450
妈妈爸爸孩子  这就让你生气了吗
Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad?

2299
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:18,120
不

2300
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:21,490
-认得这个吗  -从未见过
- Recognize this? - Never seen that before in my life.

2301

这是艾米的日记  在你爸爸家里找到的
It's Amy's diary. We found this at your father's house.

2302
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,260
这是你妻子的笔迹吗
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2303
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:30,290
-他又不是鉴定专...  -看上去是
- He's not a handwriting ex... - looks like it.

2304
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:31,470
我们的专家也这样认为
Our experts thought so, too.

2305
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,940
我们来玩个是真还是假的游戏
Do you wanna play a little true or false?

2306
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:36,470
没问题
Sure.

2307
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:40,980
"他抹掉我嘴唇上的糖霜  吻了我"
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me."

2308
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:44,110
真的
Yeah, that's true.

2309
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,350
你还以为藜麦是种鱼
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2310
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,990
这也是真的
That is also true, yes.

2311
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:54,270
她想要孩子  你攻击了她
She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her.

2312
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,330
我打了她  从来没有
I hit her? No, never happened.

2313
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,980
-这里说的是推  -完全没有
- "Pushed," It says "Pushed." - Absolutely not.

2314
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:59,110
我从来没碰过她
I never touched her.

2315
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:03,170
她试图去买枪
She tried to buy a gun.

2316
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:05,710
不会吧  不过我也不知道
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2317
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,750
我要读下最后一句吗
Shall I read the last entry?

2318
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,830
读吧
Sure.

2319
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:13,260
"这男人可能会杀了我"
"This man may kill me."

2320
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:15,510
她的原话  "这男人可能会杀了我"
In her own words, "This man may kill me."

2321
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:17,680
就是个简单的尾注罢了
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2322
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,600
以备日后参考
For future reference.

2323
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,970
记住  你不是笔迹鉴定专家
The truth, you are not a handwriting expert.

2324
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,070
我知道了
Okay, I know.

2325
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:39,330

我们第一天在你家办公室的壁炉里找到的
We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office.

2328

2329
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:48,670
但七月里生火吗
but fire in July?

2330

我们把它包了起来
We bagged it.

2331

我也从未见过
I've never seen that before either.

01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:53,370
我们验过了  火是抹不去血迹的  尼克

我想你了
I've missed you.

我一直在想
I've been thinking...

2378
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:27,110
我不能离开你
I don't wanna be without you.

2379
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:30,160
留下来陪我
Stay with me.

2380
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,530
这一切结束后
And when all this dies down,

2381
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,160
按你说的  我们去希腊
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2382
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,500
章鱼和拼字游戏吗
Octopus and scrabble?

2383
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,750
你觉得离结束还有多久呢
How long do you think until it's done?

2384
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:41,640
不久了  六个月的庭审
Not long. Six months for the trials.

2385
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,380
判决很快的
Sentencing will be quick.

2386
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,970
他会上诉的
He'll appeal.

2387
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,130
其他的我可以在国外看
I can watch the rest overseas.

2388
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:05,810
慢点来
Go slowly.

2389
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:06,860
我就想要
But I want it.

2390
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:28,790
别急
Don't rush.

2391
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:30,930
上我吧
Just do it.

2392
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:40,930
再快点
Harder.

2393
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:40,220
{\pos(50.5,205)}八月四日

2394
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:41,090
{\pos(41.5,239)}失踪

2395
02:05:37,210 --> 02:05:41,090
{\pos(67.75,239)}三十天后

2396
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:22,660
你个婊子
You fucking bitch.

2397
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:35,010
别担心  你们还会有很多小孩的
Don't you worry, you're gonna have lots of babies.

2398
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:40,130
她的伤口是被强奸导致的  有精液残留
Her wounds are consistent with rape. There was semen present.

2399
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,340
我们会确保找到匹配者
We'll make sure it's a match.

2400
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:43,100
会找到的
Yeah, it'll match.

2401
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:45,610
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

2402
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:47,140
你怎么看
What do you think?

2403
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:48,480
咱俩又成好友啦
Are we pals again?

2404
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:52,060
我知道你没杀你的妻子  所以是的
Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2405
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:53,110
你怎么看
What do you think?

2406
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:56,030
绑架  这故事太扯了
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2407
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,660
她吃了好多止痛药
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2408
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,620
没关系  我想帮忙
It's okay. I want to help.

2409
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:04,080
邓恩女士  我知道你受了不少苦
Ms. Dunne, I know what you've been through

2410
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:06,460
所以我们会尽量简短
so we'll keep this very brief.

2411
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,880
你能给我们讲一下事发经过吗
Can you walk us through what happened?

2412
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,120
那天早晨我听到门铃响
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2413
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:17,010
很正常
So normal.

2414
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:18,890
于是我打开了门
I opened the door.

2415
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:21,350
好奇怪
So strange.

2416
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:25,590
从高中起  他就不肯放过我
Since high school, he won't ever go away.

2417
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:28,720
而我只是不想伤害他
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2418
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:30,400
于是我给他回信
Answer his letters.

2419
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:32,650
让他保持冷静
Keep him calm.

2420
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:35,530
天啊
Oh, my God.

2421
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:37,770
是我鼓励了他的行为
I've encouraged him.

2422
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:39,620
你不能怪自己
You can't blame yourself.

2423
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:43,410
他推开门进了屋
He pushed inside.

2424
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:47,030
然后就抓住我
And he grabbed me.

2425
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:50,840
但我挣脱了  跑到了厨房
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2426
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:52,880
他用棒子打我
And he clubbed me.

2427
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,760
我跌倒了
I collapsed.

2428
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,850
那根棍子实际上是一个潘趣和朱迪玩偶的手柄
That club was actually the handle to a Punch and Judy puppet.

2429
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,300
没错
Right.

2430
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:02,640
寻宝游戏
Treasure hunt.

2431
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,600
我在马尔家藏了一些玩偶
I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...

2432
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,360
那这个手柄怎么会落在德西手里呢
Then how did Desi have that handle?

2433
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:12,150
是我随手抓到的
I'd just found it.

2434
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:15,320
它肯定是掉下来了
It must have fallen off.

2435
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:19,350
德西推门闯进来时我正抓着它
I was holding it when Desi pushed in.

2436
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:20,900
所以他是从我那抢的
So, he got it from me.

2437
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,160
关于那个小木屋...
About that woodshed...

2438
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,870
他把我带到他的湖边小屋
He took me to his lake house.

2439
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:26,160
把我绑到他的床上
Tied me to his bed.

2440
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,740
再说一下那个小木屋  很快  很快
Back to the woodshed real quick. Real quick.

2441
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:30,630
你去那里放玩偶的时候
When you went to place the puppets there,

2442
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:32,060
有没有注意到那个棚屋很满
did you notice that it was packed...

2443
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,240
里面好多东西
Lots of stuff.

2444
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:34,930
都是用你丈夫名下的信用卡
Corresponding to purchases

2445
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:37,710
买来的东西
made on credit cards in your husband's name.

2446
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:39,250
尼克和他的信用卡
Nick and credit cards.

2447
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:41,850
他买东西  我唠叨  我不知道  也许吧
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2448
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:43,500
他在马尔家藏了很多东西
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.

2449
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:44,670
他们俩很亲近
They're very close.

2450
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:49,550
我现在可以继续讲我被一个
Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner

2451
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:52,360
有精神病史的人囚禁的事了吗
by a man with a history of mental problems?

2452
02:08:52,390 --> 02:08:53,470
请继续  邓恩女士
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

2453
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:59,850
德西当晚侵犯了我
Desi assaulted me that night.

2454
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:02,660
晚晚如此
Every night.

2455
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:06,190
他把我像狗一样绑着
He tied me up like a dog.

2456
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:10,080
然后他就惩罚我
And then, he'd punish me.

2457
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,050
饿着我
Starve me.

2458
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:17,250
给我除毛
Shave me.

2459
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,840
鸡奸我
Sodomize me.

2460
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,460
他家到处都是摄像头
There were cameras everywhere.

2461
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:26,470
请找出来  请把录像带找出来
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2462
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:31,350
她用开箱刀割了他的喉咙
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2463
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:34,640
如果她一直被他绑着
How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter,

2464
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:37,280
那她是怎么拿到开箱刀的呢
if he had her tied up the whole time?

2465
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:40,270
你就不能为你妻子安全回家而开心吗
Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe?

2466
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:43,030
艾米  我们找到了你的日记
Amy, we found your diary.

2467
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:44,690
里面你多次指控
It contains many concerning

2468
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:47,160
你丈夫对你进行精神和身体上的虐待
allegations of mental and physical abuse.

2469
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:50,080
这就是丑恶的真相
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2470
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:52,410
尼克不想要孩子
Nick didn't want a baby.

2471
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:57,550
他脾气大  我们还有经济问题
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2472
02:09:58,460 --> 02:09:59,580
但我爱他
But I love him.

2473
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:01,380
那你为什么要买枪呢
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2474
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,420
对不起  我觉得我要晕了
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2475
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:07,310
请再让我问清楚一件事
If I could just clarify one thing...

2476
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:10,550
如果这个案子一直交给你这么无能的人
If this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands

2477
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,480
我丈夫肯定早就被判了死刑
my husband would be on death row,

2478
02:10:12,770 --> 02:10:16,520
而我肯定还被绑在床上呢
and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle.

2479
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:20,480
邓恩女士  您很勇敢  我们问完了
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave. We're finished.

2480
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,530
现在  我得问你
Now, I have to ask you

2481

你觉得和你丈夫回家安全吗
do you feel safe going home with your husband?

2482
02:10:38,830 --> 02:10:41,460
我们向上帝祈祷  上帝回应了我们的祷告

心怀感激
and just be thankful

2487
02:10:48,130 --> 02:10:52,010
感激降临在密西西比的这一奇迹

好了  你可以不用再装了
All right, you can stop pretending now.

我没装啊
I'm not pretending.

你很完美
You were perfect.

2493
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:08,000
电视上的尼克正是我当初爱上的那人
The Nick I saw on TV, that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2494
02:12:08,050 --> 02:12:08,970
你知道我只是
You do know I was just

2495
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:10,760
故意拣你想听的说  对吧
telling you what you wanted to hear, right?

2496

这证明你有多了解我

你得告诉我到底发生了什么

2500
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,810
把衣服脱了
Take off your clothes.

02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:27,520
我得确定你没带窃听器

2502
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:44,830
你杀了人  艾米  你是个杀人犯

我是个斗士

我要走了
I'm leaving.

2515
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,540
