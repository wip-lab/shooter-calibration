21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,740
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,540
这不可能
That's impossible.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,790
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,900
六点了
Six o'clock

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,320
谢谢  黛西
Thank you, Daisy.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,490
安娜
Anna.

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
炉火还旺吗？
Is your fire still in?

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,630
是的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,540
仆人们的早餐摆好了吗？
Have you laid the servant's hall breakfast?

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,380
好了  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,220
是的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,990
卧室的炉火呢？
What about the bedroom fires?

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,850
都生好了  帕特莫太太
All lit, Mrs Patmore.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,380
我说你迟了就是迟了
You're late when I say you're late.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,410
你早晚都得习惯的
You'll have to get used to it sooner or later.

58
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,460
好的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

59
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,060
早膳已备好  卡森先生
Breakfast is ready, Mr Carson.

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,700
书房收拾妥当了吗？
Is the library tidy?

64
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,270
收拾好了  休斯太太
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,360
很好  今天要彻底打扫餐厅
Good. I want the dining room given a proper going over today.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,280
他们用完早餐  你们就开始
You can do it when they've finished their breakfast.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
很好
Very well.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
赶紧回厨房  免得被人瞧见
get back down to the kitchens before anyone sees you.

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,110
好的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,700
世事无常
Nothing in life is sure.

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,850
早安  卡森  
Good morning, Carson.

98
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,310
早安  老爷
Good morning, my lord.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,230
他们所言当真 ？ 
Is it true what they're saying?

100
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,980
我想是的  老爷
I believe so, my lord.

101
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,070
恐怕船上还有我们认识的人
I'm afraid we'll know some people on it.

105
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,120
上帝保佑那些下等舱的可怜人儿
God help the poor devils below decks.

110
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,020
船上有熟人吗？
Do we know anyone on board?

111
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,270
你妈妈认识阿斯特一家  至少认识他本人
Your mother knows the Astors, at least she knows him.

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,610
我们上个月还和罗斯小姐共进晚餐
We dined with Lady Rothes last month.

114
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,200
我原以为它永不沉没
I thought it was supposed to be unsinkable.

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,780
没有高不可攀的山峰
Every mountain is unclimbable until someone climbs it,

116
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,990
没有永不翻沉的船
every ship is unsinkable until it sinks.

122
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,860
我能进来吗？
May I come in?

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,310
他们在乘客名单上
They're on the passenger list.

138
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,500
你得告诉玛丽
You must tell Mary.

140
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,640
两个都没被救上来  他是这么说的
Neither of them were picked up, that's what he said.

142
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,850
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

147
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,980
卡劳利先生是老爷的堂兄
Mr Crawley was his lordship's cousin

149
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,540
我以为玛丽小姐才是继承人
I thought Lady Mary was the heir.

150
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,800
她是个女孩  傻丫头
She's a girl, stupid.

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,410
女孩不能做继承人
Girls can't inherit.

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,190
但现在卡劳利先生已故
But now Mr Crawley's dead

155
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,340
您好
Hello.

157
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,010
那你就推门而入了？
So you pushed in?

162
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,700
我是安娜  女仆领班
I'm Anna, the head housemaid.

167
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,640
不必担心  我自能应对
Don't worry about that, I can manage.

169
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,190
好了  休斯太太
All right, Mrs Hughes,

170
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,690
我来负责这里  谢谢
I'll take over. Thank you.

171
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,110
早上好  贝茨先生  欢迎
Good morning, Mr Bates. Welcome.

173
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,280
我是唐顿庄园的管家  我叫卡森
I am the butler of Downton. My name is Carson.

175
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,990
这位是托马斯  第一男仆
This is Thomas, first footman.

184
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,580
托马斯  领贝茨先生入住
Thomas, take Mr Bates to his room,

185
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,770
带他去看看工作的地方
show him where he'll be working.

186
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,070
多谢各位
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,620
我不觉得这长久得了
I can't see that lasting long.

191
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,040
难道是说我必须戴重孝吗？
Does this mean I'll have to go into full mourning?

192
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,750
我的堂兄和侄子几乎已确定遇难
My first cousin and his son are almost certainly dead.

193
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,490
我们全家都得服丧  
We'll all be in mourning.

194
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,760
不  我是说那件事
No, I mean with the other thing.

209
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,860
这些是舞会用的
These for a ball,

213
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,570
鼻烟壶  他收集的
Snuff boxes, he collects them.

217
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,080
可没有一件属于我们  不是吗？
But none of it's ours, is it?

222
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,440
下次别再犯同样的错
Don't make the same mistake next time.

223
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,280
谁知还会不会有下次？
Who says there'll be a next time?

225
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,830
她显然是不愿意服丧
She was certainly reluctant to go into mourning.

241
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
不知这次我又做错了什么
I wonder what I've done wrong this time.

245
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,640
我不太确定他能否胜任这份工作
I'm not entirely sure that he'll prove equal to the task.

246
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,010
但这由老爷您决定
But your lordship will be the judge of that.

258
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,800
他像极了他母亲
He was too like his mother

263
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,970
你知道新继承人吗  ？
Do you know the new heir?

266
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,740
我记得我从没见过他
I have never to my knowledge set eyes on him.

269
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,420
亲爱的  我来此并非为了争执
My dear, I didn't come here to fight.

271
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,420
他从未料想到你没生下子嗣
It never occurred to him that you wouldn't have a son.

273
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,470
但如果帕特里克能够迎娶玛丽
But when Patrick had married Mary

276
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,270
可不幸的是  现在
Unfortunately, now...

277
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,020
现在一个陌生人将有权处置我的财产
Now, a complete unknown has the right to pocket my money

279
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,740
问题是保住你的嫁妆  庄园就会破产
The problem is, saving your dowry would break up the estate.

280
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
那会毁掉罗伯特这辈子苦心经营的一切
It would be the ruin of everything Robert's given his life to.

295
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,770
唐顿是一所了不起的庄园  贝茨先生
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates.

297
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,760
我们日常起居有规有矩
We live by certain standards

304
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,780
我明白
I know.

305
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,660
贝茨  我的老朋友
Bates, my dear fellow.

307
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,540
我应该想到你们正在用午餐
I should have realised you'd all be at luncheon.

308
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,820
没关系  老爷 
Not at all, my lord.

310
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,790
我只想来跟老战友打个招呼
I just want to say a quick hello to my old comrade in arms.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
贝茨  我的兄弟  欢迎来到唐顿
Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

312
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,840
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

313
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,350
很抱歉打扰各位  请原谅
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all. Please forgive me.

314
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,560
你们从没问过
You never asked.

326
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,730
哀伤总是让人又饿又累
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired than grief.

330
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,280
那之后你感觉好些吗？
Did it make you feel better?

331
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,740
没什么用  可它能打发时间
Not much, but it passed the time.

343
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,810
没有遗体我们没办法举行葬礼
We could hardly have held a funeral without the bodies.

353
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,230
我只做了一点调查
I've only made a few inquiries,

355
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,990
马修·卡劳利是一名律师
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor

357
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,590
曼彻斯特？
Manchester?

358
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,720
他的专长是公司法
His special field is company law.

359
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,180
母亲健在  和他住在一起
His mother is alive and he lives with her.

361
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,560
我知道了
I know.

362
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,130
这真够古怪的
It does seem odd

365
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,990
的确如此
Indeed.

366
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,070
帮个忙  
Do me a favour.

367
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,620
这个应该撒在鸡肉上
This is supposed to be sprinkled on the chicken.

369
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,580
求你了  用不了几分钟
please, it won't take a moment.

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,470
我们该谈谈限定继承权的事情
We ought to talk about the business of the entail.

375
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,020
是的
Yes.

386
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,450
我懂了
I see.

391
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,670
那你就该羞愧
Then you should be ashamed.

399
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,240
黛西  是你吗？
Daisy, is that you?

416
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,870
谢谢你  莫里
Thank you, Murray.

417
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,700
你的建议我会考虑
You've given me a good deal to think about.

418
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,300
玛丽  请大家进餐厅
Mary, try to get everyone into the dining room.

419
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,790
伊迪丝  请敏特里老爷坐下
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne sits down.

439
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,030
你可曾想过另一种生活吗？
Do you ever wish you'd gone another way?

443
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,130
不知道  可能有点
I don't know. Maybe.

451
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,980
太不公平了
It's iniquitous.

456
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,110
贝茨干得怎么样？
How's Bates working out?

476
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,220
没问题
It's not a problem.

479
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,390
托马斯
Thomas.

485
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,340
他们从教堂回来  路上就谈完了
They talked it all through on the way back from the church.

507
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,330
妈妈说下个月我们可以改半丧
Mama says we can go into half-mourning next month.

512
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,510
实在没得选了我才会嫁给他
I was only going to marry him if nothing better turned up.

520
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,000
他连老爷的箱子都差点提不动
He can hardly manage His Lordship's cases.

528
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,890
我想您不愿看到
I don't believe you'd like to think

535
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,120
你真贴心
You're a darling.

538
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,130
谢谢
Thank you.

547
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,500
怀念部队里的日子吗  贝茨？
Do you miss the army, Bates?

567
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,820
你不觉得隐瞒实情是很不诚实的吗？
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest not to mention it?

569
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,200
你知道我不愿对此多谈
You know I don't care to talk about all that.

577
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,050
我完全理解你想帮助他的初衷
I fully see why you want to help him.

581
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,390
我只是想给他个机会
I just want to give him a chance.

582
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,900
妈妈  抱歉  我不知您来此
Mama, I'm sorry, no one told me you were here.

587
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,500
它非常方便
It's very convenient.

598
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,270
消息传得真快  
News travels fast.

604
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,040
说真的  妈妈  你我心知肚明
Really, Mama, you know as well as I do

623
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,800
你难道不在乎唐顿吗？
Don't you care about Downton?

624
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,510
您觉得呢？
What do you think?

625
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,850
我这一生的精力都倾注在唐顿庄园上
I've given my life to Downton.

626
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,310
我生于斯  也希望死于斯
I was born here and I hope to die here.

629
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,360
我在乎它吗？  我当然在乎！
Do I care about it? Yes, I do care!

630
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,820
你们不会是在争执吧
I hope I don't hear sounds of a disagreement.

633
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,870
很高兴总算有人想起来抗争一下了
I'm glad somebody's putting up a fight.

637
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,050
晚餐已经准备好了  夫人
Dinner is served, my lady.

638
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,220
还有谁也一直梦见泰坦尼克号吗？
Does anyone else keep dreaming about the Titanic?

639
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,810
我老是梦见它  
I can't get it out of my mind.

640
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,600
不是吧  消停会吧
Not again. Give it a rest.

641
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,140
黛西  别再想这件事了
Daisy, it is time to let it go.

645
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,820
您在南非肯定见过更惨的吧  贝茨先生？
I expect you saw worse things in South Africa, Mr. Bates?

646
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,860
谈不上更惨  但也够坏
Not worse, but pretty bad.

647
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,320
你很享受战争吗？
Did you enjoy the war?

648
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,020
我想没人享受战争
I don't think anyone enjoys war,

649
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,950
但也有些不错的回忆
but there are some good memories, too.

650
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,450
我也确信肯定是有的
I'm sure there are.

651
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,410
贝茨先生  您能把那个托盘递给我吗？
Mr. Bates, would you hand me that tray?

653
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,630
抱歉
Sorry.

655
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,010
老爷带着葡萄酒进了书房
The Lordship's taken his port to the library.

656
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,760
安娜  格温  上楼帮忙收拾去
Anna, Gwen, go up and help clear away.

659
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,730
我老是记不住
I keep forgetting.

660
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,950
这个是要放到隔壁还是拿回厨房？
Does this go next door or back to the kitchen?

665
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,670
什么事？
What is it?

699
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,110
我觉得你很美   
I think you look beautiful.

700
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,570
谢谢你  茜玻  亲爱的
Thank you, Sybil darling.

701
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,600
咱们该下楼了
We should go down.

702
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,080
他们随时都会从车站回来
They'll be back from the station at any moment.

705
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,420
你们都准备好了吗？
You all ready?

706
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,470
很好  大家出门迎接客人吧
Very well. You should go out to greet them.

711
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,180
我想出去  卡森先生
I want to go, Mr. Carson.

713
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,140
我很乐意去
I'd like to be there.

717
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,070
我来帮你吧
I'll give you a hand.

722
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,240
欢迎光临唐顿庄园
Welcome to Downton.

731
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,010
格兰瑟姆夫人  我有个不情之请
Lady Grantham, I've a confession to make,

739
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,610
我记得这个人
I remember this man.

747
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,460
贝茨  你没事吧？  
Bates, are you all right?

748
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,380
很好  老爷  对不起
Perfectly, my Lord. I apologise.

749
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,060
贝茨先生
Mr. Bates.

759
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,870
我不知道  
I don't know.

763
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,110
不  别告诉你母亲
No, don't tell your mama.

766
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,200
我只是不想有人来打扰我们
I'm only worried the others will want to join us.

774
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,360
什么事情？
What things?

775
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,160
不过是军队的晚宴而已
It's just a regimental dinner.

779
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,130
我不管卡森怎么想
I don't care what Carson thinks.

781
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,140
她说她不来喝茶了
She says she won't come to tea,

787
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,360
不管怎样  真是难为你了
It must be so difficult for you, all the same.

788
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,870
不要多事
Don't stir.

800
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,970
这是你父亲的房子  不是吗？
It's your father's house, isn't it?

801
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,930
你有权利知道房子里的一切
You've a right to know what goes on in it.

802
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,140
这通向哪儿？
Where does this lead?

810
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,800
有人来了！
Someone's coming!

811
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,680
能效劳吗  小姐？
Can I help you, my lady?

812
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,310
我们只是随便看看
We were just exploring.

813
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,650
您是要找托马斯吗  大人？
Were you looking for Thomas, Your Grace?

814
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,990
不  如玛丽小姐所说 我们只是随便看看
No, as Lady Mary said, we've just been exploring.

815
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,370
那您想看看我的房间吗  小姐？
Would you care to explore my room, my lady?

816
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,330
不用了  贝茨  很抱歉打扰你了
Of course not, Bates. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

817
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,500
我们马上就下去
We were just going down.

818
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,630
为什么要向那个人道歉？
Why did you apologise to that man?

819
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,680
他无权干涉我们
It's not his business what we do.

821
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,900
这是我的习惯
It's a habit of mine.

832
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,730
这么说你心意已决？
So you're quite determined?

835
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,730
别担心  卡森
Don't worry, Carson.

874
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,200
我不能要您的钱  老爷
I couldn't take your money, my lord.

888
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,600
下午您和玛丽在小阁楼做什么呢？
What were you and Mary doing in the attics this afternoon?

897
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,000
我们就是随处参观
We were just looking around.

905
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,490
是的  卡森管家
Yes, Mr Carson.

916
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,520
你在干什么  安娜？
What are you doing, Anna?

924
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,640
我不明白他为什么要走
I don't see why he has to go.

926
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,050
这不是你能决定的
It's not up to you.

935
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,850
以你的为人  总能找到容身之处
There's always a place for a man like you.

949
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,000
一夜之间  失去两位继承人  太可怕了
To lose two heirs in one night, it's terrible.

963
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,810
您要放弃所有家产吗？
You'll give up your entire estate?

984
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,130
玛丽小姐是位迷人的女士
Lady Mary is a charming person.

985
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,790
谁娶了她都很幸运
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

986
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,250
但那不会是我
It will not, however, be me.

995
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,750
我明早就告辞
I'm leaving in the morning.

996
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,040
晚安
Good night.

1001
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,290
难以置信
I don't believe that.

1022
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,070
我想跟你在一起
I want to be with you.

1030
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,210
你这是威胁我吗？
Are you threatening me?

1037
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,610
我有证据
I've got proof.

1055
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,210
晚安  休斯太太
Good night, Mrs Hughes.

1056
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,250
晚安  卡森先生
Good night, Mr Carson.

1071
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,500
你觉得她跟慕钱而来的人结婚会幸福吗？
Do you think she would've been happy with a fortune hunter?

1074
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,340
你幸福吗？
Have you been happy?

1075
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,170
我真让你觉得幸福吗？
Really, have I made you happy?

1076
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,630
真的
Yes.

1803
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,910
我这人可比克罗伯勒公爵好多了
I am so much nicer than the Duke of Crowborough.

1084
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,820
这得我说了算
I'll be the judge of that.

1085
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:33,830
别以为我会袖手旁观  罗伯特
don't think I'm going to let it rest, Robert.

1092
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,830
他和公爵大人赶的是同一班火车
He and His Grace are catching the same train.

1096
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,720
再见  公爵
Goodbye, Duke.

1106
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,340
再见  贝茨  祝你好运
Goodbye, Bates, and good luck.

1107
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,090
也祝您好运  老爷
Good luck to you, my lord.

1108
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,980
等等！
Wait!

1117
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,690
他想要改变我们的命运
He wants to change our lives.
