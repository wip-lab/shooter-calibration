Oh, my God.

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,540
这不可能
That's impossible.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,990
我这就送去  
I'll take it up there now.

Don't be stupid.

谢谢  黛西
Thank you, Daisy.

安娜
Anna.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,720
哪怕这辈子只有一次
Just for once in my life

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,540
我真想睡到自然醒
I'd like to sleep until I woke up natural.

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
炉火还旺吗
Is your fire still in?

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,630
是的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,000
还真是不可思议啊
Oh, my, my, will wonders never cease?

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,540
仆人们的早餐摆好了吗
Have you laid the servant's hall breakfast?

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,380
好了  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,940
炉子擦亮了吗
And finished blacking that stove?

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,220
是的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,990
卧室的炉火呢
What about the bedroom fires?

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,850
都生好了  帕特莫太太
All lit, Mrs Patmore.

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,180
好的  带上家什
Right, well, take your things

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,270
去把底楼的火也生了
and get started on the fires on the ground floor.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,550
动作快点
Now, hurry up.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,700
-见着威廉了吗  -没有
- Any sign of William? - No.

46
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,710
-你上哪儿去了  -我没迟到吧
- Where have you been? - I'm not late, am I?

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,380
我说你迟了就是迟了
You're late when I say you're late.

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,250
黛西  你蜷在那儿做什么
Daisy, whatever are you doing there,

49
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,770
黑灯瞎火的
crouching in the dark?

50
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,920
你不在  我也不想用
You weren't here and I didn't like to touch

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,650
脏手去拉窗帘
the curtains with me dirty hands.

52
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,270
说得没错
Well, quite right, too.

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,570
-你怎么不开灯  -我不敢
- Why didn't you put the lights on? - I daren't.

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,240
电又不是什么牛鬼蛇神
Well, it's electricity and not the devil's handiwork.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,410
你早晚都得习惯的
You'll have to get used to it sooner or later.

56
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,990
人家斯凯尔顿庄园连厨房都通上电了
At Skelton Park, they've even got it in the kitchens.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,410
为什么呀
What for?

58
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,460
好的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

59
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,060
早膳已备好  卡森先生
Breakfast is ready, Mr Carson.

60
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,760
威廉  报纸送来了吗
Ah, William, any papers yet?

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,260
-送报员迟到了  -见怪不怪
- They're late. - They certainly are.

62
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,350
把板子准备好  报纸一来就可以熨了
Get the board out so you can do them as soon as they're here.

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,700
书房收拾妥当了吗
Is the library tidy?

64
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,270
收拾好了  休斯太太
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,360
很好  今天要彻底打扫餐厅
Good. I want the dining room given a proper going over today.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,280
他们用完早餐  你们就开始
You can do it when they've finished their breakfast.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,110
天哪  傻丫头
Oh, heavens, girl!

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,700
你是要生火  又不是钻木取火
You're building a fire, not inventing it.

69
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,960
还剩几个了
How many have you done?

70
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,950
主人下楼前最后一个了
This is me last till they come downstairs.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
很好
Very well.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
赶紧回厨房  免得被人瞧见
Now, get back down to the kitchens before anyone sees you.

73
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,460
-他们起来了  -片刻不得消停
- And they're off. - No rest for the wicked.

74
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,630
是玛丽小姐  茶盘备好了吗
Lady Mary. Are the tea trays ready?

75
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,050
都准备好了  帕特莫太太
All ready, Mrs Patmore.

76
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,220
就等水开了
If the water's boiled.

77
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,720
你能帮忙把另两个端上去吗
Could you give us a hand to take the other two up?

78
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,380
我还要服侍夫人呢
I've got her ladyship's to carry.

79
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,800
-我来吧  -后门有人
- I'll help. - Back door.

80
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,970
报纸终于来了  威廉
The papers, at last. William!

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,640
-你迟到了  -是  我知道  但是
- You're late. - Yeah, I know, but...

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,140
-但是什么  -你看了就知道了
- But what? - You'll see.

83
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,490
先熨《泰晤士报》  他早餐时只读这份
Do The Times first, he only reads that at breakfast.

84
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,320
再是夫人的《每日见闻报》
And the Sketch for her ladyship.

85
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,530
其他的等会儿再说  如果需要的话
You can manage the others later, if need be.

86
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,340
-为什么还要熨报纸  -关你什么事
- Why are their papers ironed? - What's it to you?

87
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,840
为了让油墨干透  傻丫头
To dry the ink, silly.

88
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
怎能让老爷的手弄得和你一样脏呢
We wouldn't want his lordship's hands to be as black as yours.

89
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,600
卡森先生  我想你得看看这个
Mr Carson, I think you ought to see this.

90
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,860
-简直不敢相信  -我也是
- I can't make myself believe it. - Me neither.

91
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,440
-老爷更衣完毕  -威廉
- His lordship's dressed. - William!

92
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,360
别聊天了  把这盘鱼蛋烩饭端上去
Will you stop talking and take this kedgeree up.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,940
小心下面还烧着火呢
And mind the burners are still lit.

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,110
好的  帕特莫太太
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

95
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,120
-这是真的吗  -恐怕是的
- Is it really true? - Afraid so.

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,700
世事无常啊
Nothing in life is sure.

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,850
早安  卡森  
Good morning, Carson.

98
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,310
早安  老爷
Good morning, my lord.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,230
他们所言当真  
Is it true what they're saying?

100
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,980
我想是的  老爷
I believe so, my lord.

101
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,070
恐怕船上还有我们认识的人
I'm afraid we'll know some people on it.

102
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,910
幸存者的名单还没公布吧
I don't suppose there are any lists of survivors yet?

103
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,240
据我所知大多数女士被及时救出了
I understand most of the ladies were taken off in time.

104
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,000
你是说头等舱的女宾吧
You mean the ladies in first class?

105
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,120
上帝保佑那些下等舱的可怜人儿
God help the poor devils below decks.

106
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,340
死后能得以超度
On their way to a better life.

107
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,510
真是灭顶之灾啊
What a tragedy.

108
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,990
安娜告诉我的时候
When Anna told me,

109
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,600
我还以为她说梦话呢
I thought she must have dreamt it.

110
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,020
船上有熟人吗
Do we know anyone on board?

111
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,270
你妈妈认识阿斯特一家  至少认识他本人
Your mother knows the Astors, at least she knows him.

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,610
我们上个月还和罗斯小姐共进晚餐
We dined with Lady Rothes last month.

113
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,360
势必还有其他熟人
There are bound to be others.

114
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,200
我以为它永不沉没呢
I thought it was supposed to be unsinkable.

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,780
没有高不可攀的山峰
Every mountain is unclimbable until someone climbs it,

116
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,990
也没有永不翻沉的船
so every ship is unsinkable until it sinks.

117
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
-早安  爸爸  -早  那是什么
- Good morning, Papa. - Good morning. What's that?

118
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,290
刚到的  电报
Just arrived. Telegram.

119
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,810
-夫人醒了吗  -醒了  老爷
- Is her ladyship awake? - Yes, my lord.

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,070
-我这就去把早餐端来  -谢了
- I'm just going to take in her breakfast. - Thank you.

121
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,150
谁啊
Hello.

122
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,860
我能进来吗
May I come in?

123
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,370
简直太不幸了
Isn't this terrible?

124
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,620
一想起露西·罗斯出发有多兴奋
When you think how excited Lucy Rothes was at the prospect.

125
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,290
真是惨到无以言表
It's too awful for any words.

126
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,250
阿斯特逃过一劫了吗
Did J.J. Astor get off?

127
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,420
他的新婚妻子肯定获救了
Of course that new wife of his is bound to have been rescued.

128
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,760
我收到了乔治·莫里发来的电报
I've had a telegram from George Murray.

129
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,090
-他有位合伙人在纽约  -怎么了
- One of his partners is in New York. - Yes?

130
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,800
詹姆斯和帕特里克好像也在船上
It seems James and Patrick were on board.

131
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,020
什么  怎么可能  他们要五月才出发
What? They can't have been. They weren't going over until May.

132
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,880
那就是计划有变
Then they changed their plans.

133
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,310
他们的确在乘客名单上
They're on the passenger list.

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,520
谢谢  奥布瑞恩  先就这样吧
Thank you, O'Brien. That'll be all for the moment.

135
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,070
但他们肯定获救了吧
But surely they were picked up?

136
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,610
-不尽其然  -什么
- Doesn't look like it. - What?

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,950
一个都没救上来吗
Neither of them?

138
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,500
你得告诉玛丽
You must tell Mary.

139
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,840
只有你亲口告诉她才行
She can't hear about it from anyone else.

140
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,640
两个都没被救上来  他是这么说的
Neither of them were picked up, that's what he said.

141
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,420
卡劳利先生和帕特里克少爷吗
Mr Crawley and Mr Patrick?

142
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,850
他是这么说的
That's what he said.

143
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,520
夫人惊得面色煞白
Her ladyship was the colour of this cloth.

144
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,150
如果真是这样  那就太可惜了
Well, it's a terrible shame if it's true.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
怎一个可惜了得  这下麻烦大了
It's worse than a shame, it's a complication.

146
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,030
-此话怎讲  -你说呢
- What do you mean? - What do you think?

147
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,980
卡劳利先生是老爷的堂兄
Mr Crawley was his lordship's cousin

148
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
也是爵位继承人
and heir to the title.

149
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,540
我以为玛丽小姐才是继承人
I thought Lady Mary was the heir.

150
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,800
她是个女孩  傻丫头
She's a girl, stupid.

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,410
女孩不能做继承人
Girls can't inherit.

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,190
但现在卡劳利先生已故
But now Mr Crawley's dead

153
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,000
而帕特里克少爷又是他的独子
and Mr Patrick was his only son.

154
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,670
-这下如何是好  -真是太可怕了
- So, what happens next? - It's a dreadful thing.

155
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,340
您好
Hello.

156
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,180
我一直等在后门  却一直没人应门
I've been waiting at the back door. I knocked, but no one came.

157
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,010
那你就推门而入了
So you pushed in?

158
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,770
我叫约翰·贝茨  是新来的男仆
I'm John Bates, the new valet.

159
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,190
-新来的男仆  -没错
- The new valet? - That's right.

160
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,150
-你来得真早  -搭清晨的车过来的
- You're early. - Came on the milk train.

161
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,490
想用白天的时间熟悉环境  今晚上任
Thought I'd use the day to get to know the place, start tonight.

162
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,700
我是安娜  女仆领班
I'm Anna, the head housemaid.

163
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,160
您好
How do you do?

164
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,250
我是奥布瑞恩小姐  夫人的贴身侍女
And I'm Miss O'Brien, her ladyship's maid.

165
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,540
随我们来
You better come along with us.

166
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,070
但你要怎么应付得过来
But how can you manage?

167
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,640
不必担心  我自能应对
Don't worry about that, I can manage.

168
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,060
-我们可都有活在身  -我能行
- Because we've all got our own work to do. - I can manage.

169
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,190
好了  休斯太太
All right, Mrs Hughes,

170
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,690
我来负责这里  谢谢
I'll take over. Thank you.

171
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,110
早上好  贝茨先生  欢迎
Good morning, Mr Bates. Welcome.

172
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,070
-愿你旅途一切顺利  -顺利  谢谢
- I hope your journey was satisfactory. - It was fine. Thank you.

173
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,280
我是唐顿庄园的管家  我叫卡森
I am the butler of Downton. My name is Carson.

174
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,780
您好  卡森先生
How do you do, Mr Carson?

175
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,990
这位是托马斯  第一男仆
This is Thomas, first footman.

176
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,730
自沃特森先生走后  老爷的起居
He's been looking after his lordship

177
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,290
一直由他负责
since Mr Watson left.

178
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,290
这下终于能回归正轨了  对吧  托马斯
It'll be a relief to get back to normal, won't it, Thomas?

179
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,790
贝茨先生的房间都安排妥当了吧
I assume that everything is ready for Mr Bates' arrival?

180
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,840
就安排在原来沃特森先生的住处
I've put him in Mr Watson's old room.

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,340
虽然他走的时候屋里一片狼藉
Though he left it in quite a state, I can tell you.

182
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,380
可那么多台阶怎么办
But what about all them stairs?

183
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,100
-我都说了  我能行  -当然
- I keep telling you, I can manage. - Of course you can.

184
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,580
托马斯  领贝茨先生入住
Thomas, take Mr Bates to his room,

185
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,770
带他去看看工作的地方
show him where he'll be working.

186
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,070
多谢各位
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,620
我可不觉得这长久得了
Well, I can't see that lasting long.

188
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,610
行了  奥布瑞恩小姐
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

189
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,770
好极了
Oh, yes.

190
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,780
我在这里会住得很舒服
I should be comfortable here.

191
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,040
难道是说我必须戴重孝吗
Does this mean I'll have to go into full mourning?

192
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,750
我的堂兄和侄子几乎已确定遇难
My first cousin and his son are almost certainly dead.

193
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,490
我们全家都得服丧  
We'll all be in mourning.

194
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,760
不  我是说那件事
No, I mean with the other thing.

195
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,260
毕竟没有正式订婚
After all, it wasn't official.

196
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,200
若你不想以未婚妻的身份
If you're saying you do not wish to

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,770
为帕特里克戴孝  那就随你吧
mourn Patrick as a fiance, that is up to you.

198
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,100
反正只有家里人知道
Well, no one knew about it outside the family.

199
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,100
我说了  你自己决定
I repeat, it is up to you.

200
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,110
这样我就放心了
Well, that's a relief.

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,870
阁楼上有几个内衬雪松木的衣柜
There's some cedar-lined cupboards in the attic

202
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
摆放不常穿着的服装
for things that aren't often worn,

203
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,080
以及旅行装束等
travelling clothes and such.

204
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,090
沃特森先生把换季衣物都收在那里
Mr Watson used them to rotate the summer and winter stuff.

205
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,050
迟些带你去看
I'll show you later.

206
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,900
饰纽和链扣如何挑选  
What about studs and links?

207
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,140
由我定还是他定
Do I choose them or does he?

208
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,010
没有特别交代就呈给他挑选
Lay them out unless he asks for something in particular.

209
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,860
这些是舞会用的
These for a ball,

210
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,840
家常便餐时用这些  
these for an ordinary dinner,

211
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,230
这些只在伦敦用
these only in London.

212
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,650
-我会记清楚的  -是的  你必须记住
- I'll get the hang of it.  - Yeah, you'll have to.

213
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,570
鼻烟壶  他收集的
Snuff boxes, he collects them.

214
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,110
精美
Beautiful.

215
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
-你我这份工作真是滑稽  -怎么说
- Funny our job, isn't it?  - What do you mean?

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,460
奇珍异宝触手可及
The way we live with all this pirate's hoard within our reach.

217
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,080
可没有一件属于我们  不是吗
But none of it's ours, is it?

218
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,500
是的  不属于我们
No, none of it's ours.

219
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,390
我竟被个跛脚的强盗抢了职位
I can't believe I've been passed over for Long John Silver.

220
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,390
出自《金银岛》

221
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,650
上次有机会  这话你就该直接挑明
You should have spoken up when you had the chance.

222
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,440
下次别再犯同样的错
Don't make the same mistake next time.

223
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,280
谁知还会不会有下次
Who says there'll be a next time?

224
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,610
莫非今天休假他们忘了通知我
Is this a public holiday no one's told me of ?

225
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,830
她显然是不愿意服丧
She was certainly reluctant to go into mourning.

226
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,410
她会的  我们都要服丧
Well, she'll have to. We all will.

227
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,330
奥布瑞恩在为我整理黑色丧服
O'Brien's sorting out my black now.

228
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,510
我已经让安娜去看看
And I've told Anna to see

229
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,460
女儿们有什么合适的衣服
what the girls have that still fits.

230
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,220
这桩意外改变了一切
Of course, this alters everything.

231
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,350
这一点不容你否认
You won't try to deny it.

232
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,470
毫无疑问你必须争取改变限定继承权
You must challenge the entail now, surely.

233
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,230
就不能等确定他们遇难了
Can't we at least wait until we know they're dead

234
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,060
再讨论这件事
before we discuss it?

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,650
别说得好像我铁石心肠一样  我也很伤心
Don't talk as if I'm not brokenhearted, because I am.

236
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,190
可我没法理解为何这份产业只能
Of course, I've never understood why this estate must go

237
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,900
由继承你爵位的人接管
to whomever inherits your title.

238
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,370
亲爱的  法律并非由我制定  什么事
My dear, I don't make the law. What is it?

239
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,160
老夫人到了  在客厅里
The Dowager Countess is in the drawing room.

240
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,370
-我马上来  -她要见夫人
- I'll come now.  - She asked for Lady Grantham.

241
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
不知这次我又做错了什么
I wonder what I've done wrong this time.

242
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,210
另外新男仆已到任  老爷
Oh. And the new valet has arrived, my lord.

243
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,500
是吗  谢谢  卡森
Has he? Thank you, Carson.

244
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,720
还有什么事
What is it?

245
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,640
我不太确定他能否胜任这份工作
I'm not entirely sure that he'll prove equal to the task.

246
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,010
但这由老爷您决定
But your lordship will be the judge of that.

247
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,730
我先过去了
Better go.

248
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,270
告诉她詹姆斯和帕特里克的噩耗  
Tell her about James and Patrick.

249
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,820
她应该还不知道
She won't have heard.

250
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,030
我当然已经得知  否则何必匆匆赶来
Of course I've heard. Why else would I be here?

251
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,410
罗伯特不想让您
Robert didn't want you to

252
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,700
因报纸上的消息而哀伤过度
read about it in the newspaper and be upset.

253
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,540
他多虑了
He flatters me.

254
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,790
我没那么多愁善感
I'm tougher than I look.

255
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,460
当然了  我为可怜的帕特里克感到难过
I'm very sorry about poor Patrick, of course.

256
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,630
-他是个好孩子  -我们都很喜欢这孩子
- He was a nice boy.  - We were all so fond of him.

257
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,050
可我一直不喜欢詹姆斯
But I never cared for James.

258
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,800
他像极了他母亲
He was too like his mother

259
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,890
一刻也不让人安生
and a nastier woman never drew breath.

260
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,600
-您留下用午餐吗  -谢谢
- Will you stay for some luncheon?  - Thank you.

261
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
-我去通知卡森  -我已经跟他说了
- I'll let Carson know.  - I've already told him.

262
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,560
能坐下说话了吗
Shall we sit down?

263
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,970
你知道新继承人吗  
Do you know the new heir?

264
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,440
只听说是有一位
Only that there is one.

265
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,160
他是罗伯特的远房堂侄
He's Robert's third cousin, once removed.

266
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,740
我记得我从没见过他
I have never to my knowledge set eyes on him.

267
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,760
可要不是已故的老伯爵
Of course, if your late husband hadn't

268
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,500
逼着我签字  侵吞我的财产
forced me to sign that absurd act of legal theft...

269
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,420
亲爱的  我来此并非为了争执
My dear, I didn't come here to fight.

270
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,590
格兰瑟姆老伯爵只想保护这份家业
Lord Grantham wanted to protect the estate.

271
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,420
他从未料想到你没生下子嗣
It never occurred to him that you wouldn't have a son.

272
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,340
-我是没有  -是啊  你没有
- Well, I didn't.  - No, you did not.

273
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,470
但如果帕特里克能够迎娶玛丽
But when Patrick had married Mary

274
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,160
你的外孙将来会成为一家之主
and your grandson been hailed as master,

275
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,270
家族也不失体面
honour would have been satisfied.

276
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,270
可不幸的是  现在
Unfortunately, now...

277
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,020
现在一个陌生人将有权处置我的财产
Now, a complete unknown has the right to pocket my money

278
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,690
还有这份家业
along with the rest of the swag.

279
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,740
问题是保住你的嫁妆  庄园就会破产
The problem is, saving your dowry would break up the estate.

280
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
那会毁掉罗伯特这辈子苦心经营的一切
It would be the ruin of everything Robert's given his life to.

281
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,000
-他也明白这点吗  -总会明白的
- And he knows this?  - Well, if he doesn't, he will.

282
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,630
那就是两难境地  
Then there's no answer.

283
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,920
不  还有一条出路  相当简单
Yes, there is, and it's a simple one.

284
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,930
彻底打破对继承权的限制
The entail must be smashed in its entirety

285
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,510
让玛丽成为继承人
and Mary recognised as heiress of all.

286
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,930
-可我们没法保住爵位  -是啊
- There's nothing we can do about the title.  - No.

287
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,020
她不能继承爵位  但至少能保住你的财产
She can't have the title, but she can have your money.

288
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,570
还有庄园
And the estate.

289
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,440
我经营唐顿庄园30年
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

290
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,870
不能眼看着它
to see it go lock, stock

291
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,410
落入一个不知哪里冒出来的陌生人手中
and barrel to a stranger from God knows where.

292
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,700
这么说我们将成为朋友
Are we to be friends, then?

293
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,980
不如说是同盟  亲爱的  
We are allies, my dear,

294
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,130
同盟办事效率更高
which can be a good deal more effective.

295
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,770
唐顿是一所了不起的庄园  贝茨先生
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates.

296
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,640
卡劳利同样也是了不起的家族
And the Crawleys are a great family.

297
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,760
我们日常起居有规有矩
We live by certain standards

298
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,770
这些规矩起初令人望而生畏
and those standards can at first seem daunting.

299
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,020
应该的
Of course.

300
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,520
如果你面见大人时感到拘谨不安
If you find yourself tongue-tied in the presence of his lordship,

301
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,030
那么他的礼仪和风范
I can only assure you that his manners and grace

302
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,210
会帮助你
will soon help you to

303
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,660
很快地进入角色
perform your duties to the best of your ability.

304
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,780
我明白
I know.

305
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,660
贝茨  我的老朋友
Bates, my dear fellow.

306
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,990
非常抱歉  
I do apologise,

307
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,540
我应该想到你们正在用午餐
I should have realised you'd all be at luncheon.

308
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,820
没关系  老爷 
Not at all, my lord.

309
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,170
请坐下吧  大家请坐
Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

310
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,790
我只想来跟老战友打个招呼
I just want to say a quick hello to my old comrade in arms.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
贝茨  我的兄弟  欢迎来到唐顿
Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

312
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,840
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

313
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,350
很抱歉打扰各位  请原谅
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all. Please forgive me.

314
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,560
你们没问起
You never asked.

315
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,740
托马斯  把那盘端上去
Thomas, take that up.

316
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,700
别管他  黛西  他是个大小伙子
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

317
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,910
一盘肉饼总能端得动
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

318
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,120
去把苹果馅饼放进烤箱下层
Now, put that apple tart in the lower oven.

319
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,690
快把那个端走
Oh, and take that away.

320
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,170
林奇先生不该把它摆在这里
Mr Lynch shouldn't have left it there.

321
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,050
-这是什么  -草酸氢钾
- What is it?  - Salt of Sorrel.

322
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,090
我要来擦铜壶用的
I asked him for some to clean the brass pots.

323
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,300
找个地方小心放着  那东西可有毒
So, put it somewhere careful. It's poison.

324
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,610
食物准备得也太多了吧
Seems like a lot of food

325
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,930
他们可是正在服丧
when you think they're all in mourning.

326
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,730
哀伤总是让人又饿又累
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired than grief.

327
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,480
我姐姐走的时候  愿她安息
When my sister died, God rest her soul,

328
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,780
我一口气吃了四盘三明治
I ate my way through four platefuls of sandwiches at one sitting

329
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,900
然后睡了整整12个小时
and slept round the clock.

330
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,280
那之后你感觉好些吗
Did it make you feel better?

331
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,740
没什么用  可总能打发时间
Not much, but it passed the time.

332
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,180
我的天哪
Oh, my Lord!

333
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,540
这些碎鸡蛋本来要撒在哪里来着
What was this chopped egg supposed to be sprinkled on?

334
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,310
是不是那盘鸡肉  
Was it the chicken?

335
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,160
没错  赶紧送楼上去
It was. Take it upstairs now.

336
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,080
-可我不能进餐厅  -我当然知道
- I can't go in the dining room.  - I should think not.

337
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,670
让托马斯或者威廉去  告诉他们怎么弄
Find Thomas or William and tell them what to do.

338
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,650
倒是赶紧去啊  姑娘
And for heaven's sake get a move on, girl,

339
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,720
一会儿他们就从教堂回来了
before they get back from church.

340
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,740
我们在伦敦和这里
Well, we've given them a memorial in London

341
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,430
分别开了追思会
and a memorial here.

342
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,640
比葬礼好  没这么伤感
I prefer memorials to funerals, they're less dispiriting.

343
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,810
没有遗体我们没办法举行葬礼
We could hardly have held a funeral without the bodies.

344
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,440
我看他们会建一座纪念碑
I gather they're putting up a stone

345
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,110
纪念那些长眠海底的人
to mark those whose bodies were never found.

346
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,700
事实上我听说加拿大人
In fact, I hear the Canadians

347
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,240
建了泰坦尼克号公墓
are making quite a thing at the Titanic cemetery.

348
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,280
想不到他们能找回这么多遗骸
I'm surprised at the number they found.

349
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,740
本以为更多遇难者将安眠大海深处
You'd think the sea would've taken more of them.

350
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,610
莫里  关于那位
So, Murray, what have you to tell me

351
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,420
幸运的卡劳利家成员有什么消息
about the lucky Mr Crawley?

352
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,170
希望不算太糟
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

353
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,230
我只做了一点调查
I've only made a few inquiries,

354
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,960
不过没有什么需要您担心的
but no, there's not much to alarm you.

355
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,990
马修·卡劳利是一名律师
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor

356
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,050
在曼彻斯特工作
based in Manchester.

357
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,590
曼彻斯特
Manchester?

358
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,720
他的专长是公司法
His special field is company law.

359
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,180
母亲健在  和他住在一起
His mother is alive and he lives with her.

360
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,190
父亲已过世  生前是医生
His father obviously is not. He was a doctor.

361
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,560
我知道了
I know.

362
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,130
这真够古怪的
It does seem odd

363
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,320
我的远房堂兄竟做了医生
that my third cousin should be a doctor.

364
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,820
医生也差不到哪里去
There are worse professions.

365
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,990
的确如此
Indeed.

366
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,070
帮个忙  
Do me a favour.

367
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,620
这个应该撒在鸡肉上
This is supposed to be sprinkled on the chicken.

368
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,090
不是还有菜要端吗
But isn't there more to go up?

369
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,580
求你了  用不了几分钟
Oh, please, it won't take a moment.

370
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,170
-好吧  交给我  -好的
- Go on then, give it here.  - Okay.

371
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,470
我们该谈谈限定继承权的事情
We ought to talk about the business of the entail.

372
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,300
如你所知  你百年之后
As you know, on your death,

373
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,010
承袭爵位者将继承这一切
the heir to the title inherits everything,

374
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,810
除了留给孤儿寡母的那点遗产
except for the sums set aside for your daughters and your widow.

375
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,020
是的
Yes.

376
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,190
根据夫人的婚姻协议
Owing to the terms of her settlement,

377
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,690
这也包括她的那部分财产
this will include the bulk of your wife's fortune.

378
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,400
沉船之后这成了我们
It has been our sole topic of conversation

379
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,610
唯一的话题
since the day the ship went down.

380
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,490
尽管对格兰瑟姆夫人非常不公
Of course it must seem horribly unjust to Lady Grantham,

381
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,240
可法律规定如此
but that is how the law stands.

382
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,120
真没有办法帮她留份财产吗
Is there really no way to detach her money from the estate?

383
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,570
连我都觉得这很荒谬
Even to me, it seems absurd.

384
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,310
令尊坚持要这么做
Your father tied the knots pretty tight.

385
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,080
没有余地变通
I'd say it's unbreakable.

386
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,450
我懂了
I see.

387
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,010
伊迪丝  何必这么入戏呢
Really, Edith, do you have to put on such an exhibition?

388
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,620
她是真伤心
She's not.

389
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,760
要和他订婚的不是你  是我
I was supposed to be engaged to him, for heaven's sake, not you.

390
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,210
我都没这么失态
And I can control myself.

391
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,670
那你就该羞愧
Then you should be ashamed.

392
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,180
这碗蛋怎么还没送上去
Oh, and don't tell me you've not sent up the egg yet.

393
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,610
噢上帝  帮帮我  求你了帮帮我
Oh, God, help me! Please, God, help me!

394
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,110
怎么回事
Well, what on earth's the matter?

395
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,230
赶快去楼上餐厅找威廉
Just run upstairs to the dining room and find William.

396
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,990
-求你了  -我现在没空
- I beg you.  - I can't do that now.

397
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,660
求你帮帮忙
You've got to.

398
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,580
-不然我死定了  -什么
- I'll be hanged if you don't.  - What?

399
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,240
黛西  是你吗
Daisy, is that you?

400
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,500
是洒在鸡肉沙拉上
Is it the chicken in a sauce

401
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,410
还是橘片白切鸡上
or the plain chicken with sliced oranges?

402
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,580
感谢万能慈悲的主  谢谢你
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful Lord! Thank you.

403
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,670
洒在鸡丝沙拉上
It's the chicken in the sauce.

404
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,170
我以后要多做善事  我发誓
I'll never do anything sinful again, I swear it. Not till I die.

405
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,680
莫里先生  幸会  快请进
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you. Do come in.

406
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,580
多谢盛情  格兰瑟姆夫人
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,

407
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,730
但我要赶回伦敦
but I must get back to London.

408
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,580
不留下吃午饭了吗
But you'll stay for luncheon?

409
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,230
没这个福气了  我在火车上吃
Thank you, but no, I'll eat on the train.

410
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,220
可否劳驾您
In fact, if you'd be so good

411
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,690
派车送我过去
as to ask for the motor be brought round?

412
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,950
下午不再谈谈了吗
But didn't you want the afternoon to talk things through?

413
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,760
已经谈得差不多了
I think we've said everything we have to say,

414
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,200
您说对吗  阁下
haven't we, my lord?

415
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,040
目前是差不多了
For the time being, yes.

416
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,870
谢谢你  莫里
Thank you, Murray.

417
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,700
你的建议我会考虑
You've given me a good deal to think about.

418
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,300
玛丽  请大家进餐厅
Mary, try to get everyone into the dining room.

419
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,790
伊迪丝  请敏特里老爷坐下
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne sits down.

420
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,630
-都走了吗  -感谢上帝  都走了
- They've all gone?  - They have, thank the Lord.

421
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,520
-律师呢  -他头一个走
- Oh, what about the lawyer?  - Oh, he was the first away.

422
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,610
连午饭都没吃
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

423
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,190
怎么不早说呢
I wish they'd make their minds up.

424
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,490
格温连蓝屋的床单都铺了
Gwen's put clean sheets on the Blue Room bed.

425
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,820
现在又得收起来
Now she'll just have to strip it again.

426
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,180
留给以后的客人不行吗
Can't you leave it for the next guest?

427
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,150
除非你不告状
Well, only if you don't tell.

428
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,660
尘埃落定了吗
So, has it all been settled?

429
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,590
哪儿都没落定呢
No. I don't know if anything's been settled.

430
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,340
曼城确实有位继承人
There's a fellow in Manchester with claims to the title,

431
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,880
但离确定还早着呢
I gather, but it's all a long way from settled.

432
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,580
你可别往心里去
You mustn't take it personally.

433
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,760
不  我确实很担心  休斯太太
No, I do take it personally, Mrs. Hughes.

434
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,690
我不忍心眼睁睁
I can't stand by and watch our family

435
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,930
看着亲人无端失去财产
threatened with a loss of all they hold dear.

436
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,950
他们不算我们亲人吧
They are not our family.

437
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,680
他们是我唯一的亲人
Well, they're all the family I've got.

438
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,520
抱歉  我失态了
I beg your pardon.

439
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,030
你可曾想过另一种生活吗
Do you ever wish you'd gone another way?

440
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,450
开店做工  
Worked in a shop or a factory?

441
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,460
娶妻生子吗
Had a wife and children?

442
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,790
你后悔吗
Do you?

443
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,130
不知道  可能有点
I don't know. Maybe.

444
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,090
有时候挺后悔
Sometimes.

445
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,350
威廉在书房摆好茶了
William's laid tea in the library,

446
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,190
但夫人还没下楼
but Her Ladyship hasn't come down.

447
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,070
她累了  端上去送进房吧
Oh, she'll be tired. Take a tray up to her bedroom.

448
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,940
-托马斯回来了吗  -还没有  卡森先生
- Is Thomas back? - Not yet, Mr. Carson.

449
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,410
他请了假去村里逛逛
He asked if he could run down the village,

450
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,030
我何必拦着
I didn't see why not.

451
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,980
太不公平了
It's iniquitous.

452
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,160
您平白没了财产
They can't expect you to sit by silent

453
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,110
还得故作镇定
as your fortune is stolen away.

454
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,240
又能怎样
Can't they?

455
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,360
老爷不会不管的
His Lordship would never let it happen.

456
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,110
贝茨干得怎么样
How's Bates working out?

457
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,200
我不敢评论
Well, I don't like to say.

458
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,770
他腿脚不方便
Only it seems unkind to criticise a man

459
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,450
我不该多嘴的
for an affliction, my lady.

460
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,330
哪怕他不能胜任
Even if it means he can't do his job.

461
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,380
做得还习惯吗
How are you settling in?

462
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,890
若老爷没有异议  我觉得还不错
Very well, I think. Unless your Lordship feels differently.

463
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,440
没什么不顺心的吗
No complaints?

464
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,680
即使有  也该先跟卡森先生说
If I had any, I should take them to Mr. Carson,

465
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,720
而不是找老爷您
my Lord, not you.

466
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,310
那倒是
You're probably right.

467
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,210
这上楼下楼的
And the house hasn't worn you out

468
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,160
你吃得消吗
with the endless stairs and everything?

469
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,030
我喜欢这房子  老爷  喜欢在这干活
I like the house, my Lord. I like it as a place to work.

470
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,070
-那是怎么回事  -旧伤罢了
- What happened?  - Oh, it's only the old wound.

471
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,880
退伍后我遇上点麻烦
After I left the army, I had a spot of bother

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,660
后来解决了
and just when I got through that

473
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,080
一年前这膝盖开始不听使唤
about a year ago my knee started playing up.

474
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,360
里面有块弹片移了位
A bit of shrapnel got left in or something and it moved,

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,850
不过不碍事
but it's fine.

476
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,220
没问题
It's not a problem.

477
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,720
要有问题了  就跟我说
And you'd let me know if you felt it was all too much for you?

478
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,050
是  不会有问题的
I would. But it won't be.

479
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,390
托马斯
Thomas.

480
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,230
-你去哪了  -村子里
- And where have you been?  - The village.

481
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,710
发电报去了  若非打听不可
To send a telegram, if you must know.

482
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,730
随便打听嘛
Pardon me for living.

483
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,070
莫里没呆多久
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,750
-夫人知道结果吗  -不知道
- Does Her Ladyship know how they left it?  - No.

485
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,340
他们从教堂回来  路上就谈完了
They talked it all through on the way back from the church.

486
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,720
我要还跟老爷  早探出消息了
If I was still his valet, I'd get it out of him.

487
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,960
-贝茨的嘴严着呢  -没错
- Bates won't say a word.  - He will not.

488
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,720
十镑  我赌他是主子的眼线
I bet you a tenner he's a spy in the other direction.

489
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,760
我想跟着老爷
I wanted that job.

490
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,730
我可是他的得力助手
We were all right together, His Lordship and me.

491
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,730
那等贝茨走了
Then be sure to get your foot in the door

492
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,860
你就想办法跟紧老爷
when Bates is gone.

493
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,570
光说他暗地里嚼舌根可赶不走他
You can't get rid of him just because he talks behind our backs.

494
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,110
东方不亮西方亮  办法多的是
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

495
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,410
-夫人没听懂吧  -说得很明白了
- Perhaps she misunderstood.  - No, it was quite plain.

496
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,290
奥布瑞恩明说了  贝茨伺候不好老爷
O'Brien told her Bates can't do the job properly.

497
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,920
怎么偏请了他呢
Why was he taken on?

498
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,210
布尔战争时  他给老爷当过勤务兵
He was Lord Grantham's batman when he was fighting the Boers.

499
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,470
我知道  那也犯不着
I know that, but even so.

500
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,470
-我觉得定有原因  -什么原因
- I think it's romantic.  - I don't.

501
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,640
一个瘸子怎么当贴身侍从呢
How can a valet do his work if he's lame?

502
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,670
倒不是特别瘸
He's not very lame.

503
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,770
好了  小姐还有吩咐吗
There. Anything else before I go down?

504
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,140
没了  下去吧
No, that's it. Thank you.

505
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,690
一身黑真难看
Oh, I hate black.

506
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,320
又不用穿很久
It's not for long.

507
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,330
妈妈说下个月就改半丧
Mama says we can go into half-mourning next month.

508
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,950
到九月就不用穿黑了
And back to colours by September.

509
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,700
-死了堂兄而已  何必呢  -不是未婚夫吗
- Still seems a lot for a cousin.  - But not a fiance?

510
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,370
-不算未婚夫吧  -真的吗
- He wasn't really a fiance.  - No?

511
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,340
都要结婚了  还不是未婚夫
I thought that was what you call a man you're going to marry.

512
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,510
实在没得选了我才会嫁给他
I was only going to marry him if nothing better turned up.

513
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,430
-玛丽  别这么说  -怕什么
- Mary, what a horrid thing to say.  - Don't worry.

514
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,880
想嫁他的是伊迪丝  对吧
Edith would have taken him, wouldn't you?

515
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,550
是  我想嫁他
Yes, I'd have taken him.

516
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,720
要不是你  我早嫁给他了
If you'd given me the chance, I'd have taken him like a shot.

517
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,530
这实在行不通  卡森先生
I just think you should know it's not working, Mr. Carson.

518
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,030
贝茨先生很懒散吗
Do you mean Mr. Bates is lazy?

519
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,230
不是懒散  是干不了重活
Not lazy, exactly. But he just can't carry.

520
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,000
他连老爷的箱子都差点提不动
He can hardly manage His Lordship's cases.

521
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,030
去伦敦参加追思会的那次   
You saw how it was when they went up

522
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,870
您也看见了
to London for the memorial.

523
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,500
他也没法帮客人拿行李
He can't help with the guests' luggage neither.

524
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,670
更别说伺候用餐了
And as for waiting at table, we can forget that.

525
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,360
你想让我怎么样呢
And what do you want me to do?

526
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,710
我本不该多嘴
Well, it's not for me to say.

527
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,220
但让威廉担那么多活合适吗
But is it fair on William to have all the extra work?

528
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,890
我想您不愿看到
I don't believe you'd like to think

529
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,680
家务水准低于以往吧
the house was falling below the way things ought to be.

530
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,050
-当然不愿意  -我就这意思
- I would not.  - That's all I'm saying.

531
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,230
我下楼去  来吗
I'm going down. Coming?

532
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,730
一会来  你先去吧
In a moment. You go.

533
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,000
帕特里克出事  我知道你是伤心的
I know you're sad about Patrick.

534
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,450
不管你怎么逞强
Whatever you say, I know it.

535
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,120
你真贴心
You're a darling.

536
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,130
可我并没那么伤心
But you see, I'm not as sad as I should be.

537
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,630
这才让我难过
And that's what makes me sad.

538
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,130
谢谢
Thank you.

539
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,440
-我来捡吧  -不用  谢谢老爷
- I'll do that.  - No. No, thank you, My Lord.

540
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,640
-我能行  -明白
- I can do it.  - I'm sure.

541
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,940
但愿吧  老爷  希望您能相信我
I hope so, My Lord. I hope you're sure.

542
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,480
贝茨  说白了吧
Bates, we have to be sensible.

543
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,000
你要是负担太重
I won't be doing you a favour in the long run

544
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,820
我这就是在帮倒忙
if it's too much for you.

545
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,790
有交情没错  可正事不能耽误
No matter what we've been through, it's got to work.

546
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,320
当然了长官  不  老爷
Of course it has, sir. I mean, My Lord.

547
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,500
怀念打仗的日子吧  贝茨
Do you miss the army, Bates?

548
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,330
怀念是有的  可总得向前看
I miss a lot of things, but you have to keep moving, don't you?

549
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,660
没错  说得好
You do, indeed.

550
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,130
老爷  我会证明我绝不辜负您
I'll show you, My Lord, I promise. I won't let you down.

551
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,960
大风大浪都一起过来了  对吧
We've managed so far, haven't we?

552
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,670
对  当然
Yes, we have. Of course we have.

553
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,310
-很漂亮  -谢谢  亲爱的
- You look very nice.  - Thank you, darling.

554
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,310
莫里挑明说了吗  
Did Murray make matters clearer?

555
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,560
是  恐怕没戏
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

556
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,300
对了  奥布瑞恩跟我说
By the way, O'Brien says

557
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,670
贝茨干家务不太利索
Bates is causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

558
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,790
您说说他吧
You may have to do something about it.

559
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,290
她就会找麻烦
She's always making trouble.

560
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,830
她忍到现在才说  难道也是搬弄是非
Is that fair when she hasn't mentioned it before now?

561
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,170
你怎么老听她的瞎话
I don't know why you listen to her.

562
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,120
即便是你  身边跟着个瘸腿男仆
It is quite eccentric, even for you,

563
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,310
也够让人侧目的了
to have a crippled valet.

564
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,480
拜托  别用瘸这个字眼
Please, don't use that word.

565
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,770
他求职时难道没提不能走路吗
Did he tell you he couldn't walk when he made his application?

566
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,060
别夸大其辞
Don't exaggerate.

567
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,820
你不觉得隐瞒实情是很不诚实的吗
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest not to mention it?

568
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,400
-我知道他曾受过伤  -你可从未提过
- I knew he'd been wounded. - You never said.

569
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,200
你知道我不愿对此多谈
You know I don't care to talk about all that.

570
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,960
我可以理解你的心情
Of course I understand what it must

571
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,370
毕竟你们曾彼此并肩作战出生入死
be like to have fought alongside someone in a war.

572
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,290
-是么  你真的了解吗  -当然了
- Oh, you understand that, do you? - Certainly I do.

573
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,040
你们毕竟也算是生死之交
You must form the most tremendous bonds.

574
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,580
-即使他是个仆人  -真的吗
- Even with a servant. - Really?

575
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,710
即使他是个仆人
Even with a servant?

576
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,010
罗伯特  别吹毛求疵
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

577
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,050
我完全理解你想帮助他的初衷
I'm simply saying I fully see why you want to help him.

578
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
但是
But?

579
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,100
但也不能勉强他做根本无法胜任的工作
But is this the right way, to employ him for a job he can't do?

580
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,640
也难怪别人说长道短的
Is it any wonder if the others' noses are put out?

581
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,390
我只是想给他个机会
I just want to give him a chance.

582
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,900
妈妈  抱歉  我不知您来此
Mama, I'm sorry, no one told me you were here.

583
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,450
真要命  这么刺眼的光
Oh, dear, such a glare.

584
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,350
搞得我觉得自己跟登台唱大戏似的
I feel as if I were on stage at the Gaiety.

585
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,000
我们倒是都习惯了
We're used to it.

586
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,790
我非常希望给您的府邸也安上一套
I do wish you'd let me install it in the Dower House.

587
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,500
它非常方便
It's very convenient.

588
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,340
我家电工可以连您的宅子一并打理
The man who manages the generator could look after yours as well.

589
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,330
不要  我才不要在宅子里安电灯呢
No. I couldn't have electricity in the house.

590
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,880
我肯定整宿都合不上眼
I wouldn't sleep a wink.

591
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,760
搞得到处都是蒸汽什么的
All those vapours seeping about.

592
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,550
柯拉也不愿意在卧室里安灯
Even Cora won't have it in the bedroom.

593
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,560
她倒是曾想在厨房里安电灯  
She did wonder about the kitchens,

594
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,850
真不知道那有什么用
but I couldn't see the point.

595
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,660
趁着现在没有旁人打扰
Well, before anyone joins us,

596
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,100
我想跟你说几句话
I'm glad of this chance for a little talk.

597
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,910
我听说今天莫里来了  
I gather Murray was here today?

598
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,270
消息传得真快  
News travels fast.

599
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,090
没错  我是见了 但他态度并不乐观  
Yes. I saw him and he's not optimistic

600
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,740
恐怕我们只能听天由命
that there's anything we can do.

601
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,690
我才不信这一套呢  
Well, I refuse to believe it.

602
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,080
无论如何  这已既成事实
Be that as it may, it's a fact.

603
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,620
但柯拉财产可就保不住了
But to lose Cora's fortune to...

604
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,040
说真的  妈妈  你我心知肚明
Really, Mama, you know as well as I do

605
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,210
柯拉的财产早就不归她支配了
that Cora's fortune is not Cora's fortune any more.

606
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,920
多亏了爸爸  那份财产早就归为家产了
Thanks to Papa, it is now part of the estate.

607
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,630
而现在全都限定留给我的继承人
And the estate is entailed to my heir,

608
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,630
就这样  没什么可说的了
that is it. That is all of it.

609
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,880
罗伯特  亲爱的  我不想说难听话
Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound harsh...

610
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,810
难不难听的  您反正是要说的
You may not mean to, but I bet you will.

611
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,510
二十四年前你违背我愿
Twenty-four years ago you married Cora,

612
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,690
为了钱财  娶了柯拉  
against my wishes, for her money.

613
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,770
现在钱要拱手送人
Give it away now, what was the point

614
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,480
那之前费劲娶她有什么意义呢
of your peculiar marriage in the first place?

615
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,190
假如我说她让我无比幸福
If I were to tell you she'd made me very happy,

616
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,610
您会相信吗
would that stretch belief?

617
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,120
你娶她可不是为了这个
It's not why you chose her,

618
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,690
再说了当时有那么多的姑娘
above all those other girls

619
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,540
随意选一位都合我意
who could've filled my shoes so easily.

620
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,560
实话跟您讲吧  当我回想起
If you must know, when I think of

621
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,500
当年追求柯拉的动机时  我感到很羞愧
my motives for pursuing Cora, I'm ashamed.

622
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,670
您就别再旧事重提刺激我了
There's no need to remind me of them.

623
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,800
你就一点都不在乎唐顿吗
Don't you care about Downton?

624
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,510
您觉得呢
What do you think?

625
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,850
我这一生的精力都倾注在唐顿庄园上
I've given my life to Downton.

626
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,310
我生于斯  也希望死于斯
I was born here and I hope to die here.

627
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,310
我毕生的事业就是振兴这份家产
I claim no career beyond the nurture of this house and the estate.

628
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,980
这大半辈子我含辛茹苦  呕心沥血
It is my third parent and my fourth child.

629
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,360
我在乎吗  我当然在乎
Do I care about it? Yes, I do care!

630
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,820
你们不会是在争执吧
I hope I don't hear sounds of a disagreement.

631
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,280
这就是纽约人对"讨论"的叫法吗
Oh, is that what they call discussion in New York?

632
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,920
我很高兴你们在吵架
Well, I'm glad you're fighting.

633
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,870
很高兴总算有人想起来抗争一下了
I'm glad somebody's putting up a fight.

634
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,210
你不是真的跟奶奶吵架吧  爸爸
You're not really fighting Granny, are you, Papa?

635
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,520
你们的奶奶也只是想有个万全之策
Your grandmother merely wishes to do the right thing.

636
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,710
我也一样
And so do I.

637
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,050
晚餐已经准备好了  夫人
Dinner is served, my lady.

638
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,220
还有谁也一直梦见泰坦尼克号吗
Does anyone else keep dreaming about the Titanic?

639
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,810
我老是梦见它  
I can't get it out of my mind.

640
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,600
不是吧  消停会吧
Not again. Give it a rest.

641
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,140
黛西  别再想这件事了
Daisy, it is time to let it go.

642
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,260
但是所有的人  
But all them people,

643
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,060
大半夜都冻死在冰冷的海水里
freezing to death in the midnight icy water.

644
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,190
你这语气跟那些廉价恐怖小说一样
Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

645
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,820
您在南非肯定见过更惨的吧  贝茨先生
I expect you saw worse things in South Africa. Eh, Mr. Bates?

646
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,860
谈不上更惨  但也够呛
Not worse, but pretty bad.

647
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,320
你很享受战争的感觉吗
Did you enjoy the war?

648
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,020
我想没人喜欢享受战争
I don't think anyone enjoys war,

649
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,950
但也有些不错的回忆
but there are some good memories, too.

650
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,450
我也确信肯定是有的
I'm sure there are.

651
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,410
贝茨先生  您能把那个托盘递给我吗
Mr. Bates, would you hand me that tray?

652
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,600
-该死  -我来吧
- Blast! - I'll do it.

653
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,630
抱歉
Sorry.

654
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,780
夫人小姐们已经吃完了  咖啡也上了
The ladies are out, we've given them coffee.

655
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,010
老爷带着葡萄酒进了书房
The Lordship's taken his port to the library.

656
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,760
安娜  格温  上楼帮忙收拾去
Anna, Gwen, go up and help clear away.

657
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,090
黛西  告诉帕特莫太太
Uh, Daisy, tell Mrs. Patmore

658
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,310
我们15分钟之后开饭
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

659
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,730
我老是记不住
Well, I keep forgetting.

660
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,950
这个是要放到隔壁还是拿回厨房
Does this go next door or back to the kitchen?

661
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,860
那些端回去  
Those go back,

662
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,990
甜点餐具和所有酒杯
but the dessert service and all the glasses

663
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,540
都放到楼上餐具室
stay in the upstairs pantry.

664
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,330
放在这里
Put it on here.

665
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,670
什么事
What is it?

666
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
夫人跟他说  
Her Ladyship's told him

667
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
她觉得贝茨先生该辞职走人
she thinks Mr. Bates ought to go.

668
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,030
她是这么跟我说的
She said to me,

669
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,220
"老爷一直用托马斯不就得了"
"If only his Lordship had been content with Thomas."

670
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,050
她真是这么说的吗
Did she really?

671
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,640
-你们在这儿干吗呢  -你管得着吗
- What are you doing up here? - It's a free country.

672
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,060
成啊  我要去吃饭了
Well, I'm going for my dinner.

673
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,650
你俩就在这儿继续  "运筹帷幄"吧
You two can stay here plotting.

674
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,670
这么说年轻的克罗伯勒公爵主动想来拜访
So, the Young Duke of Crowborough is asking himself to stay.

675
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,500
我们也清楚他此番前来所欲何为
And we know why.

676
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,040
你们自以为清楚而已 
You hope you know why.

677
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,050
现实可不总是随人所愿
That is not at all the same.

678
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,680
你认为公爵已察觉到玛丽的前景有所改观
You realise the Duke thinks Mary's prospects have altered.

679
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,180
-大概是吧  -什么叫大概是吧
- I suppose so. - There's no "Suppose" about it.

680
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,910
那是肯定以及一定的
Of course, this is exactly

681
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,430
只要我们能事事都以玛丽的利益为重
the sort of opportunity that will come to Mary

682
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,900
那么这就是玛丽千载难逢的好机会
if we can only get things settled in her favour.

683
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,440
-罗伯特回心转意了吗  -还没有
- Is Robert coming round? - Not yet.

684
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,510
他所担心的是
To him, the risk is

685
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,860
纵然保住我的钱  但家产却付之东流
we succeed in saving my money but not the estate.

686
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,330
要是唐顿庄园因他而败落
He feels he'd be betraying his duty

687
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,290
他会觉得甚是愧对先祖
if Downton were lost because of him.

688
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,690
好吧  那我给莫里写封信
Well, I'm going to write to Murray.

689
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,290
他也无计可施
He won't say anything different.

690
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,850
千里之行  始于足下  
Well, we have to start somewhere.

691
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,920
咱们要对玛丽负责
Our duty is to Mary.

692
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,850
等玛丽服完丧  
Well, give him a date

693
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,300
就安排他俩约会吧
for when Mary's out of mourning.

694
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,060
没人愿意跟穿丧服的姑娘谈情说爱
No one wants to kiss a girl in black.

695
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,060
别顾影自怜了
Oh, do stop admiring yourself.

696
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,730
你以为他娶你是贪图你的美貌吗
He's not marrying you for your looks.

697
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,990
再说娶不娶还不一定呢
That's if he wants to marry you at all.

698
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,450
他会娶我的
He will.

699
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,110
我觉得你很美   
I think you look beautiful.

700
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,570
谢谢你  茜玻  亲爱的
Thank you, Sybil darling.

701
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,600
咱们该下楼了
We should go down.

702
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,080
他们随时都会从车站回来
They'll be back from the station at any moment.

703
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,200
别太花枝招展  亲爱的
Hmm. Let's not gild the lily,dear.

704
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,080
还有  玛丽  尽量显得惊讶些
And Mary, try to look surprised.

705
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,420
都准备好了吗
You all ready?

706
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,470
很好  大家出门迎接客人吧
Very well. You should go out to greet them.

707
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,210
我也去吗  卡森先生  
And me, Mr. Carson?

708
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,590
不  黛西  你不能去
No, Daisy, not you.

709
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,930
你能行吗  贝茨先生  
Can you manage, Mr. Bates?

710
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,970
要不你在这儿等着
Or would you rather wait here?

711
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,180
我想出去  卡森先生
I want to go, Mr. Carson.

712
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,600
也没必要全体都出去迎接的
Well, there's no obligation for the whole staff to be present.

713
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,140
我很乐意去
I'd like to be there.

714
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,440
今天是唐顿庄园的大日子
Well, it's certainly a great day for Downton

715
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,190
因为要欢迎公爵的大驾光临
to welcome a Duke under our roof.

716
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,950
记得帮我抬行李  别想开溜
Remember to help me with the luggage. Don't go running off.

717
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,070
我来帮你吧
I'll give you a hand.

718
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,550
那怎么行  贝茨先生  
Oh, I couldn't ask that, Mr. Bates,

719
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,990
您腿脚恐怕不方便吧
not in your condition.

720
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,350
卡森先生  我只是想知道
How long do we have to put up with this,

721
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,120
我们究竟还要忍多久啊
Mr. Carson, just so I know?

722
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,240
欢迎光临唐顿庄园
Welcome to Downton.

723
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,240
格兰瑟姆夫人  感谢您的盛情邀请
Lady Grantham, this is so kind of you.

724
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,740
哪里哪里  公爵  
Not at all, Duke.

725
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,000
您百忙之中能光临寒舍自是荣幸之至
I'm delighted you could spare the time.

726
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,850
想必您认识小女玛丽  
You know my daughter Mary, of course.

727
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,900
-当然  玛丽小姐  -还有伊迪丝  
- Of course, Lady Mary. - And Edith,

728
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,710
我想你还从未见过幺女  茜玻
but I don't believe you've met my youngest, Sybil.

729
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,340
-茜玻小姐  -您好
- Ah! Lady Sybil. - How do you do?

730
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,010
快快请进  您舟车劳顿想必甚为疲惫
Come on in, you must be worn out.

731
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,010
格兰瑟姆夫人  我有个不情之请
Oh, Lady Grantham, I've a confession to make,

732
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,760
当然我希望不会给您添麻烦
which I hope won't cause too much bother.

733
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,770
我的贴身男仆在启程时生病了  所以我
My man has taken ill just as I was leaving, so I...

734
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,140
这个好办  是吧  卡森
Oh, well, that won't be a problem, will it, Carson?

735
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,750
当然
Certainly not.

736
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,270
就由小人亲自服侍尊贵的大人吧
I shall look after His Grace myself.

737
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,440
不行  我可不能这么大材小用
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of being such a nuisance.

738
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,520
不过是个男仆
Surely a footman...

739
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,610
我记得这个人
I remember this man.

740
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,810
格兰瑟姆夫人与我在伦敦共进晚餐时  
Didn't you serve me

741
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,320
是你侍奉的我吧
when I dined with Lady Grantham in London?

742
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,120
-是的  大人  -这就行了
- I did, Your Grace. - Ah, there we are.

743
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,030
我们应该会相处得不错  是吧那个
We shall do very well together, won't we...

744
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,540
-我叫托马斯  大人  -托马斯
- Uh, Thomas, Your Grace. - Thomas.

745
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,370
那好吧
Good.

746
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,790
您的旅途还算愉快吧
Hope you had a pleasant journey.

747
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,460
贝茨  你没事吧  
Bates, are you all right?

748
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,380
很好  老爷  对不起
Perfectly, my Lord. I apologise.

749
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,060
贝茨先生
Mr. Bates.

750
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,610
-这样好多了  -求你别来可怜我
- That's better. - Please, don't feel sorry for me.

751
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,740
我们该去干什么呢  你想去哪儿
What shall we do? What would you like to do?

752
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,120
我想到处转一转  参观一下
I think I'd rather like to go exploring.

753
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,170
没问题  去花园还是府邸里
Certainly. Gardens or house?

754
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,210
府邸吧  我觉得花园都千篇一律
Oh, house I think. Gardens are all the same to me.

755
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,570
很好  
Very well,

756
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,680
我们先从大厅开始  最古老的
we can begin in the hall, which is one of the oldest...

757
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,010
不  不要那些客厅藏书室
No, not all those drawing rooms and libraries.

758
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,680
那你想去哪儿
Well, what then?

759
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,870
我不知道  
I don't know.

760
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,980
比如秘密通道  小阁楼之类的
The... The secret passages and the attics.

761
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,320
听起来有些古怪  但有何不可呢
Well, it seems a bit odd but, why not?

762
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,460
我去跟妈妈说一声
I'll just tell Mama.

763
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,110
不  别告诉你母亲
No, don't tell your mama.

764
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,700
但我们又不是做什么坏事
But there's nothing wrong in it.

765
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,230
当然不是  我只是
No, indeed. I'm...

766
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,200
我只是不想有人来打扰我们
I'm only worried the others will want to join us.

767
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,880
玛丽在招待他
Mary's settling him in.

768
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,470
柯拉  别让玛丽太过于殷勤
Cora, don't let Mary make a fool of herself.

769
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,680
对了  下周我要去伦敦
By the way, I'll be going up to London next week.

770
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,810
要让人打扫一下房子吗
Do you want to open the house?

771
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,150
不用了  我就带着贝茨一起住俱乐部
No, no. I'll just take Bates and stay at the club.

772
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,570
差不多就待一两天吧
I won't be more than a day or two.

773
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,650
好的  事情有什么进展吗
I see. Are things progressing?

774
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,360
什么事情
What things?

775
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,160
不过是军队的晚宴而已
It's just a regimental dinner.

776
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,210
下午贝茨的那一跤可惜了整个迎接礼
It's a pity Bates spoilt the arrival this afternoon.

777
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,830
不算煞风景  他只是摔倒了而已
He didn't spoil anything. He fell over.

778
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,170
太不体面了  卡森最讨厌这种事
It was so undignified. Carson hates that kind of thing.

779
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,130
我才不管卡森怎么想
I don't care what Carson thinks.

780
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,300
老夫人来口信了  夫人
A message from the Dowager Countess, my lady.

781
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,140
她说她不来喝下午茶了
She says she won't come to tea,

782
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,220
但会来用晚餐
but she'll join you for dinner.

783
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,770
对了  卡森  但愿你今天下午没有太难堪
Oh, Carson, I hope you weren't embarrassed this afternoon.

784
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,060
我敢保证公爵他还是很感激你的接待
I can assure you the Duke very much appreciated his welcome.

785
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,560
我很高兴
I'm glad.

786
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,730
-贝茨没事了吧  -我想应该没事  老爷
- Is Bates all right? - I think so, my lord.

787
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,360
不管怎样  真是难为你了
It must be so difficult for you, all the same.

788
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,870
不要多事
Don't stir.

789
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,100
我们好像是第一次这样独处
Do you realise this is the first time we've ever been alone?

790
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,350
那你肯定是忘了
Then you've forgotten

791
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,270
在北布洛克斯家那次  我把你拉进温室
when I pulled you into the conservatory at the Northbrooks'.

792
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,100
-我真伤心  -不  我没有忘记
- How sad. - No, I haven't.

793
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,660
那次不一样
It's not quite the same

794
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,400
那时有好多女伴躲在树丛暗中窥觊
with 20 chaperones hiding behind every fern.

795
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,650
和我独处你开心吗  小姐
And are you pleased to be alone with me, my lady?

796
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,830
天哪  若我坦诚相告
Oh, dear, if I answer truthfully,

797
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,620
那就太不矜持了
you'll think me rather forward.

798
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,000
我们不该随便窥探  太失礼了
I don't think we should pry. It feels rather disrespectful.

799
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,750
胡说
Oh, nonsense.

800
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,970
这是你父亲的房子  不是吗
It's your father's house, isn't it?

801
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,930
你有权利知道房子里的一切
You've a right to know what goes on in it.

802
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,140
这通向哪儿
Where does this lead?

803
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,350
男仆的房间  从女仆这边上锁
To the men's quarters. With a lock on the women's side.

804
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,930
-只有休斯太太有权开锁  -休斯太太
- Only Mrs Hughes is allowed to turn it. - Mrs Hughes...

805
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,770
还有你
And you.

806
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,330
-这里是  -某位男仆的房间
- And here? - A footman, I imagine.

807
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,300
-这样合适吗  -有何不妥
- Should you do that? - Why not?

808
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,470
我  我在研究一种叫"男仆"的物种
I'm... I'm making a study on the genus "Footman".

809
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,800
首先我得了解他们的生活起居
I seek to know the creature's ways.

810
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,800
有人来了
Someone's coming!

811
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,680
能效劳吗  小姐
Can I help you, my lady?

812
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,310
我们只是随便看看
We were just exploring.

813
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,650
您是要找托马斯吗  大人
Were you looking for Thomas, Your Grace?

814
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,990
不  如玛丽小姐所说我们只是随便看看
No, as Lady Mary said, we've just been exploring.

815
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,370
那您想看看我的房间吗  小姐
Would you care to explore my room, my lady?

816
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,330
不用了  贝茨  很抱歉打扰你了
Of course not, Bates. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

817
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,500
我们马上就下去
We were just going down.

818
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,630
为什么要向那个人道歉
Why did you apologise to that man?

819
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,680
他无权干涉我们
It's not his business what we do.

820
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,520
犯了错就道歉
I always apologise when I'm in the wrong.

821
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,900
这是我的习惯
It's a habit of mine.

822
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,980
事实表明  尽管贝茨先生无过
The plain fact is Mr Bates, through no fault of his own,

823
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:00,530
但他无法完成应担的额外工作
is not able to fulfil the extra duties expected of him.

824
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,350
他不能提重物  更不能侍奉用餐
He can't lift. He can't serve a table.

825
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,330
还四处乱掉东西
He's dropping things all over the place.

826
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,540
比如今晚  他就该充当第三男仆
On a night like tonight he should act as a third footman.

827
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,750
而事实上  老爷
As it is, my lord,

828
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,880
我们今晚只能找个女仆来顶替
we may have to have a maid in the dining room.

829
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,130
放松点  卡森
Cheer up, Carson,

830
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,420
这也不算太糟糕
there are worse things happening in the world.

831
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,090
让女仆侍奉公爵还不够糟
Not worse than a maid serving a duke.

832
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,730
这么说你心意已决
So you're quite determined?

833
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,600
这决定很难  老爷  我也是不得已
It's a hard decision, your lordship. A very hard decision.

834
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,370
但这有损唐顿的名誉
But the honour of Downton is at stake.

835
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,730
别担心  卡森
Don't worry, Carson.

836
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,450
为了唐顿的名誉
I know all about hard decisions

837
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,320
我知道该怎么舍小为大
when it comes to the honour of Downton.

838
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,280
是吧  小家伙
Don't I, boy?

839
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,040
威廉  你不能总让托马斯占你便宜
William, you mustn't let Thomas take advantage.

840
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,630
他跟你一样  也只是个男仆
He's only a footman, same as you.

841
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,230
没事的  休斯太太  
It's all right, Mrs Hughes.

842
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,520
我喜欢充实点
I like to keep busy.

843
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,470
这样就不至于胡思乱想
It takes your mind off things.

844
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,840
胡思乱想些什么
What things have you got to take your mind off?

845
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,680
想家也没什么可害臊的
If you're feeling homesick, there's no shame in it.

846
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,600
-是的  -说明你有一个幸福的家庭
- No. - It means you come from a happy home.

847
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,280
很多人羡慕都来不及呢
There's plenty of people here would envy that.

848
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,940
知道了  休斯太太
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

849
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,580
-您还有何吩咐  老爷  -没有
- Will that be all, my lord? - Yes.

850
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,460
其实  还有点事
That is... Not exactly.

851
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,960
下午摔了一跤没事吧
Have you recovered from your fall this afternoon?

852
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,530
实在抱歉  老爷
I'm very sorry about that, my lord.

853
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,180
也不知怎么了
I don't know what happened.

854
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,730
是这样  贝茨
The thing is, Bates,

855
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,520
我答应让你试试  也给了你机会
I said I'd give you a trial and I have.

856
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,730
可有些事由不得我
If it were only up to me...

857
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,360
贴身侍从也该承担额外的职责
It's this question of a valet's extra duties.

858
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,690
您是指有大型宴会时侍奉用餐吗
You mean waiting a table when there's a large party?

859
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,450
还包括提箱子等等
That and carrying things and...

860
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,430
你也知道卡森决不允许
You do see that Carson can't be

861
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,210
他的手下效率低下
expected to compromise the efficiency of his staff.

862
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,750
明白  老爷  我当然明白
I do, my lord, of course I do.

863
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,420
我有个提议
Might I make a suggestion?

864
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,500
若需额外男仆时
That when an extra footman is required,

865
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,960
他的工钱从我工资里扣
the cost could come out of my wages.

866
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,590
不行  我决不允许
Absolutely not. I couldn't possibly allow that.

867
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,770
可我很想留下来  老爷  
Because I am very eager to stay, my lord.

868
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,720
真的很想
Very eager, indeed.

869
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:36,390
我知道  我也很希望你能留下来
I know you are. And I was eager that this should work.

870
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,070
像我这样的很难再找到工作了
You see, it is unlikely that I should find another position.

871
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,030
房子小些  责任轻些的工作肯定行
But surely in a smaller house, where less is expected of you.

872
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,700
也不太可能
It's not likely.

873
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,910
在你找到工作前我会帮助你
I mean to help until you find something.

874
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,200
我不能要您的钱  老爷
I couldn't take your money, my lord.

875
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,830
除非那是我的劳动所得
I can take wages for a job done. That's all.

876
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,760
好吧  老爷  我马上走
Very good, my lord. I'll go at once.

877
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,730
不必急着今晚走
There's no need to rush out into the night.

878
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,600
搭明早九点的火车去伦敦吧
Take the London train tomorrow. It leaves at 9:00.

879
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,970
我会多给你一个月的工资  千万收下
You'll have a month's wages, too. That I insist on.

880
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,120
我也不想这样  贝茨
It's a bloody business, Bates,

881
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,820
实在是别无他法
but I can't see any way around it.

882
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,360
我理解  老爷
I quite understand, my lord.

883
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,670
看来今晚是女士之夜了  公爵
I'm afraid we're rather a female party tonight, Duke.

884
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,960
但是你也知道
But you know what it's

885
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,590
乡下总是女多男少
like trying to balance numbers in the country.

886
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,340
单身汉在这里可是众星捧月
A single man outranks the Holy Grail.

887
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,550
不  能与您一家共进晚餐实在荣幸之至
No, I'm terribly flattered to be dining en famille.

888
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,600
下午您和玛丽在小阁楼做什么呢
What were you and Mary doing in the attics this afternoon?

889
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,730
我想玛丽只是带公爵到处看看而已  对吧
I expect Mary was just showing the Duke the house. Weren't you?

890
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,650
-您是学建筑的吗  -没错
- Are you a student of architecture? - Mmm, absolutely.

891
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,910
那我诚挚希望您能光临寒舍
Then I do hope you'll come and inspect my little cottage.

892
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,720
那是雷恩大师为第一任伯爵的妹妹设计建造的
It was designed by Wren for the first earl's sister.

893
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,200
小阁楼
The attics?

894
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,040
没错  玛丽带着公爵上了小阁楼
Yes. Mary took the Duke up to the attics.

895
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,080
去那做什么
Whatever for?

896
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,130
亲爱的  怎么回事
Why was this, dear?

897
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,000
我们就是随处参观
We were just looking around.

898
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:31,260
参观  仆人的房间有什么可看的
Looking around? What is there to look at but servants' rooms?

899
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,220
到底是为什么呢
What was the real reason, hmm?

900
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,510
别絮絮叨叨的  伊迪丝
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith.

901
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,180
我看大家都吃完了
I think we'll go through.

902
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:44,100
-我还是不懂  -少说几句行吗
- I still don't understand... - Will you hold your tongue!

903
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,820
还要等多久  我快饿死了
How long do you think they'll be? I'm starving.

904
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,250
夫人小姐们都安顿好了吗
Have you settled the ladies?

905
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,490
是的  卡森管家
Yes, Mr Carson.

906
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,120
那就不会太久了
Then it won't be long once they go through.

907
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,370
你们觉得他会求婚吗
You think he'll speak out?

908
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,250
想想看我们就要有个公爵夫人伺候了
Do you think we'll have a duchess to wait on? Imagine that.

909
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,460
那也轮不到你来伺候
You won't be waiting on her, whatever happens.

910
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,160
格兰瑟姆伯爵的长女和继承人
There is no reason why the eldest daughter

911
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,780
成为公爵夫人
and heiress of the Earl of Grantham

912
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,010
再合适不过了
should not wear a duchess's coronet with honour.

913
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,390
继承人  已经决定了吗  卡森先生
Heiress, Mr Carson? Has it been decided?

914
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,850
世间若还有公道  她理应继承
It will be, if there's any justice in the world.

915
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,350
好吧  分晓不久便知
Well, we'll know soon enough.

916
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,520
你在干什么  安娜
What are you doing, Anna?

917
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,410
我想拿点吃的给贝茨先生
I thought I'd take something up to Mr Bates,

918
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,900
他不舒服没下来吃饭
him not being well enough to come down.

919
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,310
您不介意吧  休斯太太
You don't mind, do you, Mrs Hughes?

920
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,320
我没意见  但仅此一次
I don't mind. Not this once.

921
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,080
去吧  给他送吃的吧
No, take him whatever he might need.

922
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,710
贝茨先生的离开与他的品性无关
Mr Bates is leaving without a stain on his character.

923
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,250
我希望你们与他道别时注意分寸
I hope you all observe that in the manner of your parting.

924
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,640
我不明白他为什么要走
Well, I don't see why he has to go.

925
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,130
我不介意多做一些...
I don't mind doing a bit of extra work...

926
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,050
这不是你能决定的
It's not up to you.

927
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,970
让我来服侍老爷  卡森先生  行吗
I'll take care of his lordship. Shall I, Mr Carson?

928
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,470
不行  你还得照顾公爵
Not while you're looking after the Duke, you won't.

929
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,680
还是我自己来伺候吧
I'll see to his lordship myself.

930
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,840
贝茨先生  你在吗
Mr Bates? Are you there?

931
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,030
怕你饿着  我给你端了点吃的
I brought something up, in case you were hungry.

932
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,950
你真好  谢谢
That's very kind.

933
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,000
-很遗憾你要走了  -我会没事的
- I'm ever so sorry you're going. - I'll be all right.

934
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,340
那是当然
Of course you will.

935
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,850
以你的为人  总能找到容身之处
There's always a place for a man like you.

936
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:25,140
没错  总会有办法的
Oh, yes. Something will turn up.

937
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,350
安顿好了  记得告诉我们
Tell us when you're fixed.

938
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,520
写封信来
Just... drop us a line.

939
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,940
不然我会担心的
Else I'll worry.

940
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,820
放心吧
Well, we can't have that.

941
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,930
咱们该让仆人进来收拾了
We must go and let the servants get in here.

942
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,540
若能再逗留片刻  我将不胜感激
I should be grateful if we could stay just a minute more.

943
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,060
还有些事想请教
I have... I have something to ask you.

944
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,610
对于您兄侄的遭遇  我深表哀悼
I was terribly sorry to hear about your cousins.

945
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,110
这样
You said.

946
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,350
-您认识他们  -不太熟
- Did you know them? - Not well.

947
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,910
也就见过帕特里克·卡劳利几次
I used to see Patrick Crawley at the odd thing.

948
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,000
府上遭受如此巨变肯定需要时间适应
I imagine it will mean some adjustments for you all.

949
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,000
一夜之间  失去两位继承人  太可怕了
To lose two heirs in one night, it's terrible.

950
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,010
-是啊  很可怕  -真不幸
- Indeed, it was terrible. - Awful.

951
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,600
但话说回来  祸兮福所倚
But then again, it's an ill wind.

952
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:54,100
至少现在玛丽小姐的未来不可限量
At least Lady Mary's prospects must have rather improved.

953
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,820
是吗
Have they?

954
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,400
不是吗
Haven't they?

955
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,150
恕我直言
I will not be coy

956
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,820
我不想假装没听出您的弦外之音
and pretend I do not understand your meaning,

957
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:10,160
似乎您对我家的私事洞若观火
though you seem very informed on this family's private affairs.

958
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,740
那您也该知道此事
But you ought perhaps to know

959
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,170
我无意打破限定继承权
that I do not intend to fight the entail.

960
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,210
毫无此意
Not any part of it.

961
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,710
您不是说真的吧
You can't be serious.

962
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,470
尽管艰难  但我确无此意
It pains me to say it, but I am.

963
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,810
您要放弃所有家产吗
You'll give up your entire estate?

964
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,850
将您夫人的财产也交给一个陌生人吗
Your wife's money into the bargain, to a perfect stranger?

965
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,860
您都不反抗吗
You won't even put up a fight?

966
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,920
我希望他是个完美的继承人
I hope he proves to be perfect,

967
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,400
但我很怀疑
but I'd rather doubt it.

968
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,530
拿这种事说笑  够古怪
Very odd thing to joke about.

969
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,160
这场谈话  更古怪
No odder than this conversation.

970
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,000
给你的答复如下
So, there you have it.

971
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,830
留给玛丽的那部分财产依旧
But Mary will still have her settlement,

972
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,290
您不会嫌少的
which you won't find ungenerous.

973
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,420
-您说什么  -我的意思是
- I'm sorry? - I only meant that

974
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,970
她嫁妆的价值相当可观
her portion, when she marries, will be more than respectable.

975
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,300
-您会满意的  我保证  -天哪
- You'll be pleased, I promise you. - Oh, heavens.

976
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,330
真希望  您没有会错我的意
I hope I haven't given the wrong impression.

977
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,060
您心里清楚
You know very well...

978
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,390
-我尊敬的格兰瑟姆伯爵  -别给我来这套
- My dear Lord Grantham... - Don't "My dear Lord Grantham" Me!

979
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,730
此行的目的  您心知肚明
You knew what you were doing when you came here.

980
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,360
您让玛丽以及我们所有人都以为
You encouraged Mary, all of us, into thinking...

981
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,880
对不起  我来此
Forgive me, but I came

982
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,700
只是为了表达我的哀悼以及友好
to express my sympathies and my friendship.

983
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,200
别无他意
Nothing more.

984
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,130
玛丽小姐是位迷人的女士
Lady Mary is a charming person.

985
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,790
谁娶了她都很幸运
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

986
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,250
但那不会是我
It will not, however, be me.

987
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:41,630
懂了  那您留我在此  是要问我什么
I see, and what was it you asked me to stay behind to hear?

988
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,340
我  我忘了
I... I forget.

989
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,150
您不来客厅了吗
Well, aren't you coming into the drawing room?

990
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:06,130
我累了
I'm... I'm tired.

991
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,060
失陪
I think I'll just slip away.

992
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,990
麻烦替我致歉
Please make my excuses.

993
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,560
看来你今天累坏了
I'm afraid I've worn you out.

994
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,740
明天我们就...
Tomorrow we can just...

995
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,750
我明早就告辞
I'm leaving in the morning.

996
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,040
晚安
Good night.

997
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,380
麻烦你告诉那位男仆
Oh, you might tell that footman...

998
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:26,130
-托马斯  -托马斯  告诉他我回房歇息了
- Thomas. - Thomas. You might tell him I've gone up.

999
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,110
金龟婿没上钩吗
So he slipped the hook?

1000
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,200
至少我没有坐以待毙
At least I'm not fishing with no bait.

1001
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,290
难以置信
I don't believe that.

1002
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,960
你爱信不信  他不会推翻限定继承权的
Well, believe what you like. He won't break the entail.

1003
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,180
未知的堂弟将继承一切
The unknown cousin gets everything

1004
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,890
玛丽分得的遗产还是那么多
and Mary's inheritance will be the same as it always was.

1005
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,930
我怎么知道  那个律师来  我还以为
Oh, how was I to know? When the lawyer turned up, I thought...

1006
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,270
你是没法知道  给我发电报是对的
You weren't to and you did the right thing to telegraph me.

1007
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,560
-只是事情未能如愿  -那现在怎么办
- It's just not going to come off. - So what now?

1008
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:28,610
你知道我的使命决不会变
Well, you know how I'm fixed.

1009
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,680
我得娶一位继承人
I have to have an heiress,

1010
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,490
为此奔赴纽约也在所不惜
if it means going to New York to find one.

1011
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,490
那我怎么办
What about me?

1012
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,340
你
You...

1013
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,500
你祝我顺风就好
You will wish me well.

1014
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,960
你说过  如果我想离开  你会给我找份工
You said you'd find me ajob if I wanted to leave.

1015
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,510
你想离开吗
And do you?

1016
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,830
我想当贴身侍从
I want to be a valet.

1017
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:52,800
我受够了男仆的工作
I'm sick of being a footman.

1018
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,510
托马斯  我不需要贴身侍从
Yeah, Thomas, I don't need a valet.

1019
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,770
我以为你要赶走新来的那个呢
I thought you were getting rid of the new one here.

1020
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:00,640
已经赶走了
And I've done it,

1021
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,400
但我不确定卡森是否会让我接任
but I'm not sure Carson's going to let me take over.

1022
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,070
我想跟你在一起
And I want to be with you.

1023
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,790
我看不到咱俩的未来  你呢
I just can't see it working, can you?

1024
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,390
我们之间似乎没有
We don't seem to have the basis

1025
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,880
发展主仆恋情的可能  不是吗
of a servant-master relationship, do we?

1026
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,800
你来此不就是为了与我相会
You came here to be with me.

1027
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,470
还有别的目的
Among other reasons.

1028
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,100
记住孤燕不成夏
And one swallow doesn't make a summer.

1029
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,040
-你是不是忘了什么  -什么
- Aren't you forgetting something? - What?

1030
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,210
你这是威胁我吗
Are you threatening me?

1031
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,960
一段年少无知的风流韵事
Because of a youthful dalliance?

1032
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,050
伦敦社交忙季的数周缱绻
A few weeks of madness in a London season?

1033
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,970
你不会要拿这些事威胁我吧
You wouldn't hold that against me, surely?

1034
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,010
困兽犹斗  何况是人
I would if I have to.

1035
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,890
谁会相信一个贪婪男仆指证公爵的话
And who'd believe a greedy footman over the words of a duke?

1036
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,360
你若不谨慎行事  小心牢狱之灾
If you're not careful, you'll end up behind bars.

1037
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,610
我有证据
I've got proof.

1038
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,610
你是指这些书信
You mean these?

1039
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,010
我母亲一直叮嘱我
You know, my mother's always telling me

1040
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,720
别留下白纸黑字的明证
never put anything in writing.

1041
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,720
如今  多亏了你  我会引以为戒的
And now, thanks to you, I never will again.

1042
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,260
你怎么拿到的
How did you get them?

1043
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:03,900
你这个混蛋
You bastard.

1044
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,060
别一失算就气急败坏  托马斯
Don't be a bad loser, Thomas.

1045
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,730
睡觉去吧
Go to bed.

1046
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,150
除非你想留下过夜
Unless you want to stay.

1047
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,390
我要睡了
I think I'll turn in.

1048
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,850
-没什么重要消息吗  -没有
- No big announcement, then? - No.

1049
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,060
也不可能有了  他乘明早九点的火车离开
Nor likely to be. He's off on the 9:00 train.

1050
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,610
他怎么能这样
He never is!

1051
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:56,480
为了明日的晚宴  我们都宰好了一只火鸡呢
And when we've had a turkey killed for tomorrow's dinner!

1052
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:59,820
-她到底做错了什么  -她没错
- I wonder what she did wrong. - She did nothing wrong.

1053
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,780
听老爷那口气  她应该没错
Not from the way his lordship was talking.

1054
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,040
真不知公爵大人的礼数教养都到哪里去了
So His Grace turned out to be graceless.

1055
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,210
晚安  休斯太太
Good night, Mrs Hughes.

1056
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,250
晚安  卡森先生
Good night, Mr Carson.

1057
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,260
既然你意已决  何必让玛丽卷进来
If you knew that was your decision, why put Mary through it?

1058
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,800
我之前还犹豫不决
But I didn't know it was my decision,

1059
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,340
直到今晚  才最终决定
my final decision, until tonight.

1060
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,550
我觉得  我不能为了玛丽
But I find I cannot ruin the estate

1061
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,810
破坏这份家业  辱没这个头衔
or hollow out the title for the sake of Mary,

1062
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,430
就算她嫁个更好的人也不行
even with a better man than that.

1063
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,020
我无论如何也理解不了
I try to understand. I just can't.

1064
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,150
不理解也罢  唐顿是我的家族祖业
Well, why should you? Downton is in my blood and in my bones.

1065
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,860
又不是你的
It's not in yours.

1066
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,990
我不能成为一个卖国贼
And I can no more be the cause of its destruction

1067
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,150
也决不能成为败家子
than I could betray my country.

1068
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,580
再说  之前我又不知道
Besides, how was I to know

1069
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,070
他只是冲着整个家产来的
he wouldn't take her without the money?

1070
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,490
别得了便宜还卖乖
Don't pretend to be a child because it suits you.

1071
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,500
你觉得她跟慕钱而来的人结婚会幸福吗
Do you think she would've been happy with a fortune hunter?

1072
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,370
也许会呢
She might've been.

1073
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:54,000
我就很幸福
I was.

1074
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,340
你真的幸福吗
Have you been happy?

1075
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,170
我真让你觉得幸福吗
Really, have I made you happy?

1076
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,630
真的
Yes.

1077
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,540
你爱上我的那刻起  幸福就开始了
That is, since you fell in love with me,

1078
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,730
如果我没记错的话
which, if I remember correctly,

1079
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,310
大概是我们结婚一年后
was about a year after we were married.

1080
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,310
没有一年  没那么长时间
Not a year. Not as long as that.

1081
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,900
但这种好事不一定会落在玛丽身上
But it wouldn't have happened for Mary.

1082
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,760
为什么
Why not?

1083
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,910
我这人可比克罗伯勒公爵好多了
Because I am so much nicer than the Duke of Crowborough.

1084
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,820
这得我说了算
I'll be the judge of that.

1085
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:33,830
别以为我会袖手旁观  罗伯特
Just don't think I'm going to let it rest, Robert.

1086
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,460
我不达目的  誓不罢休
I haven't given up by any means.

1087
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,800
-我做事得对得起自己的良心  -我也是
- I must do what my conscience tells me. - And so must I.

1088
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,930
还有  你别以为我会就此罢休
And I don't want you to think I'll let it rest.

1089
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,740
老爷  可否让贝茨
My lord, would it be acceptable

1090
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,030
与泰勒在前座将就下
for Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

1091
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,320
否则就得另外备车了
Otherwise, it means getting the other car out.

1092
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,830
他和公爵大人赶的是同一班火车
He and His Grace are catching the same train.

1093
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,740
完全可以
Perfectly acceptable.

1094
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,210
公爵大人就算不乐意  也只能将就下了
And if His Grace doesn't like it, he can lump it.

1095
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,970
格兰瑟姆夫人  您实在太客气了  谢谢
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham. Thank you.

1096
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,720
再见  公爵
Goodbye, Duke.

1097
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,520
烦请您替我向令媛道个别
You'll make my farewells to your delightful daughters?

1098
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,940
她们若知道您现在就走  定会亲自相送
They'd have been down if they'd known you were leaving so soon.

1099
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,320
确实有突发急事  不得不走
Alas, something's come up which has taken me quite by surprise.

1100
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,860
看得出来
Obviously.

1101
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,110
格兰瑟姆  贵宅小住非常愉快
Well, Grantham, this has been a highly enjoyable interlude.

1102
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,530
是吗  我还担心是否让您失望了
Has it? And I feared it had proved a disappointment.

1103
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,820
怎么会  完全没有
Not at all, not at all.

1104
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,370
小住一日  得知你们都好  我就安心多了
A short stay in your lovely house has driven away my cares.

1105
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:56,410
老爷  要赶上这班火车的话  我们得走了
We ought to go, my lord, if His Grace is to catch the train.

1106
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,340
再见  贝茨  祝你好运
Goodbye, Bates, and good luck.

1107
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,090
也祝您好运  老爷
Good luck to you, my lord.

1108
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,980
等等
Wait!

1109
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,200
-贝茨  下车  -我真不能误了这班火车
- Get out, Bates. - I really mustn't be late.

1110
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,500
回屋去  解雇的事绝不再提了
Get back inside and we'll say no more about it.

1111
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,720
卡森  不该让他走
It wasn't right, Carson.

1112
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,890
不该赶他走的
I just didn't think it was right.

1113
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,080
-夫人  急件  -谢谢  艾伦
- First post, ma'am. - Thank you, Ellen.

1114
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,580
-这封是你的  -谢谢  母亲
- One for you. - Thank you, Mother.

1115
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,030
是格兰瑟姆伯爵寄来的
Oh, it's from Lord Grantham.

1116
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,520
真的吗  他有什么事会找你
Really? What on earth does he want?

1117
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,690
他想要改变我们的命运
He wants to change our lives.
