00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:07,985
我不想的
 I don't.

600
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:12,800
告诉我你今天做了些什么吧
 Tell me what you did today.

601
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:16,765
我起床
 I got up.

602
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,298
帮我丈夫做早餐 对了
I fixed breakfast for my husband.  There.

603
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:23,735
我们可以说一下你丈夫的事情
 There's something we could have a conversation about your husband.

604
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,480
噢 他
 Oh. Him.

606
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,941
我不知道你是怎么应付过来的
 I don't know anything about how you work this.

607
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,153
你晚上离开屋子的时候和他说什么的？
 What do you say to him when you leave the house at night?

608
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:33,745
没什么 他睡着了
 Nothing. He's asleep.

609
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:35,187
每次都是？
 Always?

610
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:37,017
你回来的时候不会吵醒他？
 Doesn't he wake up when you come home?

611
00:47:39,128 --> 00:47:41,119
我们有不同的卧室
 We have separate bedrooms.

612
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:42,631
噢 是这样
 Oh, I see.

614
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:48,897
我不是想多管闲事 但你们似乎不是一起睡觉的
I don't like to seem like I' m prying, but I guess you don't sleep together.

616
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,630
这样有多久了？
How long has this been going on?

617
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,700
好了别说这个了 等一等
For god's sake, let's drop this.   Wait a minute.

618
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:56,208
你为什么嫁给他？
 Why did you marry him?

619
00:47:56,879 --> 00:47:58,312
看你能不能猜到了
 See if you can guess.

621
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,318
认真想想吧 班杰明
 Think real hard, Benjamin.

624
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:17,933
不要告诉伊琳
Don't tell Elaine.

625
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:20,996
噢 不 你嫁给他是因为你怀孕了
 Oh, no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant.

626
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:22,868
你很震惊吗？
 Are you shocked?

627
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:27,574
我从来没想到罗宾森先生 和你是那种...
 I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

628
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,272
好了 我们睡觉吧
 All right now, let's get to bed.

629
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,076
等等
 Wait a minute.

630
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,641
那是怎样发生的？
 So how did it happen?

631
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,543
什么？你和罗宾森先生
What? You and Mr. Robinson.

634
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,925
他那时是读法律的吗？ 是的
Was he a law student at the time?  Mm- hmm.

635
00:48:46,496 --> 00:48:49,056
你那时也是学生吗？是的
 And you were a student also?  Mm- hmm.

636
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,765
在大学？
 At college?

637
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,791
是的
 Yes.

638
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:55,699
你主修什么？
 What was your major?

639
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:03,002
班杰明 为什么你要问这些问题？
 Benjamin, why are you asking me all these questions?

640
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:05,410
因为我想知道啊 罗宾森太太
 Because I' m interested, Mrs. Robinson.

641
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:07,812
你读大学时主修什么？
 What was your major subject at college?

642
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,116
艺术 艺术？
Art.   Art?

643
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:16,121
我还以为你...
 But I thought you...

644
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:24,759
那 我看这些年来 你已经对它失去兴趣了吧
 I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years, then.

645
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:27,733
应该是吧
 Kind of.

646
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,572
那是怎样发生的？
 Well, how did it happen?

647
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:35,007
什么？ 你和罗宾森先生
What? You and Mr. Robinson.

648
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:37,144
你认为呢？
 How do you think?

649
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:39,271
你带他来这个房间的吗？
 Did you take you up to his room with him?

650
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:40,679
你们去酒店的吗？
 Did you go to a hotel?

651
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,047
噢 班 那有什么重要的吗？
 Oh, Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?

652
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:44,380
我很好奇
 I'm curious.

653
00:49:44,954 --> 00:49:47,752
我们上了他的车 噢不
We'd go to his car.   Oh, no.

654
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:49,690
你们在车上做的？
 In the car you did it?

655
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,717
我想我们不是第一个这样的
I don't think we were the first.

656
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:53,626
那是什么车？
 What kind of car was it?

657
00:49:55,765 --> 00:49:56,925
什么？
 What?

658
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,162
还记得那是什么车吗？
 Do you remember the make of the car?

659
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:02,427
噢天啊 我真的想知道
Oh, my god.  Really, I want to know.

660
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:04,540
是福特 本杰明
 It was a ford, Benjamin.

661
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:06,074
福特
 A ford.

662
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:10,712
福特 该死的 很不错啊
 A ford. God damn it, that's great.

663
00:50:11,581 --> 00:50:13,139
够了
 That's enough.

665
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:23,121
不要说伊琳
 Don't talk about Elaine.

666
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:24,818
不要说伊琳？
 Don't talk about Elaine?

667
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:26,488
是的
 No.

668
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:28,654
为什么不？
 Why not?

671
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,193
我想你来告诉我
 I wish you'd tell me.

672
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:35,827
没什么好说的
 There's nothing to tell.

674
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:44,213
看来我要约伊琳出来问清楚
I guess I' II have to ask her out on a date and find out what the big deal is.

675
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:48,115
班杰明 你不许和她约会
 Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

676
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:49,650
你明白了吗？
 Do you understand that?

677
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:51,844
我无意约她出来的
 I have no intention of taking her out.

678
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,123
好
 Good.

679
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:58,723
我只是开个玩笑
 I was just kidding around.

680
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:02,931
好
 Good.

683
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,199
不行
 No.

686
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:21,245
我甚至配不上说起她 对吗？
 I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?

687
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:23,352
不要再说了 不说不行
Let's drop it.   We're not dropping it.

688
00:51:23,386 --> 00:51:26,150
我配得上你 但配不起和你女儿有联系
 I'm good enough for you, but I' m not good enough to associate with your daughter.

689
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:27,847
就是这样 是吗？班杰明
That's it, isn't it? Benjamin.

690
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,424
是吗？
 Isn't it?

691
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:43,368
是的
 Yes.

694
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,636
你以为我为这种事骄傲吗？  我不想知道
Do you think I' m proud of this?  I wouldn't know.

698
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,584
我明白了
 I see.

699
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:03,386
如果你以为我是因为寂寞 才来找你就大错特错了
 If you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom than you're all wrong.

700
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:05,253
那是因为罗宾森太太
 'Cause, Mrs. Robinson,

701
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:08,088
这是我做过的 最令自己恶心的事情
 this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

702
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:10,788
你做到了你想做的事 但我却在受罪
 You do what you want, but I' m getting the hell out.

703
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,662
是吗？
 Are you?

706
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:22,841
别开始 什么？
don't start this.   What?

707
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:24,943
别开始扮作伤心
 Don't start acting hurt.

708
00:52:25,114 --> 00:52:27,139
你不希望我会有一点伤心吗？
 Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

710
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,511
我有那样说吗？
Did I say that?

713
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,864
两分钟前你说 我配不上你女儿
2 minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

715
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:47,095
我无意的
 I didn't mean it.

716
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:49,431
我认为你们是合不来的
 I don't think you'd be right for each other.

717
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:53,165
但我不认为你比不上她
 I'd never say you aren't as good a person as she is.

720
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:04,475
你在做什么？
 What are you doing?

723
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,698
刚才我有点不知所措
 I was kind of upset there.

724
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,100
我为我说的话道歉
 I'm sorry I said those things.

725
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,103
没关系
 It's all right.

726
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:25,104
我知道自己为什么如此让你讨厌
 I think I can understand why I' m disgusting to you.

727
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:27,373
噢 不
 Oh, no.

728
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:32,809
我喜欢你 不然我不会来这里
I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

729
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:35,507
但那不是令你很难受的吗？
 But if it's sickening for you?

730
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:37,016
不是
 It's not.

732
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,960
你不必这样说
 You don't have to say that.

735
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:54,393
那我可以留下来吗？
 May I stay, then?

737
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,039
谢谢 不必谢我
Thank you. Well, don't.

740
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:10,713
我想你作出承诺
 I want you to promise me that.

742
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,980
我不会和她约会的
 It never occurred to me to take her out.

743
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:16,649
那就保证你不会吧！
 Then give me your word you won't!

744
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:19,422
真有点荒唐
 This is absurd.

745
00:54:20,062 --> 00:54:21,723
答应我 班杰明
 Promise me, Benjamin.

746
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:24,359
好的 我保证
 All right, I promise.

748
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,529
谢谢
 Thank you.

750
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,146
不要再说了
 Let's not talk at all.

751
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:20,885
伊琳很快就回来了
 Elaine's back home soon.

752
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,918
我想应该是你 和她约会的好时机了
 I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out.

754
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:42,943
伊琳和我是合不来的
Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.

758
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:52,284
这和那没有关系
 That has nothing to do with it.

759
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:54,379
我应该告诉罗宾森先生...
I' II just have to tell Mr. Robinson...

769
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:41,561
你好
 Hello.

771
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,372
进来吧 班
 Ben, come on in.

772
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:49,138
我想那年轻小姐还没准备好呢
 I'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet.

774
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,706
还是喝威士忌吗？  波旁酒
Scotch still your drink?  Bourbon.

779
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:30,343
班杰明 我想我已经讲得很清楚的了
 Benjamin, I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.

782
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:39,558
我想我应付不了那样
I' m afraid I couldn't handle that.

783
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:44,758
我不会再约你的宝贝女儿出去的
I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again,

786
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:53,671
你好
 Hello.

787
00:57:54,143 --> 00:57:55,542
你好
 Hello.

790
00:58:13,462 --> 00:58:15,487
你现在住在家里 对吗？
 You're living at home now, is that right?

00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:16,859
是的
 Yes.

793
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:21,233
没有
 No.

794
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:26,432
你想读研究生吗？
 Are you going to graduate school?

795
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:28,102
不
 No.

796
00:58:33,983 --> 00:58:36,110
你总是这样驾车的吗？
 Do you always drive like this?

797
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:37,344
是的
 Yes.

798
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,867
请坐
 Sit down.

799
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:20,021
你为什么不看表演？
 Why don't you watch the show?

800
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:26,718
班杰明 你是不是讨厌我？
 Benjamin, do you dislike me for some reason?

802
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:31,763
我不知道
 I don't know.

804
01:00:45,747 --> 01:00:47,476
你觉得怎样？
 How do you like that?

805
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:52,348
你可以那样做吗？
 Could you do it?

806
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:57,455
去啊宝贝！
 Go, baby, go!

807
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:16,944
停！ 喂！
 Stop!  Hey!

808
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:27,755
伊琳 对不起
 Elaine, I' m sorry.

809
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:30,047
伊琳
 Elaine.

810
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,323
送我回家好吗？
 Would you take me home now?

813
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:43,269
伊琳
 Elaine.

814
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:44,772
车在哪里？
 Where's the car?

815
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:46,467
我想和你说一些话
 I just want to tell you something.

816
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:51,846
我要回家
 I want to go home.

818
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:55,975
什么？
 What?

820
01:01:58,787 --> 01:02:00,220
他们逼我这样做的
 They forced me into it.

821
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:02,755
很感谢你告诉我
 That's very nice of you to tell me.

823
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:07,793
我不是那样的人 
 I'm not like this.

824
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,330
请你不要再哭了好吗？
could you just stop crying, please?

825
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:16,028
我忍不住
 No, I couldn't.

826
01:02:16,104 --> 01:02:17,867
你试一下好吗？  不行啊

只是我的一个客人 现在没事了

她很压抑 叫了一声 但现在好了

我去报警 喂 等一等

我不想再发生这种事
 We won't have any more of this agitation.

我要你搬走
 I want you out of here.

1054
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,602
为什么？因为我不喜欢你
What for? Because I don't like you.

1058
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,688
伊琳 我现在不想说什么
Elaine, right now I don't feel like talking much.

1061
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:50,016
你现在有什么打算？
 What are you going to do now?

01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,963
伊琳 你不要再问了
 Elaine, you're going to have to stop asking me that.

1067
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:23,680
我不明白
 I don't understand.

1068
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:25,752
在你有明确的方向之前...我不想你去任何地方
 I don't want you to go anywhere... Until you have a definite plan.

亲我一下好吗？
 Will you kiss me?

1074
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,267
你愿意嫁给我吗？
 Will you marry me?

1075
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,271
 你不想？ 我不知道
   You won't?   I don't know.

1078

我不知道
 I don't know.

1082
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:15,633
明天回答我好吗？ 我不想逼你太紧
 How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy.

我不知道
 I don't know.

1084
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:20,598
我不知道发生了什么
 I don't know what's happening.

1085
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,304
你很迷惑吗？
 You mean you're confused?

1087
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:31,040
我们就要结婚了
We're getting married.

1090
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:48,524
我要走了

1091

我会考虑清楚的
 I'll think about it.

班杰明 我还没决定要嫁给你呢

1102
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,040
我就是觉得不太可行 为什么？

为什么？ 我就觉得不会

我们明天去体检好吗？

如果你那么想和我结婚 为什么不直接把我掳走呢？
 Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?

1106
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,902
为什么不直接把你掳走？
 Why don't I just drag you off?

1107

好 体检之后我会做的

你想解释一下 为什么你要那样做吗？

没有
 No.

1138
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,278
和你没有关系的 先生
 It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1139
01:31:26,386 --> 01:31:29,378
班 和我绝对是有关系的
Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.

1141

班 我们是受过教育的人
 Ben, I think we're civilized human beings.

1142
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:34,690
你认为有必要这样互相威胁吗？
 Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

1143

01:31:58,385 --> 01:32:01,718
 罗宾森先生...  先等我说完
  Mr. Robinson...   Have the decency to wait until I finish.

罗宾森太太和我之间的事...
 What happened between Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing...

1159
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,630
那并不代表什么
 It didn't mean anything.

1163
01:32:27,414 --> 01:32:29,644
你误解了 我想是了
You miss the point.  I guess I do.

1164
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:32,549
我喜欢的是你女儿 不是你太太
I don't love your wife. I love your daughter.

1165

好了 现在听我说

我不知道我是否可以起诉 但我想是可以的
 I don't know whether I can prosecute, but I think I can.

I've seen Elaine, and I' ve made damn sure you can't get to her.

我不想和你浪费时间
 I don't want to mince words with you.

1172
01:32:54,941 --> 01:32:57,375
你听清楚了吗？
Is that perfectly clear to you?

1173
01:32:57,544 --> 01:33:01,947
我说完了 班 别怪我不和你握手
that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me if I don't shake hands with you.

1174
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,975
我觉得你很无耻
 I think you are filth.

 Could I make one phone call first?

1184
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:40,412
