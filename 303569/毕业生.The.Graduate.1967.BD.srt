 I mean, you didn't really think I'd do something like that.

161

罗宾森太太你想引诱我
 Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,818

没事的喝酒吧
 It's all right. Finish your drink.

180
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,765
罗宾森太太 我那样说你真的很不该
 Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.

181
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,168
很快就会忘记的喝酒吧
 We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.

182
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:24,571

你看过伊琳的肖像画吗？
 Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

伊琳是个很吸引人的女孩 是吗？
 Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she?

190
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,973
我忘记了她的眼睛是棕色的
 I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,379
我没有害怕罗宾森太太
 I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

207
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:42,079
那你为什么要跑？
 Then why do you keep running away?

208
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:44,951
你就要睡觉了我不应该逗留
 Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.

如果那样？
 What if he did?

213
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,626
那样就很有趣了不是吗？
 It would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

214
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,224
你认为他不相信我们吗？
 Don't you think he'd trust us together?

215
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:58,370
他当然相信
 Of course, he does,

216
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,997
但是他也会想到别的 任何人都会
 but he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.

217
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:03,336
我不明白我比你大一倍 他们怎么会想...
 I don't see why. I' m twice as old as you. How could anyone think...

218
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,138
会的你不知道吗？
 They would, don't you see?

那个接待员好象开始怀疑我了
 The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

481
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:43,777
我...我就站在这里？
 Shall I... I mean, should I just stand here?

482
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:46,407
我知道你想我做什么
 I mean, I don't know what you want me to do.

483
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,048
- 为什么不看着呢？ - 噢是的谢谢
 -  Why don't you watch? -  Oh, sure. Thank you.

484

494
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:56,277
班在黑暗里你会好过些 对吗？
 Benjamin, would this be easier for you in the dark?

495
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,388
罗宾森太太我不能这样做
 Mrs. Robinson, I can't do this.

496
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:00,319
- 你什么？- 这样太不应该了
 -  You what? -  This is all terribly wrong.

497
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:03,356
- 你觉得我不吸引你吗？ - 噢不是罗宾森太太
 -  Do you find me undesirable? -  Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson.

498
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:06,226
我觉得你是我父母的朋友中 最吸引人的一个了
 I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends.

499
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:08,560
是真的你很吸引人但我...
 I mean that. I find you desirable, but I...

500
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:11,096
能想象到我父母会怎样吗？
 For god's sake, can you imagine my parents?

501
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,863
如果他们看到 我们在这里会怎么样呢？
 Can you imagine what they'd say if they just saw us here in this room right now?

502
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:16,370
- 他们会说什么？ - 我不知道罗宾森太太
 -  What would they say? -  I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson,

503
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:17,964
但是
 but for god's sake.

504
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:19,837
他们培育我的 给了我很好的生活
 They brought me up. They made a good life for me,

505
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,844
我想他们不应该看到这样
 and I think they deserve better than this.

506
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:24,904
他们不应该发现 自己搭档的妻子在这床上
 I think they deserve a little better than jumping into bed with the partner's wife.

507
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:26,279
你害怕我吗？
 Are you afraid of me?

508
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,817
噢不是你误解了其实...
 Oh, no, you're missing the point. Look...

509
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,444
我们可以一起做些别的事情
 Maybe we could do something else together.

510
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,323
罗宾森太太 我们去看电影好吗？
 Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie?

511
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:39,022
可以问你一个私人问题吗？
 Can I ask you a personal question?

512
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,290
- 问什么都可以 - 这是你的第一次吗？
 -  Ask me anything you want. -  Is this your first time?

513
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:43,362
- 是什么？- 是的对吧？
 -  Is this what? -  It is, isn't it?

514
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,764
这是你的第一次
 It is your first time.

515
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:47,530
这真的很好笑罗宾森太太
 That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh.

516
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:50,372
- 你可以承认的对吗？ - 你在开玩笑吗？
 -  You can admit that, can't you? -  Are you kidding?

517
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,101
没什么要觉得羞愧的
 It's nothing to be ashamed of.

518
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:53,506
- 等一等 - 你的第一次...
 -  Wait a minute. -  On your first time...

519
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:55,306
谁说这是我的第一次？
 Who said it was my first time? Wait a minute.

520
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,471
是因为你很不自然
 Just because you happen to be inadequate.

521
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:58,946
很不自然？
 Inadequate?

522
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:05,154
- 我应该...- 别动！
 -  Well, I guess I better... -  Don't move!

523
00:43:02,852 --> 00:43:04,444
班你在做什么？
 Ben, what are you doing?

524
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:13,657
我只是在池里漂浮
 Well, I would say that I' m just drifting here in the pool

525
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,128
为什么？
 Why?

526
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:18,790
这样漂浮很舒服啊
 Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here.

527
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,304
你想过研究所的事情吗？
 Have you thought about graduate school

528
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:23,634
没有
 No.

529
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:27,470
那你在大学苦读四年 是为了什么？
 Would you mind telling me what those 4 years of college were for?

530
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,842
那些努力是为了什么？
 What was the point of all that hard work?

531
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:31,344
你难到我了
 You got me.

532
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,108
听我说班...
 Now, listen, Ben...

533
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:36,416
其实
 Look.

534
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:39,947
我觉得在付出努力
 I think it's a very good thing that a young man,

535
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:42,491
成为一个年轻有为的人之后
 after he's done some very good work,

536
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:46,250
是应该给自己一个机会
 should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself

537
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:49,128
放松一下
 and lie around and drink beer and so on.

538
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,063
但在几个星期之后
 But after a few weeks,

539
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:56,701
我想那年轻人也应该收拾心情
 I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation

540
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,536
开始做些正经事了
 and start to think about getting off his ass.

541
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,471
罗宾森夫妇来了
 Robinsons are here.

542
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:08,408
你好啊班 这些日子在做什么啊？
 Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?

543
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:10,418
噢没做什么
 Oh, not too much.

544
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,312
放松一下
 Taking it easy.

545
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:16,323
那是我觉得应该做的 没什么不妥
 That's what I' d do if I could. Nothing wrong with that.

546
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:20,125
对了班伊琳很快就要回来了
 Hey, Ben. Elaine's coming down from berkeley soon.

547
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,027
这次你去约她吧
 I want you to call her up this time.

548
00:44:22,132 --> 00:44:23,429
我会的
 I will.

549
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:26,468
我想你们一定很适合对方的
 Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.

550
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:29,769
向罗宾森太太问好啊班
 Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

556
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:00,928
亲爱的 我想问你一些事情但...
 Darling, I' m going to ask you something, but you...

557
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:03,802
如果你不想的话 可以不用回答我的
 You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

558
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:05,434
什么？
 What?

559
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:10,175
我想问你最近晚上 出去外面做什么
 Well, I' m going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.

560
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,007
出去外面？
 When I go off?

561
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:16,079
你不想的话可以不用回答我
 You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

562
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,186
不我会回答你的
 No, I do. I want to tell you.

563
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:21,086
我只是驾车到处逛
 I drive around.

564
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:24,184
- 没其他了？- 没有了
 -  What else? -  Nothing else.

565
00:45:24,994 --> 00:45:27,895
你不会一直开车逛 到下一天早上才回家的班
 You don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.

566
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:29,328
噢不会
 Oh, no.

567
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:30,696
那你做什么？
 Well, then, what do you do?

568
00:45:31,634 --> 00:45:32,965
和某人约会？
 You meet someone?

569
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:34,535
约会？
 Meet someone?

570
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:37,002
- 为什么这样说？ - 那是你的私事
 -  Why do you say that? -  Well, this is your business.

571
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:39,641
- 我不想这样说了- 等等
 -  I won't play games with you. -  Wait, wait.

572
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,940
我没有和别人约会 但你为什么这样问我？
 I don't meet anyone, mother, but why do you say that?

573
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,538
班我不想干扰你的私事
 Benjamin, I don't want to pry into your affairs,

574
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:49,744
但我觉得你说的话很不诚实
 but I would rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest.

575
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,812
- 晚安- 但是...
 -  Good night. -  Well, wait...

576

罗宾森太太 这次我们先说几句再开始好吗？
 Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?

579
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:07,733
我想我们之间没什么好说的
 I don't think we have much to say to each other.

580
00:46:12,742 --> 00:46:16,872
这些月以来我们做的 就只是来这里上床睡觉
 Look, for months, all we've done is come up here and leap into bed together.

581
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:19,039
你厌倦了吗？
 Are you tired of it?

582
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:20,978
不我不是
 I'm not, no.

583
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,483
但你不觉得我们应该 改变一下气氛吗？
 But do you think we could liven it up with a little conversation for a change?

584
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:26,078
你到底想说什么？
 What do you want to talk about?

585
00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:28,282
什么都可以
 Anything. Anything at all.

586
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:31,925
你想说一下 你在大学时的经历吗？
 Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?

587
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,719
噢天啊
 Oh, my god.

588
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:39,728
想别的话题吧
 Think of another topic.

589
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:51,103
艺术怎么样？
 How about art?

590
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:53,606
艺术这是个很好的话题
 Art. That's a good subject.

591
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:55,116
你开头吧
 You start it off.

592
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:57,549
你开头吧我一点也不懂
 You start it off. I don't know anything about it.

593
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:59,548
那你想知道些什么？
 Well, what do you want to know about it?

594
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:02,350
你喜欢现代艺术 还是古典艺术？
 Are you interested more in modern art or in classical art?

595
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:03,854
两个都不喜欢
 Neither.

596
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:05,450
- 你对艺术没有兴趣？- 没有
 -  You're not interested in art? -  No.

597
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:06,893
那你为什么想说艺术？
 Then why do you want to talk about it?

598
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:07,985
我不想的
 I don't.

599
00:47:08,097 --> 00:47:10,657
我们要做的是找些话题 交谈一下
 Now, look, we're going to do this thing. We're going to have a conversation.

600
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:12,800
告诉我你今天做了些什么吧
 Tell me what you did today.

601
00:47:15,104 --> 00:47:16,765
我起床
 I got up.

602
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,298
- 帮我丈夫做早餐- 对了
 -  I fixed breakfast for my husband. -  There.

603
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:23,735
我们可以说一下你丈夫的事情
 There's something we could have a conversation about... your husband.

604
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,480
噢他
 Oh. Him.

605
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:27,312
什么都可以
 I mean, everything.

606
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,941
我不知道你是怎么应付过来的
 I don't know anything about how you work this.

607
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,153
你晚上离开的时候是 怎样和他说的？
 What do you say to him when you leave the house at night?

608
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:33,745
没什么他睡着了
 Nothing. He's asleep.

609
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:35,187
每次都是？
 Always?

610
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:37,017
你回来的时候不会吵醒他？
 Doesn't he wake up when you come home?

611
00:47:39,128 --> 00:47:41,119
我们有不同的卧室
 We have separate bedrooms.

612
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:42,631
噢是这样
 Oh, I see.

613
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:44,795
所以...
 So you don't...

614
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:48,897
我不是想多管闲事 但你们似乎不是一起睡觉的
 I don't like to seem like I' m prying, but I guess you don't sleep together.

615
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:50,738
是的
 No, we don't.

616
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,630
这样有多久了？
 How long has this been going on?

617
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,700
- 好了别说这个了- 等一等
 -  For god's sake, let's drop this. -  Wait a minute.

618
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:56,208
你为什么嫁给他？
 Why did you marry him?

619
00:47:56,879 --> 00:47:58,312
看你能不能猜到了
 See if you can guess.

620
00:47:58,748 --> 00:48:00,010
我猜不到
 Well, I can't.

621
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,318
认真想想吧班
 Think real hard, Benjamin.

622
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:04,648
我不知道为什么除非...
 I can't see why you did, unless...

623
00:48:05,688 --> 00:48:07,883
你是不得以才嫁给他的对吗？
 You didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?

624
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:17,933
不要告诉伊琳
 Don't tell Elaine.

625
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:20,996
噢你嫁给他是因为你怀孕了
 Oh, no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant.

626
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:22,868
你很震惊吗？
 Are you shocked?

627
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:27,574
我从来没想到罗宾森先生 和你是那种...
 I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

628
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,272
好了我们睡觉吧
 All right now, let's get to bed.

629
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,076
等等
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

630
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,641
那是怎样发生的？
 So how did it happen?

631
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,543
- 什么？- 你和罗宾森先生
 -  What? -  You and Mr. Robinson.

632
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:40,212
你想告诉我当时的情况吗？
 Do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?

633
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:42,552
不是特别想
 Not particularly.

634
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,925
- 他那时是读法律的吗？ - 是的
 -  Was he a law student at the time? -  Mm- hmm.

635
00:48:46,496 --> 00:48:49,056
- 你那时也是学生吗？- 是的
 -  And you were a student also? -  Mm- hmm.

636
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,765
在大学？
 At college?

637
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,791
是的
 Yes.

638
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:55,699
你主修什么？
 What was your major?

639
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:03,002
班为什么你要问这些问题？
 Benjamin, why are you asking me all these questions?

640
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:05,410
因为我想知道啊罗宾森太太
 Because I' m interested, Mrs. Robinson.

641
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:07,812
你读大学时主修什么？
 What was your major subject at college?

642
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,116
- 艺术- 艺术？
 -  Art. -  Art?

643
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:16,121
我还以为你...
 But I thought you...

644
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:24,759
我看这些年来 你已经对它失去兴趣了吧
 I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years, then.

645
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:27,733
应该是吧
 Kind of.

646
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,572
那是怎样发生的？
 Well, how did it happen?

647
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:35,007
- 什么？- 你和罗宾森先生
 -  What? -  You and Mr. Robinson.

648
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:37,144
你认为呢？
 How do you think?

649
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:39,271
你带他来这个房间的吗？
 Did you take you up to his room with him?

650
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:40,679
你们去酒店的吗？
 Did you go to a hotel

651
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,047
噢班那有什么重要的吗？
 Oh, Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?

652
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:44,380
我很好奇
 I'm curious.

653
00:49:44,954 --> 00:49:47,752
- 我们上了他的车- 噢不
 -  We'd go to his car. -  Oh, no.

654
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:49,690
你们在车上做的？
 In the car you did it?

655
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,717
我想我们不是第一个这样的
 Well, I don't think we were the first.

656
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:53,626
那是什么车？
 What kind of car was it?

657
00:49:55,765 --> 00:49:56,925
什么？
 What?

658
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,162
还记得那是什么车吗？
 Do you remember the make of the car?

659
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:02,427
- 噢天啊- 我真的想知道
 -  Oh, my god. -  Really, I want to know.

660
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:04,540
是福特班
 It was a ford, Benjamin.

661
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:06,074
福特
 A ford.

662
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:10,712
福特该死的很不错啊
 A ford. God damn it, that's great. A ford.

663
00:50:11,581 --> 00:50:13,139
够了
 That's enough.

664
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,085
那伊琳就是在一辆 福特里开始的咯
 So old Elaine Robinson got started in a ford.

665
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:23,121
不要说伊琳
 Don't talk about Elaine.

666
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:24,818
不要说伊琳？
 Don't talk about Elaine?

667
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:26,488
是的
 No.

668
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:28,654
为什么？
 Why not?

669
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:30,690
因为我不想你说她
 Because I don't want you to.

670
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,333
为什么呢？
 Well, why don't you?

671
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,193
我想你来告诉我
 I wish you'd tell me.

672
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:35,827
没什么好说的
 There's nothing to tell.

673
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:38,596
为什么一说起她 就紧张起来呢？
 Well, why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

674
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:44,213
看来我要约伊琳出来问清楚咯
 Well, I guess I' II have to ask her out on a date and find out what the big deal is.

675
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:48,115
班你不许和她约会
 Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

676
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:49,650
明白了吗？
 Do you understand that?

677
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:51,844
我无意约她出来的
 I have no intention of taking her out.

678
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,123
好
 Good.

679
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:58,723
我只是开个玩笑
 I was just kidding around.

680
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:02,931
好
 Good.

681
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,564
为什么？
 Well, why shouldn't I

682
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:12,037
- 我有我的原因 - 那就说出来吧
 -  I have my reasons. -  Then let's hear them.

683
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,199
不行
 No.

684
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:15,938
说出来吧我知道是为什么
 Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson, because I think I know what they are.

685
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:18,811
我配不上和她有联系？
 I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I

686
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:21,245
我也配不上说起她对吗？
 I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I

687
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:23,352
- 不要再说了- 不说不行
 -  Let's drop it. -  We're not dropping it.

688
00:51:23,386 --> 00:51:26,150
我配得上你 但配不起和你女儿有联系
 I'm good enough for you, but I' m not good enough to associate with your daughter.

689
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:27,847
- 就是这样是吗？- 班
 -  That's it, isn't it? -  Benjamin.

690
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,424
是吗？
 Isn't it?

691
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:43,368
是的
 Yes.

692
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:47,265
你真的很可恶罗宾森太太
 You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

693
00:51:47,476 --> 00:51:48,966
你以为我引以为荣吗？
 Do you think I' m proud of myself?

694
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,636
- 你以为我为这种事骄傲吗？ - 我不知道
 -  Do you think I' m proud of this? -  I wouldn't know.

695
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:52,237
我不是的
 Well, I am not.

696
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:53,914
我也不是
 No, sir.

697
00:51:54,216 --> 00:51:57,481
我不该浪费自己的青春 在一个心碎了的酒鬼身上
 I'm not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic.

698
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,584
我明白了
 I see.

699
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:03,386
如果你以为我是因为寂寞 才来找你就大错特错了
 If you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom than you're all wrong.

700
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:05,253
那是因为罗宾森太太
 'Cause, Mrs. Robinson,

701
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:08,088
这是我做过的 最令自己恶心的事情
 this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

702
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:10,788
你做到了你想做的事 但我却在受罪
 You do what you want, but I' m getting the hell out.

703
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,662
是吗？
 Are you?

704
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:13,929
当然是了
 Goddamn right, I am.

705
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:20,437
你是这样看我的吗？ 我是那么令你讨厌的吗？
 That's how you feel about me? That I' m a sick and disgusting person?

706
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:22,841
- 别开始- 什么？
 -  Now, don't start this. -  What?

707
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:24,943
别开始扮作伤心
 Don't start acting hurt.

708
00:52:25,114 --> 00:52:27,139
你不希望我会有一点伤心吗？
 Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

709
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:30,912
你说的对我配不上你女儿
 Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.

710
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,511
我有那样说吗？
 Did I say that?

711
00:52:32,822 --> 00:52:34,414
你的意思是这样
 In so many words.

712
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:39,820
班很抱歉我给你留下 那么差的印象
 Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.

713
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,864
两分钟前你还说 我配不上你女儿
 Well, 2 minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

714
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:45,366
现在你又给我道歉
 Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.

715
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:47,095
我无意的
 I didn't mean it.

716
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:49,431
我认为你们是合不来的
 I don't think you'd be right for each other.

717
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:53,165
但我不认为你比不上她
 I'd never say you aren't as good a person as she is.

718
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:55,601
真的？
 You wouldn't?

719
00:52:56,746 --> 00:52:58,509
当然是了
 Of course I wouldn't.

720
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:04,475
你在做什么？
 What are you doing?

721
00:53:04,587 --> 00:53:08,114
很明显你不希望我再烦着你了
 Well, it's pretty obvious you don't want me around anymore.

722
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:12,090
其实...
 Well, look, uh...

723
00:53:14,764 --> 00:53:16,698
刚才我有点不知所措
 I was kind of upset there.

724
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,100
我为我说的话道歉
 I'm sorry I said those things.

725
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,103
没关系
 It's all right.

726
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:25,104
我知道自己为什么如此让你讨厌
 I think I can understand why I' m disgusting to you.

727
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:27,373
噢不
 Oh, no.

728
00:53:29,078 --> 00:53:32,809
我喜欢你的不然我不会来这里
 Look, I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

729
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:35,507
那不是令你很难受的吗？
 But if it's sickening for you?

730
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:37,016
不是
 It's not.

731
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:44,023
我很享受也很盼望 那是我唯一想去做的
 I enjoy it. I look forward to it. It 's the one thing I have to look forward to.

732
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,960
你不必这样说
 You don't have to say that.

733
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:49,724
我不应该...
 Well, I wouldn't.

734
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:52,163
我不应该说那些话的
 I would never say it if it wasn't true.

735
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:54,393
那我可以留下来吗？
 May I stay, then?

736
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:59,201
可以我想你留下来
 Yes, please. I want you to.

737
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,039
- 谢谢- 不必谢我
 -  Thank you. -  Well, don't.

738
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:05,036
是我想你这样做的
 Thank me, because I want you to.

739
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:08,943
你能答应我不和伊琳约会吗？
 But you won't ever take Elaine out, will you?

740
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:10,713
我想你作出承诺
 I want you to promise me that.

741
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:13,344
为什么要这样呢？
 Look, why the hell did you bring this up?

742
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,980
我不会和她约会的
 It never occurred to me to take her out.

743
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:16,649
那就保证你不会吧！
 Then give me your word you won't!

744
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:19,422
真有点荒唐
 This is absurd.

745
00:54:20,062 --> 00:54:21,723
答应我班
 Promise me, Benjamin.

746
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:24,359
好了我答应
 All right, I promise.

747
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:27,630
我答应你不和 伊琳.罗宾森约会
 For christ's sake, I promise I'll never take out Elaine Robinson.

748
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,529
谢谢
 Thank you.

749
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,740
- 班...- 我们不要再说了
 -  Benjamin... -  Let's not talk about it.

750
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,146
不要再说了
 Let's not talk at all.

751
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:20,885
伊琳很快就回来了
 Elaine's back home soon.

752
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,918
我想应该是你 和她约会的好时机了
 I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out.

753
00:55:38,207 --> 00:55:40,402
你觉得她不符合你的要求吗？
 I suppose she's not good enough for you, is that it?

754
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:42,943
伊琳和我是合不来的
 Look, Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.

755
00:55:43,012 --> 00:55:45,242
你怎么知道？ 你们从高中开始就没见面了
 How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school

756
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:47,574
你晚上去做的事
 I suppose your evenings,

757
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,380
不会比和女孩子 交往更加有价值吧
 whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.

758
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:52,284
这些和那些没有关系
 That has nothing to do with it.

759
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:54,379
我应该告诉罗宾森先生...
 I guess I' II just have to tell Mr. Robinson...

760
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:58,222
你每天晚上都不知道 在做些什么
 that you're too busy every evening doing god knows what.

761
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,091
别这样说了
 Now don't go on like this.

762
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,856
如果班实在不愿约她出去...
 If Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out...

763
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:04,957
没错
 I do.

764
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:10,097
那我只能约他们 全家到我们家咯
 Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinsons over on Thursday.

765
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,343
好了应该四处走走了
 Well, Braddock, it's about time you got around to this.

766
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:28,481
Your wife predicted you would say what?

767
00:56:36,365 --> 00:56:37,957
No points. Right?

768
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:40,364
Here's the next question. Gentlemen...

769
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:41,561
你好
 Hello.

770
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:43,797
What is your wife's most unusual habit?

771
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,372
进来吧班
 Ben, come on in.

772
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:49,138
我想那大小姐还没准备好呢
 I'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet.

773
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:52,008
你会怎样回答？
 What would you say to a short one?

774
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,706
- 还是喝威士忌吗？ - 波旁酒
 -  Scotch still your drink? -  Bourbon.

775
00:56:55,284 --> 00:56:57,081
Can you think of something that bothers you?

776
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:01,684
Not shaving her legs.

777
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,926
我去看看她
 Well, I' II see if she's ready.

778
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:27,107
我不想这样的 是我父亲的想法
 Listen, this was not my idea. This was my father's idea.

779
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:30,343
班我想我已经讲得很清楚的了
 Benjamin, I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.

780
00:57:30,419 --> 00:57:33,547
我们就出去坐一下 然后我就把她送回来
 Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink, and I' II bring her right back.

781
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:36,614
不然我们两家人 就要一起吃晚餐了
 Because it was either that or a dinner party for the 2 families.

782
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:39,558
我想我应付不了那样
 And I' m afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind.

783
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:44,758
我不会再约你的女儿出去的
 Look, I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again,

784
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:47,165
- 不要那么担心- 我就是...
 -  so don't get upset about it. -  I am.

785
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,671
非常担心啊班
 I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.

786
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:53,671
你好
 Hello.

787
00:57:54,143 --> 00:57:55,542
你好
 Hello.

788
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:58,078
希望你们今天晚上玩得开心吧
 I want you to keep your wits about you tonight.

789
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,972
你要小心班哦他很狡猾的
 You never know what tricks Ben picked up back there in the east.

790
00:58:13,462 --> 00:58:15,487
你现在住在家里吗？
 You're living at home now, is that right?

791
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:16,859
是的
 Yes.

792
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,857
你有计划将来做什么吗？
 Do you know what you're going to do?

793
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:21,233
没有
 No.

794
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:26,432
你想读研究生吗？
 Are you going to graduate school

795
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:28,102
不
 No.

796
00:58:33,983 --> 00:58:36,110
你总是这样驾车的吗？
 Do you always drive like this?

797
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:37,344
是的
 Yes.

798
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,867
请坐
 Sit down.

799
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:20,021
你为什么不看表演？
 Why don't you watch the show?

800
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:26,718
班你是不是讨厌我？
 Benjamin, do you dislike me for some reason?

801
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:29,054
不我怎么会呢？
 No. Why should I

802
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:31,763
我不知道
 I don't know.

803
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:42,707
你错过最精彩的部分了
 You're missing a great effect here.

804
01:00:45,747 --> 01:00:47,476
你觉得怎样？
 How do you like that?

805
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:52,348
你可以那样做吗？
 Could you do it?

806
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:57,455
去啊宝贝！
 Go, baby, go!

807
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:16,944
- 停啊！- 喂！
 -  Stop! -  Hey!

808
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:27,755
伊琳对不起
 Elaine, I' m sorry.

809
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:30,047
伊琳
 Elaine.

810
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,323
送我回家好吗？
 Would you take me home now?

811
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:34,623
我不该把你带到这里
 I'm sorry I took you in there.

812
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:36,459
我应该回家了
 I think I better go home, please.

813
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:43,269
伊琳
 Elaine.

814
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:44,772
车在哪里？
 Where's the car?

815
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:46,467
我想和你说一些话
 I just want to tell you something.

816
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:51,846
我要回家
 I want to go home.

817
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,871
就听我说一件事好吗？
 But, I just tell you this one thing?

818
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:55,975
什么？
 What?

819
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:58,678
其实... 这次约会只是我父母的主意
 This whole idea... this date and everything, it was my parents' idea.

820
01:01:58,787 --> 01:02:00,220
他们逼我这样做的
 They forced me into it.

821
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:02,755
很感谢你告诉我
 That's very nice of you to tell me.

822
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:05,319
不我的意思是 刚才是我刻意做出来的
 No, what I mean is, that's why I' ve been acting this way.

823
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:07,793
我不是那样的人 我讨厌那样做
 I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

824
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,330
请你不要再哭了好吗？
 Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

825
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:16,028
我忍不住
 No, I couldn't.

826
01:02:16,104 --> 01:02:17,867
- 你试一下好吗？ - 不行啊
 -  Well, could you try? -  No.

827
01:02:32,321 --> 01:02:34,789
自从我毕业以后...
 I've had his feeling ever since I' ve graduated...

828
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:37,617
我经常有那种冲动 觉得很烦躁
 This kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time,

829
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:39,023
你明白我的意思吗？
 You know what I mean?

830
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,154
明白
 Yes, I do.

831
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:46,032
我觉得就像在玩一种游戏
 It's like I was playing some kind of game,

832
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:48,093
但规则对我来说毫无意义
 but the rules don't make any sense to me.

833
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:50,632
都是某些人错误地制造出来的
 They're being made up by all the wrong people.

834
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:52,134
不
 No.

835
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:55,704
我觉得不是他们去玩游戏 而是他们被游戏玩弄
 I mean, no one makes them up. They seem to make themselves up.

836
01:02:57,679 --> 01:02:58,941
喂！
 Say!

837
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:01,743
能把音量调小一点吗？
 Could I request that you turn that down?

838
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:54,693
你想进屋里吗？
 Would you like to come in?

839
01:03:55,704 --> 01:03:57,296
我请你喝杯咖啡
 I could make you some coffee.

840
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,808
不了我不想打扰其他人
 No. I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.

841
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,109
不会的
 We won't.

842
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:04,802
我们进去吧
 Let's go inside.

843
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:06,612
等等
 Wait a minute.

844
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:08,206
怎么了？
 Is anything wrong?

845
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:11,451
没什么我在想...
 No. I was just thinking.

846
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,644
现在还早着呢
 It's still early.

847
01:04:14,022 --> 01:04:16,217
我们还可以去别的地方玩
 Maybe we could do something, go somewhere else.

848
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:19,491
好啊
 All right.

849
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:28,259
我们去哪里？
 Where are we going?

850
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:31,401
我在想附近有什么地方 可以喝酒的
 I'm trying to think of... where there's a place to have a drink around here.

851
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:33,566
不是有一间泰福酒店吗？
 Isn't there one at the taft hotel

852
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:36,977
怎么了？
 What is the matter?

853
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:40,105
没什么 我不知道那里有没有酒吧
 Nothing. I' m just wondering if they have a bar or not.

854
01:04:40,282 --> 01:04:42,011
我们去看看吧
 I mean, let's go see.

855
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:43,608
看看那里有没有
 Let's go see if they do or not.

856
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:48,178
伊琳据我所知
 Listen, Elaine, it seems to me that there isn't a bar here.

857
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:49,416
这里似乎没有酒吧哦
 I mean, as far as I know.

858
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:51,721
当然有了就在那里
 Of course there is. Look, there's the palm room right there.

859
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,152
晚安
 Good evening.

860
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:55,020
- 你好- 你好先生

我们走吧伊琳 去其他地方
 Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.

866

- 他们认识你吗？ - 当然不认识了

- 晚上好先生 - 伊琳我们走吧

869
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:19,688
- 班到底怎么了？ - 我不知道
 -  Benjamin, what's happening? -  I don't know.

870
01:05:19,688 --> 01:05:21,815
他们把我当成 是什么格莱斯登先生了
 They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

871
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,619
你好布迪夫先生
 Hello, Mr. Braniff.

872
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:39,740
伊琳我很喜欢你
 Elaine, I like you. Ilike you so much.

873
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,740
你相信我吗？
 Do you believe that?

874
01:05:46,248 --> 01:05:48,614
- 是吗？- 是的
 -  Do you? -  Yes.

875
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:51,882
你是第一个...
 You're the first...

876
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:56,715
我觉得你是第一个...
 You're the first thing for so long that I' ve liked,

877
01:05:57,526 --> 01:05:59,756
我想一起生活的人
 the first person I could stand to be with.

878
01:06:02,431 --> 01:06:05,332
我的一生就那么浪费了
 My whole life is such a waste.

879
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:07,995
徒劳无功
 It's just nothing.

880
01:06:12,741 --> 01:06:15,369
不好意思我现在送你回家
 I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

881
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:21,447
班你是不是因为 某个人而烦恼？
 Benjamin, are you having an affair with someone?

882
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,279
对不起
 I'm sorry.

883
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:31,616
对不起那是你的私事
 I'm sorry. That's not my business.

884
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:34,224
已经发生了
 It just happened.

885
01:06:36,364 --> 01:06:39,993
就像其他事情那样发生了
 It's just this thing that happened along with everything else.

886
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:43,034
你明白吗？
 Can you understand that?

887
01:06:44,573 --> 01:06:46,404
她结了婚？
 Was she married or something?

888
01:06:47,976 --> 01:06:49,534
是的
 Yes.

889
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:51,839

892
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,349
说完了吗？
 And it's all over now?

893
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:08,353
是的
 Yes.

894
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:16,532
我很开心
 I'm glad.

895
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:28,879
我们明天去做别的好吗？

老实说她不喜欢我的
 She doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.

963
01:16:44,472 --> 01:16:46,702
- 你是学生？- 不算是

1028
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:05,689

我们去你房间看你的肖像画... - 不要！
 -  We went upstairs to see your portrait... -  No! I don't!

01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:46,056
尖叫就肯定有事
 Screaming is not all right, not in my house, It isn't.

1040
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:48,633
只是我的一个客人 现在没事了
 It was just a visitor, but it's all right now.

1041
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:52,103
你对她做了些什么？
 What did you do to her?

1042
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:55,433
她只是很压抑所以叫了一声 现在好了
 Look, she's all right. She's upset, and she screamed, but it's ok now.

1043
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:57,033
- 要叫警察来吗？- 什么？
 -  Shall I get the cops? -  What?

1044
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:58,873
- 我去报警- 喂等一等
 -  I' II get the cops. -  Hey, wait a minute.

1045
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,508
可恶听我说
 Now, damn it, look.

1046
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:03,043
她就在这里喝着水
 Here she is, having some water.

1047
01:23:04,452 --> 01:23:06,443
没必要叫警察来
 There's no need for the cops or anything.

1048
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:09,452
好了大家回去吧
 All right, boys, you can all go back to your rooms now.

1049
01:23:09,957 --> 01:23:11,185
去吧
 Go ahead.

1050
01:23:11,759 --> 01:23:13,852
我不想再发生这种事
 We won't have any more of this agitation.

1051
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:17,697
- 明白了吗布先生？- 好的
 -  Will we, Braddock? -  No, sir.

1052
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:22,459
我要你搬走
 I want you out of here.

1053
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,263
- 什么意思？- 我要你搬走
 -  What do you mean? -  You heard me out of here.

1054
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,602
- 为什么？- 因为我不喜欢你
 -  What for? -  Because I don't like you.

1055
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:02,269
刚才的事很抱歉
 I'm sorry I screamed.

1056
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:09,012
班你来这里之前
 Benjamin, when you came up here,

1057
01:24:09,116 --> 01:24:11,243
有想过我们之间 会发生什么事吗？
 what did you think was going to happen between us?

1058
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,688
伊琳我现在不想说什么
 Elaine, right now I don't feel like talking much.

1059
01:24:15,756 --> 01:24:18,884
我为我所做的一切道歉 现在我只能离开这里了
 I'm sorry about everything, but I think I' II just do this now.

1060
01:24:30,771 --> 01:24:32,898
我可以在这看你收拾行李吗？
 Can I just sit here while you're packing?

1061
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:50,016
你有什么打算？
 What are you going to do now?

1062
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:52,748
我不知道
 I don't know.

1063
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,792
- 你会回家吗？- 不
 -  Are you going home? -  No.

1064
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:57,827
那你要去哪里？
 Well, where are you going?

1065
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,963
伊琳请你不要再问了
 Elaine, you're going to have to stop asking me that.

1066
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,015
我不想你马上就走
 I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

1067
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:23,680
我不明白
 I don't understand.

1068
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:25,752
在你有明确的方向之前...
 I don't want you to go anywhere...

1069
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,759
我不想你离开这里
 Until you have a definite plan.

1070
01:25:31,532 --> 01:25:33,227
再见
 Good- bye.

1071
01:26:08,969 --> 01:26:10,561
怎么了？
 What's happening?

1072
01:26:10,771 --> 01:26:12,466
- 班？- 什么？
 -  Benjamin? -  What?

1073
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:19,935
亲我一下好吗？
 Will you kiss me?

1074
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,267
你愿意嫁给我吗？
 Will you marry me?

1075
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,271
- 你不想？- 我不知道
 -  You won't? -  I don't know.

1076
01:26:58,285 --> 01:26:59,946
有可能吗？
 But you might?

1077
01:27:01,088 --> 01:27:02,612
有的
 I might.

1078
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:04,481
是吗？
 Is that so?

1079
01:27:05,092 --> 01:27:07,526
- 你可能会嫁给我？- 是的
 -  You might marry me? -  Yes.

1080
01:27:08,696 --> 01:27:10,186
什么时候？
 When?

1081
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:12,958
我不知道
 I don't know.

1082
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:15,633
明天回答我好吗？ 我不想逼你太紧
 How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy.

1083
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,465
我不知道
 I don't know.

1084
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:20,598
我不知道发生了什么
 I don't know what's happening.

1085
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,304
你很迷惑吗？
 You mean you're confused?

1086
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:28,675
不要这样
 Look, don't be confused.

1087
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:31,040
我们就要结婚了
 We're getting married.

1088
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,344
我不知道怎么可以
 I don't see how we can.

1089
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:39,517
一定可以的
 We just can.

1090
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:48,524
我要走了
 I have to go now.

1091
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,268
伊琳？
 Hey, Elaine?

1092
01:27:52,973 --> 01:27:54,668
你是认真的吗？
 Are you serious about this?

1093
01:27:56,043 --> 01:27:57,442
我会考虑清楚的
 I'll think about it.

1094
01:27:57,878 --> 01:27:59,937
- 真的吗？- 是的
 -  You really will? -  Yes.

1095
01:28:13,093 --> 01:28:14,583
太好了
 Good god.

1096
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:18,758
我们明天可以去体检了
 We can go get our blood tests tomorrow.

1097
01:28:18,799 --> 01:28:20,323
- 明天？- 今天下午也行
 -  Tomorrow? -  Or this afternoon.

1098
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:21,561
今天很好啊
 It's a good day for it.

1099
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:24,071
班我还没决定要嫁给你呢
 Benjamin, I haven't even said I' II marry you yet.

1100
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:25,470
要我们的出生证明的
 We'll need our birth certificates.

1101
01:28:25,572 --> 01:28:28,370
我刚好带在身上你的呢？
 I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?

1102
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,040
- 我觉得不太可行- 为什么？
 -  I just don't think it would work. -  Why wouldn't it?

1103
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,025
- 为什么？- 我就觉得不会
 -  Why wouldn't it? -  I just don't think it would.

1104
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:50,657
那我们明天再去体检好吗？
 Tomorrow, then. Can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning?

1105
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:54,895
如果你那么想和我结婚 为什么不直接把我掳走呢？
 Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?

1106
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,902
为什么不直接把你掳走？
 Why don't I just drag you off?

1107
01:28:57,004 --> 01:29:00,167
好体检之后我会做的
 All right. I will, right after we get the blood tests.

1108
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,406
我要先见卡尔
 I have to see Carl first.

1109
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:04,238
卡尔是谁？
 Carl who?

1110
01:29:07,414 --> 01:29:09,211
卡尔是谁？
 Carl who?

1111
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:12,779
卡尔.史密斯读医学的 我们认识很久了
 Carl smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

1112
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,945
- 在动物园的那个？- 是的
 -  Who, that guy at the zoo? -  Yes.

1113
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:18,014
- 为什么你要见他？ - 我说过可能会和他结婚的
 -  Why do you have to see him? -  Well, I said I might marry him.

1114
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,484
什么？！
 You what?!

1115
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,490
他是怎么做的？
 How did he do it?

1116
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,222
有跪在地上吗？
 Did he get down on his knees?

1117
01:29:25,332 --> 01:29:27,232
我想他没有那样吧
 He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

1118
01:29:27,267 --> 01:29:28,825
没有
 No, Benjamin.

1119
01:29:28,936 --> 01:29:31,029
他说了什么？我很好奇
 What did he say? I'm curious.

1120
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:32,537
嘘
 Shh.

1121
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:35,938
他说我和他会组织一个 好家庭的
 He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

1122
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:39,237
- 噢他这样说了？- 嘘！
 -  Oh, no. He said that? -  Shh!

1123
01:29:39,346 --> 01:29:40,904
他在哪里说的？
 Where did he do it?

1124
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,778
我想知道在哪里
 I'd like to know where it happened.

1125
01:29:47,654 --> 01:29:49,679
不会在他的车上吧？
 It wasn't in his car, was it?

1126
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,469
晚安
 Good night.

1127
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:06,971
我们明天可以结婚吗？
 Are we getting married tomorrow?

1128
01:30:07,608 --> 01:30:08,973
不
 No.

1129
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:11,635
后天呢？
 The day after tomorrow?

1130
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:16,746
不知道也许可以 也许不可以
 I don't know. Maybe we are, and maybe we're not.

1131
01:31:07,234 --> 01:31:10,567
你想解释一下 为什么你要那样做吗？
 Do you want to, uh... do you want to try and tell me why you did it?

1132
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:13,838
罗宾森先生
 Mr. Robinson.

1133
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,872
你有什么特别憎恨我的吗？
 Do you have a special grudge against me?

1134
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:18,274
你有什么想报复我的吗？
 Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?

1135
01:31:18,345 --> 01:31:19,437
没有
 No.

1136
01:31:19,546 --> 01:31:21,673
是不是因为我说过的某些话
 Is there something I' ve said that's caused this contempt,

1137
01:31:21,748 --> 01:31:24,512
或者是你鄙视我什么吗？
 or is it just things I stand for that you despise?

1138
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:26,278
和你没有关系的先生
 It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1139
01:31:26,386 --> 01:31:29,378
班那和我绝对是有关系的
 Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.

1140
01:31:29,456 --> 01:31:30,946
请你...
 Now, look, please...

1141
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:32,753
班我们都是受过教育的人
 Ben, I think we're 2 civilized human beings.

1142
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:34,690
有必要这样互相威胁吗？
 Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

1143
01:31:34,761 --> 01:31:36,251
我不是在威胁你
 I'm not threatening you.

1144
01:31:36,363 --> 01:31:39,059
你想动手吗？那好啊
 Do you want to unclench your fist, please? Thank you.

1145
01:31:39,266 --> 01:31:41,791
我在暗处看你看得很清楚的
 I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.

1146
01:31:42,102 --> 01:31:45,663
我想说我对你没有任何的成见
 I'm trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1147
01:31:45,772 --> 01:31:47,706
我不是想报复你
 I'm trying to tell you I do not resent you.

1148
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:50,299
你一点也不尊重我
 You don't respect me terribly much, either.

1149
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:52,769
- 不是的- 什么？
 -  No, sir. -  What?

1150
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,574
- 不是 - 不要对我大喊班
 -  No, sir. -  Don't shout at me, Ben.

1151
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:58,344
我没你那么年轻 但我的听觉还是很好的
 I may not be as young as you, but I still have pretty good hearing.

1152
01:31:58,385 --> 01:32:01,718
- 罗宾森先生... - 先等我说完
 -  Mr. Robinson... -  Have the decency to wait until I finish.

1153
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:05,550
我想你很清楚后果 会是怎样的
 I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done.

1154
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:09,093
我想你知道我和我妻子 很快就要离婚的
 I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

1155
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:10,963
为什么？
 But why?

1156
01:32:10,998 --> 01:32:12,431
为什么？！
 Why?!

1157
01:32:12,532 --> 01:32:14,056
听我说
 Listen to me.

1158
01:32:14,835 --> 01:32:17,861
罗宾森太太和我之间的事...
 What happened between Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing.

1159
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,630
并不代表什么
 It didn't mean anything.

1160
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:23,232
我们就像是在握手
 We might just as well have been shaking hands.

1161
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:24,968
在握手
 Shaking hands.

1162
01:32:25,112 --> 01:32:27,376
不是这样说我老婆吧？
 That's not saying much for my wife, is it?

1163
01:32:27,414 --> 01:32:29,644
- 你误解了- 我想是了
 -  You miss the point. -  I guess I do.

1164
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:32,549
我喜欢的是你女儿 不是你太太
 The point is, I don't love your wife. Ilove your daughter, sir.

1165
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:35,521
好了听我说
 All right. Now listen to this.

1166
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:38,623
我不知道是否可以起诉 但我想是可以的
 I don't know whether I can prosecute, but I think I can.

1167
01:32:38,759 --> 01:32:42,525
如果你再烦我女儿 我可以令你坐牢的
 I think I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again.

1168
01:32:42,963 --> 01:32:45,932
我见过伊琳了 我可以肯定你不会得到她
 I've seen Elaine, and I' ve made damn sure you can't get to her.

1169
01:32:46,033 --> 01:32:47,500
别碰我班！
 Stay away from me, Ben!

1170
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:50,498
我不想和你浪费时间
 I don't want to mince words with you.

1171
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:54,836
要想见到伊琳 她现在已经在50里外的地方了
 As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1172
01:32:54,941 --> 01:32:57,375
你听清楚了吗？
 Is that perfectly clear to you?

1173
01:32:57,544 --> 01:33:01,947
我说完了班 别怪我不和你握手
 And that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me if I don't shake hands with you.

1174
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,975
我觉得你很无耻
 I think you are filth.

1175
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:08,484
你很下流！
 I think you are scum!

1176
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:11,852
你是个废物！
 You are a degenerate!

1177
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:19,126
你好
 Hi.

1178
01:33:21,468 --> 01:33:24,460
房东你有硬币吗？ 我要打个电话
 Mr. Mccleery, do you have some change? I need to use the phone.

1179
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:26,671
我要你马上离开这里
 I want you out of here.

1180
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:30,274
我用10块和你换一个硬币 20也行
 Look, I' II give you $10 for a dime. I'll give you 20.

1181
01:33:31,078 --> 01:33:33,410
求你给我打个电话好吗？
 For god's sake, will you let me use that phone?

1182
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:36,511
我现在就去报警
 I'm going to call the police... now.

1183
