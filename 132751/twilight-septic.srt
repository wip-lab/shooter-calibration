1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,747
我从未认真想过我会如何死去 
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.

2
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,174
但是为我爱的人而死似乎是个不错的选择
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.

4
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,592
所以我并不后悔当初离开家的决定 
So, I can't bring myself to regret the decision to leave home.

7
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:29,547
我会想念我挚爱的那个粗心大意、稳定性奇差的母亲和她的新丈夫
I would miss my loving, erratic, harebrained mother and her new husband.

12
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,811
这应该是件好事 我是这么想的 
this will be a good thing,I think.

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,219
人口数只有 3,120人 
Population: 3120 people.

21
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:26,973
那正是我要搬去的地方 
This is where I'm moving

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,171
我的父亲是查理 
My dad's Charlie.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,805
他是这里的警长 
He's the Chief of Police.

24
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,539
你的头发变长了 
Your hair's longer.

25
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:50,617
上次见你之后我剪过了 
I cut since last time I saw you.

26
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,849
我猜它大概长得挺快的吧 
I guess it grew a lot again.

27
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,991
每年夏天，我都会来这里住两个礼拜左右 
I used to spend two weeks here almost every summer,

28
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,581
但那已经是多年前的事了...
But it's been years...

29
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,205
我把浴室的架子清理干净了 
I cleared some shelves up in the bathroom.

30
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,071
哦，好的 
Oh, right

31
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,037
一间浴室 
One bathroom.

32
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,411
蛮实用的工作台灯 
It's a pretty good work lamp.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
席尔斯的销售小姐帮我选的床组 
The Sears lady picked up the bed stuff.

34
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,866
你喜欢紫色，对吧？ 
You like purple, right?

35
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,824
紫色很正点 
Purple's cool.

36
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,785
谢谢 
Thanks.

37
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,353
好了 
Okay.

38
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,965
查理最大的优点之一就是... 
One of the best things about Charlie...

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,341
他不会啰嗦 
He doesn't hover.

40
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,193
我听说你们一路赶过来 
I heard you guys coming all the way down the road.

41
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,700
很高兴见到你 
Good to see you.

42
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,329
贝拉，你还记得比利．布雷克吗？ 
Bella, you remember Billy Black?

43
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,042
记得 
Yeah.

44
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,001
你气色看来不错 
You're looking good.

45
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,870
我还有持续在练舞呢 
I'm still dancing.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,543
我很高兴你终于来了 
I'm glad you are finally here.

47
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:29,286
听说你要来，查理就一直说个不停 
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,296
好啦，少在那夸张了，小心我拖你去喂泥巴 
Alright, keep exaggerating,I'll roll you into the mud

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,700
你敢我就辗你的脚丫子 
Until I ram you in the ankles.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,660
好，来啊！ 
Yeah, bring it!

51
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:39,958
嗨，我是雅各布 
Hi, I'm Jacob.

52
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:43,900
我们小时候经常一起玩泥巴作成派 
We used to make mud pies when we were little.

53
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,384
对，我还记得 
Right, I remember.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,091
他们经常这样闹吗？ 
Are they always like this?

55
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,155
越老越严重 
It's getting worse with old age.

56
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,604
所以，你觉得如何？ 
So, what do you think?

57
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:55,951
什么？ 
What?

58
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,188
你回家的礼物 
Your homecoming present.

59
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,062
这个吗？ 
This?

60
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:01,700
刚向比利买来的 
Just bought it off Billy.

61
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,690
没错 
Yep.

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,120
我帮你重新整修了引擎 
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.

63
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,446
喔，老天 
Oh God

64
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,243
不会吧，哦，我的天啊！ 
Come on.Oh My Gosh!

65
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,080
这真是太棒了！ 
This is perfect!

66
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,065
这不是开玩笑吧 ! 
You must be joking!

67
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:11,811
抱歉 
Sorry.

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,490
我就说她会喜欢的 
I told you she'd love it.

69
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,586
我最懂得怎么安抚小孩子了 
I'm down with the kids.

70
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,876
是阿，老兄，你就是个爱吹嘘的家伙 
Oh, yeah dude. You're the bomb.

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,600
好吧 
Okay,

72
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,041
你换挡的时候要踩两下离合器 
You gotta double pump the clutch when you shift

73
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,998
除了这个，你应该没什么问题的 
Besides that, you should be good.

74
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,151
是这个吗？ 
That's this one?

75
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:29,300
对，就是那个 
Yeah, right there.

76
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,250
好的 
Alright.

77
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,995
你要搭便车去学校吗 ? 
You want a ride to school or something?

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,675
我上的是保留区里的学校 
I go to school on the reservation.

79
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,132
哦，好吧 
Oh, right.

80
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,650
太糟了，我好不容易才有个认识的人 
That's too bad. It would've been good to know one person.

81
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,429
我到新学校的第一天 
My first day in a new school.

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,899
那是三月，正好是学期中 
It's March, the middle of the semester.

00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:54,537
好极了 
Great.

不，不是...那是... 
No, no...That's...

102
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,953
你是伊莎贝拉，对吧 ? 
You're Isabella, right?

104
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,952
是啦，嗨！我是麦克...纽顿

很高兴见到你 
Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,364
她让你碰了个大钉子，哈 ?
She's got a great spike, huh?

107
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,313
顺便说一下，我叫洁西卡 
I'm Jessica, by the way.

108
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,521
嘿，你从亚利桑那州来的对吧？ 
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?

109
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,301
对 
Yeah.

110
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:24,374
亚利桑那州的人不都是...小麦肤色吗？ 
Aren't people from Arizona supposed to be like...really tan?

111
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,501
是啊，这大概就是我被他们踢出来的原因吧 
Yeah, maybe that's why they kicked me out.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,180
你好样的 
You're good.

113
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:35,740
很有趣 
That's so funny

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,001
一件杰出的事 ...
A Master Piece...

116
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,809
嗨，麦克！见见我邻家的女孩，贝拉

00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,260

我的女孩

121
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,405
喔，天哪 
Oh my God,

122
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,675
真像是又回到一年级的幼稚模样 
it's like first grade all over again.

123
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,676
你就像是最闪亮的新玩具 
You're the shiny new toy.

124
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,263
笑一个！ 
Smile!

125
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:11,866
好... 
Okay...

128
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,000
好吧，我只是.. 
It's okay, I just...

129
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,105
我挺你，宝贝 
I got your back, baby.

130
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,469
我想将讨论的方向转为青少年酗酒 
I guess we'll just turn another editorial on teen drinking.

131
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,879
其实你可以讨论...暴饮暴食... 游泳队的竞速计划 .... 
You can always go for...The eating disorders...Speedo padding on the swim team...

134
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:33,519
说真的，这个点子不错 
Actually, that's a good one.

135
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,133
是啊，对，我就是这么想的 
Yeah, right. That's exactly what I thought.

136
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,053
我们是在讨论奥林匹克的规格了 
We're talking Olympic size.

137
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:41,000
那是不可能的，他太瘦了，太不协调了 
There's no way, he's so skinny.It doesn't make sense.

138
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:41,800
绝对 
Totally

139
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:46,469
他们是谁？ 
Who are they?

140
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,885
库伦家族 
The Cullens.

141
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,966
他们 呃... 
They're, um...

142
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,801
库伦医生夫妇领养的孩子 
Dr. and Mrs. Cullen foster kids.

143
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:57,007
几年前他们从阿拉斯加搬来这儿 
They moved down here from Alaska a few years ago.

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,716
他们只和自己人相处 
They kind of keep to themselves.

145
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,129
对，因为他们都同进同出 
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

146
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,516
就像是双双对对 
Like together together.

147
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,755
那个金发的女孩叫罗丝莉 而那个大个子的黑发男生是艾密特 
The blond girl, that's Rosalie,and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.

149
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,618
看起来还真像是情侣 
They're like a thing.

151
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,784
洁西，他们没有血缘关系 
Jess, they're not actually related.

152
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,246
对啊，但他们竟然住一起...这太怪了 
Yeah, but they live together...It's weird.

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,000
那个身材娇小的黑发女生叫艾莉丝 
The little dark-haired girl is Alice.

155
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,793
她才真诡异呢 
She's really weird.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,534
还有...她与贾斯柏是一对，金发的那个 他看起来好像生病似的 
And...She's with Jasper, the blonde one,who looks like he's in pain.

158
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:38,426
库伦医生就像个婚姻中介所的养父 
Dr.Cullen is like this foster dad-slash-match maker.

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,446
也许他会收养我 
Maybe he'll adopt me.

160
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,118
这又是谁 ? 
Who's he?

161
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,657
他是...爱德华库伦 
That's...Edward Cullen.

162
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,540
很明显的，他倒是挺迷人的 
He's totally gorgeous, obviously.

163
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,814
但更明显的是，这儿还没有能与他匹配的人 
But apparently nobody here is good enough for him.

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,245
所以... 呃 .... 
So...Yeah...

166
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,384
说真的，你可别浪费时间去...
Seriously, don't waste your time...

167
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,235
我才没那个兴趣 
I wasn't planning on it.

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,246
莫利纳先生 ? 
Mr. Molina ?

169
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:22,665
嗨，麦克 
Hey, Mike.

170
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,372
喔，好的...史旺小姐 
Oh, yes... Ms.Swan.

172
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,301
这是你的讲义，好吗 ? 
Here's your stuff, okay?

173
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,551
还有...我帮你在这安排了个位子 
And...I got a seat for you right here

174
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:49,098
是在最后一个 所以... 
it's the last one so...

175
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,003
跟紧点，你会跟上进度的 
Just tag along until you catch up.

176
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:54,835
好了，同学们，今天我们要观察涡虫的行为 
Alright guys, today we're gonna be observing the behavior of Planaria,

179
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,000
物理？生物化学？ 
Physics? Biochem?

180
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,556
每个课程人数都额满了，亲爱的 
Every class is full, my dear.

181
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,306
我刚刚查过了 
I just checked in here.

182
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:45,329
恐怕你只能继续上生物课了 
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in Biology.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
好吧，我只能...试着去忍受了 
Fine, I'll just...accept to endure it.

184
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,383
我只是还不能习惯你已经长这么大了 而且还这么漂亮
I just can't get over how grown up you are.And so gorgeous.

嗨，贝拉 !

187
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,583
你还记得我吗？ 
You remember me?

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,821
有一年我扮圣诞老人.. 
I played Santa one year...

189
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:21,166
是阿，维隆，她四岁以后就没在这里过圣诞节了 
Yeah, Waylon.She hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.

190
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,316
我打赌我给你留下印象了，不是吗？ 
I bet I made an impression, didn't I?

191
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,687
你一直都是这样的 
You always do.

192
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,094
露股沟的圣诞老人 
Bad crack Santa.

193
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,800
嘿，但是孩子们可喜欢那些小瓶子了 
Hey! Kids love those little bottles though.

194
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,224
维隆，你让她好好的享受花园汉堡吧 
Let the girl eat her Garden Burger, Waylon.

195

嘿，宝贝，听着 
Hey baby! So listen,

201
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:00,429
假如费尔的训练结束了 
if Phil's training goes well,

202
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,170
我们可能搬到佛罗里达 
we could be moving to Florida.

204
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,750
妈妈，你的手机呢 ？
Mom, where's your cel?

205
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,895
好吧，不准笑 
Okay, don't laugh.

206
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,943
我的充电器没有掉，只是它跑走了 
I didn't lose my power cord, it ran away.

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
笑死人了 
Screaming.

208
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,454
我现在渐渐讨厌高科技了 
I literally repel technology now.

209
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:16,780
我很想你 
I miss you.

210
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,942
喔，宝贝！我也很想你 
Oh, Baby! I miss you too.

211
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,752
告诉我些你学校的事吧...那里的孩子怎么样？ 
But tell me more about your school...What are the kids like?

212
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,535
有没有可爱的男生 ? 
Are there any cute guys?

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,712
他们对你好吗？ 
Are they being nice to you?

214
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:30,960
呃...他们都很"欢迎"我 
Well...They're all very welcoming.

215
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,706
喔哦，都说来听听吧 
Uh-oh. Tell me all about it.

216
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:35,800
也没什么重要的 
It doesn't even matter.

218
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,337
可是我要做作业了
 I have homework to do.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,107
我晚点打给你吧 
I'll talk to you later.

220
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,573
好吧，我爱你
Okay, I love you.

221
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:43,440
我也爱你 
Love you too.

222
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,886
我打算直接面对他
 I planned to confront him.

223
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,210
去搞清楚他到底有什么毛病 
And demand to know what his problem was.

224
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,873
但他没再出现了 
But he never showed.

225
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,738
贝拉！ 
Bella!

226
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,911
过了一天...
And the next day...

227
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,393
还是没出现 
Another no-show.

228
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,437
几天过去了 
More days passed.

229
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,789
事情似乎变得有点... 怪怪的 
And things were getting a little...Strange.

231
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,500
你没事吧？ 
Are you alright?

232
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,368
是，我没事
 Yeah, I'm good.

233
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,404
地上结冰后就无法止滑 
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

234
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:41,006
对啊，所以我帮你的卡车换上新轮胎了 
Yeah,that's why I had some new tires put on the truck.

235
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,561
旧的轮胎表面已经磨平了 
The old ones were getting really bold.

236
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,100
嗯， 我可能来不及回来吃晚餐了 
Well, I'll probably be late for dinner.

237
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,000
我必须赶到梅森郡 
Gotta head down to Mason County.

238
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:50,080
有个杰里逊面粉厂的警卫，不知道被甚么野兽咬死了 
A security guard at the Grisham mill got killed by some kind of animal.

241
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,851
总之，我打算增加人手 
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

242
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,463
小心点 
Be careful.

243
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,732
我一向都如此 
Always am.

244
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,500
谢谢你帮我换轮胎 
And thanks for the tires.

245
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,608
没什么
 Yeah.

246
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
舞会委员就像是个乌合之众 
Prom Committee is a chick thing ,

247
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,000
但我帮他们把文宣的部分搞定了 
but I got it covered for the paper anyway,

249
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,200
我需要你的播放清单
 I need your playlist.

250
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,333
嘿！听好，我在想... 
Hey! Listen, I was wondering...

251
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,448
嗯，你是否已经有约... 
Um, Did you have a date to the...

254
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,480
你会渐渐适应的 
You gotta get used to it.

255
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,967
嘿，麦克，你真好笑 
Hey Mike, you're real cute man.

256
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:40,869
哦，不 ...
Oh, no...

257
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,223
你好 
Hello.

258
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,831
我很抱歉，上个礼拜没机会自我介绍
 I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to introduce myself last week.

259
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,054
我是爱德华 库伦 
I'm Edward Cullen.

260
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,314
你叫贝拉 ? 
You're Bella?

261
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,914
对 
Yes.

262
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,800
洋葱根端细胞 !

264
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,682
把它分开，并且将不同的分裂阶段记下来 
So separate and label them into the phases of Mitosis.

265
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,200
第一对完成的会拿到这个奖品 
And the first partners to get it right are gonna win.

266
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,149
金洋葱！ 
The golden onion!

267
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,106
女士优先 
Ladies first...

269
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:41,068
是的，我出城了几天 
Yeah. I was out of town for a couple of days.

270
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:42,976
私人原因 
Personal reasons.

271
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,355
初期 
Prophase.

272
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,234
你介意... 我看一下吗？ 
You mind if I... look?

273
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,564
是初期 
It's prophase.

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
我就说了吧 
Like I said.

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,247
那么...你喜欢下雨天吗? 
So... You're enjoying the rain?

276
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,953
什么？
 What?

277
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,147
你是在问我天气吗？
 You're asking me about the weather?

278
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,730
是啊 ... 
Yeah...

279
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,886
我想是吧 
I guess I am.

280
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,680
其实，我不太喜欢下雨 
Well, I don't really like the rain.

283
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,300
而且我真的...
And I'm really...

284
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,375
什么？ 
What?

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
没事 
Nothing.

286
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:40,252
这是...后期 
It's... Anaphase

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,351
介意我检查一下吗？ 
You mind if I check?

288
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,551
当然不介意 
Sure.

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,047
后期 
Anaphase.

290
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,983
我就说了吧 
Like I said.

292
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:04,337
你怎会想搬来全美最潮湿的地方呢？ 
why did you move to wettest place in the continental U.S.?

293
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,475
这说来很复杂 
It's complicated.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,782
呃，我妈妈再婚了而且...
 Um, my mom remarried and...

296
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,500
所以你不喜欢那个男的？ 
So, you don't like the guy?

297
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,814
不，不是那样的...费尔人不错 
No, that's not...Phil's really nice.

298
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
中期，你要检查吗？
 It's Metaphase.  You wanna check it?

299
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,700
不了，我相信你 
No, I believe you.

300
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,156
你怎么不跟你妈妈和费尔住 ? 
Why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?

301
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,617
呃，费尔是小联盟的棒球员 
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player.

303
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,500
我妈妈待在家陪我 
My mom stayed home with me

305
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:13,246
我想我应该和我爸住一段时间...
 I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while...

308
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,133
抱歉，我只是想试着了解你 
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure you out.

309
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,500
你对我来说很难看透 
You're very difficult for me to read.

310
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,500
你戴隐形眼镜吗？ 
did you get contacts?

311
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
没有 
No.

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,718
上次我看见你时，你的眼睛是黑色的，可是现在...是金棕色了
 Your eyes were black the last time I saw you and now...They're like golden-brown.

314
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,565
对，我知道，那是 ... 呃...是荧光效应 
Yeah, I know. It's the... Um...it's the fluorescence.

316
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,153
贝拉，真的很抱歉 ....我吓坏了 
Bella, I'm so sorry... I panicked.

318
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,200
贝拉
 Bella

319
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,500
你没事吧？
 are you okay?

320
00:21:57,969 --> 00:21:59,400
你给我好好说清楚 
You and I are gonna talk.

321
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,100
你没事吧？ 
You alright ?

322
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:01,300
爸，我没事，冷静点
 I'm fine dad, calm down.

323
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
我真的很对不起你，贝拉，我煞不住车
 I'm sorry Bella, I tried to stop.

324
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
我知道，没关系
 I know, it's okay.

325
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:07,690
不，混蛋，我很确定那很不好 
No, as sure as hell it's not okay.

326
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,250
爸，他不是故意的
 Dad, it wasn't his fault.

327
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,362
你差点没命了，你知道吗？ 
You could've been killed. You understand that?

328
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,600
是的，可是我没有，所以 ...
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

329
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,162
你可以和你的驾照吻别了！ 
You can kiss your license goodbye.

330
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,000
我听说警长的女儿在这儿 
I heard the Chief's daughter was in.

331
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,001
喔，库伦医师 
Oh, Dr.Cullen.

332
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,024

交给我吧，杰克 
I got this one, Jackie.

334
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,200
伊莎贝拉 
Isabella.

335
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
贝拉 
Bella.

336
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,497
好的，贝拉，这看起来是轻微摔伤
 Well, Bella. Looks like it's a quiet spill.

337
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:32,291
很好 
Good.

338
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,600
看这里 
Look here.

339
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,300
你可能处于创伤后压力症候群 
You might experience some post-traumatic stress.

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
我认为你应该没事 
I think you'll be just fine.

343
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,700
贝拉，我真的很抱歉，我实在是... 
I'm so sorry Bella, I'm really...

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
幸好爱德华正在那里，不然我就惨了 
It would have been a lot worse if Edward wasn't there.

345
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,000
他及时把我推开了 
He knocked me out of the way.

346
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,850
爱德华？你的孩子 ? 
Edward? Your boy?

347
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,400
是的，那真是令人惊讶 
Yeah, it was amazing.

348
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:01,500
我意思是，他突然出现在我身边 
I mean, he got to me so fast.

350
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,450
看来你运气很好 
Sounds like you were very lucky.

351
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
查理 
Charlie

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
我还有些文件要处理 
I need to sign some paperwork.

353
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,200
你该给你妈打电话
You should probably call your mom.

354
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,761
你告诉她了？ 
Did you tell her?

355
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,097
她恐怕早已...吓坏了 
She's probably just...freaking out.

357
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,600
不然我该做什么？让她死吗 ? 
What was I supposed to do?Let her die?

358
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,600
这不只是你的事
This isn't just about you.

359
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:35,600
我觉得我们应该到我的办公室谈... 
I think we should talk this in my office...

360
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,700
我能和你谈谈吗？ 
Can I talk to you for a minute?

361
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,516
罗丝莉... 
Rosalie...

362
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,851
什么事？ 
What?

363
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,813
你...你怎么能那么快就来到我身边 ? 
How...how did you get over to me so fast?

364
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,983
我当时就站在你的身边啊，贝拉 
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

365
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,191
不 
No

366
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:01,384
你是站在你的车旁边...离我很远 
you were next to your car... Across the lot.

367
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,000
不，我没有 
No, I wasn't.

368
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,398
是，你确实是这样的 !
Yes, you were!

369
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:13,900
贝拉，你撞到了头...我想你有点精神错乱了 
Bella, you hit your head... I think you're confused.

370
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:15,851
我很清楚我看见了什么 
I know what I saw.

371
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,900
那究竟是怎么回事 ?
 What exactly was that?

372
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:23,446
你...你把车子挡下来了 
You...You stopped the van.

373
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,715
你用手把它推开了 
You pushed it away with your hand.

374
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,638
呃，我想没有人会相信你说的，所以... 
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

375
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,691
我不会告诉任何人的 
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

376
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:37,397
我只想知道...真相 
I just need to know...the truth.

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
你就不能谢谢我然后忘了这件事吗？ 
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

378
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,450
谢谢你 
Thank you.

379
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,153
你不能让这件事就这么过去吗 ? 
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

380
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:47,000
不能 
No

381
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,000
那好吧，我想你会尽情享受失望的 
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

382
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,400
那是我第一次梦见爱德华 库伦 
That was the first night I dreamt with Edward Cullen.

383
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,900
每个人把通行证拿出来，所以...
I need everybody's permission slips, so...

384
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:38,500
走吧 
Let's go

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,537
看看你，哼 ? 
Look at you, huh?

386
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,000
你还活着！ 
You're alive!

387
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,900
我知道，是啊...我猜是个假警报 
I know, Yeah... False alarm, I guess.

388
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,400
嗯，我想问你，你知道的...
Um, now I wanted to ask you, you know...

390
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,052
你想去...舞会吗？ 
Do you wanna go to Prom...?

391
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
所以...你觉得呢？ 
So... What do you think?

392
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,460
关于什么？ 
About what?

398
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,700
对我来说不是好主意 
Not such a good idea for me.

399
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
无论如何，那个周末我有事 
I have something that weekend, anyway.

400
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
我刚好那个周末要去杰克逊维州 
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

401
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,300
你不能在另一个周末去吗？ 
You can't go another weekend?

402
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,800
不能退的车票 
Non-refundable ticket.

403
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,300
你应该去邀请洁西卡的 
You should ask Jessica.

404
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,700
我知道她想和你一起去 
I know she wants to go with you.

405
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,590
呦，呦，呦 
Yo, yo, yo

406
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:52,480
嘿，大伙们！
hey guys! 

408
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,800
好！出发吧！ 
Good! Let's go!

411
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:03,200
蛋壳，胡萝卜叶端.. 
Eggshells, carrot-tops...

414
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,100
很棒，很棒 
Very good, very good.

415
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:13,100
现在我要做一杯热腾腾的堆肥茶 
Now I'm gonna make a steaming cup of compost-tea.

416
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,600
给我.. 
Give me that..

418
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,746
那个不能喝啦！那是给植物喝的... 
Don't drink it! It's for the plants...

419
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,700
去杰克逊维州做什么呢 ? 
What's in Jacksonville?

420
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,200
你怎么知道的? 
How did you know about that?

421
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
我...你没回答我的问题 
I...You didn't answer my question.

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,680
这个嘛，你也没回答过我的问题，所以... 
Well, you don't answer any of mine, so...

424
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,800
嗨 
Hi

425
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,500
你愿意告诉我，你是怎么挡住车子的吗 ? 
Are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van?

426
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:46,000
是啊...我的肾上腺素上升 
Yeah...I had an adrenaline rush.

427
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,300
那很正常 
It's very common.

428
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,100
你可以上谷歌查 
You can Google it.

429
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,800
佛罗里达人...
Floridians...

432
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,738
听我说... 我很抱歉一直都不太有礼貌 
Look... I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.

433
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:06,920
我只是认为这样是最好的方式 
I just think it's the best way.

434
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:09,232
贝拉！猜猜谁约我去舞会
Bella! Guess who's just asked me to Prom.

436
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:18,200
呃，你不觉得这有点奇怪吗 ? 
Um, it's not gonna be weird though, right?

437
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:20,200
不会，一点都不奇怪 
No, zero weirdness.

438
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,200
大伙儿都在，真好 
You guys are great together.

440
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,200
贝拉，你看 
Bella, look.

441
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,300
一条虫...一条虫...
It's a worm... It's a worm...

442
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
贝拉...我们不应该做朋友的 
Bella...We shouldn't be friends.

444
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,900
我意思是，你当初为什么不让车子压扁我 ？
I mean, why didn't you just let the van crush me?

446
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
你认为我后悔救了你？ 
You think I regret saving you?

449
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,600
你什么都不知道 
You don't know anything.

451
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,600
不，我们的巴士坐满了 
No, our bus is full.

452
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
你妈妈又...打来了 
Your mom called...Again.

453
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,100
好吧，都怪你 
Well, that's your fault.

454
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,949
你不该告诉她这件小意外的 
You shouldn't have told her about the almost-accident.

455
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,826
你吃完了吗？ 
Are you finished?

456
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:20,900
是的 
Yeah.

458
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,800
她似乎跟以前不太一样 
She seems different.

460
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,873
费尔听起来像是个不错的男人 
Phil sounds like an alright guy.

461
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
是阿，他是不错 
Yeah, he is.

462
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
好吧... 
Alright...

464
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,550
那代表什么意思 ? 
Should I know what that means?

471
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:15,753
那边还有鲸鱼可以看呢，和我们一起去吧 
But there's whale watching too. Come with us.

477
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,099
贝拉 
Bella.

478
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,500
谢谢 
Thanks.

479
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:36,113
你知道吗，你的态度反反复覆真令人难以捉摸 
You know, your mood swings are kind of giving me a whiplash.

480
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,299
我只说我们不做朋友会比较好 但那不是我所想要的 
I only said it'd be better for you if we weren't friends,not that I didn't want to be.

482
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:42,571
那是什么意思 ？ 
What does that mean?

483
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:47,245
意思是你够聪明的话，应该离我远些 
It means, if you're smart, you'd stay away from me.

485
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:52,712
你愿意告诉我真相吗 ? 
Will you tell me truth?

486
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:54,218
不，可能不会 
No, probably not.

487
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:57,228
我宁可听听你的理论 
I'd rather hear your theories.

490
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,141
都是些超级英雄，对吗？ 
That's all super-hero stuff, right?

491
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:11,020
那如果我不是英雄呢？ 
What if I'm not the hero?

492
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:12,216
如果我是... 坏人呢？ 
What if I'm...the bad guy?

494
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:15,203
你不是的 
You're not.

495
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,435
我能理解你为何想推拖 
I can see what you're trying to put off.

498
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,061
不如我们... 一起聚会 ?
Why don't we just...hang out?

500
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:33,800
大家都要去海边 
Everybody is going to the beach.

501
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:34,894
一起来吧 
Come

502
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,085
我的意思是，很好玩 
I mean, have fun.

503
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,938
哪个海滩？ 
Which beach?

505
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,500
我不知道 
I don't know.

506
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,260
那个海滩有什么不好吗？ 
Is there something wrong with that beach?

507
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,534
只是有点拥挤 
It's just a little crowded.

508
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,200
冷死了 
Its freezing.

509
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,421
你应该出来走走的，伙计 
You gotta go out, folks.

510
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,366
我都不知道是否值得这么做 
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

514
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,553
所以我一直期待艾瑞克邀请我去舞会 
So, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask me to the Prom

515
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,197
但...他却没有 
And he just...doesn't.

516
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,065
你应该去邀请他 
You should ask him.

517
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,783
主动点，你是个独立的女强人 
Take control. You are a strong independent woman.

518
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:28,486
我是吗？ 
I am?

519
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,487
是的 
Yes.

520
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:31,753
你能帮帮我吗？ 
Can you help me out?

521
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:32,754
好啊 
Yeah.

522
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:35,659
贝拉！ 
Bella!

523
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,098
嗨，雅各布！大伙们，这是雅各布 
Hi Jacob!Guys, this is Jacob.

525
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,000
嗨 
Hi.

526
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,100
嘿 
Hey.

527
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:43,476
你想干嘛，跟踪我吗？ 
What are you, like, stalking me?

528
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,330
你可是在我的地盘呢，记得吗？ 
You're on my rez, remember?

529
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,726
你冲浪吗 ? 
Are you surfing?

530
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:49,744
当然不是 
Definitely not.

531
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:52,581
你们应该陪陪贝拉 
You guys should keep Bella company.

532
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:53,581
呃，她的约会泡汤了 
Um,her date bailed.

533
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:54,582
什么约会？ 
What date?

534
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,448
她邀请了爱德华 
She invited Edward.

535
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,077
只是出于礼貌而已 
To be polite, that's it.

536
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,500
我觉得她不错，敢去约爱德华，没有人试过 
I think it's nice she invited him.Nobody ever does.

537
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,011
是啊，因为库伦家都是怪胎 
Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.

538
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,480
你还真说对了 !
You got that right!

539
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,493
你们认识他？ 
You guys know him?

540
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:07,537
库伦家族不会来这里的 
The Cullens don't come here.

543
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,950
你听到了，呃? 
You caught that, huh?

544
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,700
我不该说任何关于这件事的 
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

545
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:30,500
嘿，我会保密的 
Hey, I can keep a secret.

546
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,100
呃，这就像是个古老的恐怖故事 
Um, really it's just like an old scary story.

547
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,963
好，我想知道 
Well, I want to know.

549
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,396
什么？ 
What?

550
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,100
像狼...真的野狼？ 
Like wolves... Real wolves?

551
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,563
是的...其实那就是我们部族的传说 
Yeah...That's a legend of our tribe.

552
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:59,486
好吧，那这个跟库伦家族有什么关系 ? 
Okay. So, what's the story about the Cullens?

555
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:13,043
我的曾祖父，酋长，曾发现他们在我们的土地狩猎 
My great-grandfather, the chief,found them hunting on our land.

556
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:19,004
但他们自认为是异类，所以我们就缔结了约定 
But they claimed to be something different, so we made a treaty with them.

557
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,677
如果他们不踏入库利特斯这片领地 
If they promised to say off Quileute lands,

558
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:24,299
那我们也不会泄露他们真正的身份... 给白种人知道 
Then we wouldn't expose what they really were...to the pale faces.

560
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,094
我以为他们才刚搬来这 
I thought they just moved here.

562
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,005
那他们到底是什么东西？ 
What are they really?

563
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,854
这只是个故事，贝拉 
It's just a story, Bella.

564
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,708
来吧，我们走吧 
Come on, let's go.

565
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,472
我妈妈说我不会哄小猫叫... 
My mamma said I didn't know how to make a kitten meow...

566
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,472
你好？ 
Hello?

567
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:19,712
小妞？ 
Girl?

568
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,400
小妞！ 
Girl!

569

外套很好看 
Nice jacket.

571
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:49,842
你是谁？ 
Who are you?

572
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:52,107
总是千篇一律的蠢问题 
It's always the same inane questions.

576
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:00,051
詹姆斯... 
James...

577
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,906
别再戏弄我们的食物了 
Let's not play with our food.

00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,873
他不在这里 
He's not here.

584
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,927
每当天气好的时候，库伦家族就消失了 
Whenever the weather's nice the Cullens disappear.

586
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:05,807
不，库伦夫妇会带着他们去旅行、露营、吃东西 
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for hiking and camping and stuff.

589
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,117
我邀请他...我采取主动了 
I just asked him... I took control.

590
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:14,615
我就说过这会管用的 
I told you that would happen.

592
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,739
哦，是的，家里的一些杂事要处理 
Oh, yeah. It's a weird family thing.

593
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,992
好吧，我们该去安吉拉斯港购物了 免得被别人抢先买光了
Okay, we should go shopping to Port Angeles before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

595
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:28,140
安吉拉斯港？ 
Port Angeles?

596
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,907
你们介意我去吗？ 
You mind if I come?

598
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:35,154
我喜欢这件 
I like this one

599
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:36,155
很正点 
That's cool.

600
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,138
但是我搞不懂这种细肩带的 
But I don't know about the one-shoulder thing

601
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:38,968
我喜欢这件 
I like this one.

602
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,764
对，我喜欢这种编织 
Yeah, I like the knitting.

603
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,122
洁西，你觉得怎么样？熏衣草色？ 
Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

604
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:43,371
那个好吗 ? 颜色适合我吗 ? 
Is that good? Is that my color?

605
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:46,124
我喜欢，我偏好暗玫瑰色这件 
I like it. I like that dusty-rose one too.

606
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,125
喔，我喜欢这件 ...
Okay, I like this one... 

609
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:55,106
那感觉满不舒服的 
That is uncomfortable.

610
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,152
呃，蛮恶心的... 
Oh, it's disgusting...

611
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,260
贝拉，你觉得怎么样？ 
Bella, what do you think?

612
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,802
看起来不错 
Looks great.

613
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,761
前五件礼服，你都说一样的话耶 
You said that about the last five dresses though.

614
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,281
我觉得都很不错啊 
I thought they were pretty good.

615
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:09,696
你对这不感兴趣，对吗？ 
Not really into this, are you?

616
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,437
其实，我只是想去书店 
I, actually, really just wanna go to this bookstore.

617
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:15,633
那我们在餐厅见吧 ? 
Meet you guys at the restaurant?

618
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:16,895
你确定？ 
Are you sure?

619
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:18,483
嗯，待会见 
Yeah, see you in a minute.

620
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:19,000
好的 
Okay.

621
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,000
好 
Okay.

624
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,539
晚安 
Good night.

625
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:32,541
谢谢 
Thank you.

626
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,989
我们在服饰店见过 
We saw you at the dress shop.

627
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,275
嘿，你要去哪里？ 
Hey, where are you running to?

628
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,206
她在这呢… 
There she is...

629
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:13,839
大家好吗 ? 
How are you guys doing?

630
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,986
怎么了，小妞 ? 
What's up, girl?

631
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,109
哇!你要去哪？ 
Whoa! Where are you going?

632
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,244
你要去哪？ 
Where are you going?

633
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,020
跟我们一起聚聚吧 
Hang out with us.

634
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:23,200
有什么问题吗？ 
What's the problem?

635
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,111
你真漂亮 
You're pretty.

636
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,350
别碰我 
Don't touch me.

637
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:26,911
说真的 ，你应该...
Seriously, you should...

638
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,185
别碰我！ 
Don't touch me!

639
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:37,518
上车 
Get in the car.

640
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:42,900
刚刚真的是个很危险的...举动 
That was a very dangerous... move.

641
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,850
我应该回去把那些家伙的头拧下来的 
I should go back there and rip those guy's heads off.

642
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,723
不，你不可以 
No, you shouldn't.

643
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,662
你不知道他们卑鄙下流的脑袋在想什么 
You don't know the vile, repulsive things they're thinking.

645
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,591
这并不难猜 
It was not hard to guess.

646
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,384
你能说些别的话题... 来分散我的注意力，好让我不调头回去吗？
Can you talk about something else...and distract me so I won't turn around?

648
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:28,434
你能系上安全带吗？ 
Can you just put your seatbelt on?

649
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,448
系上你自己的就可以了 
Put your own seatbelt on.

651
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,331
你去哪了 ? 我们有留讯息给你 
Where were you? We left you messages.

652
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:45,206
我们有等你，但是肚子饿了，所以我们.. 
We waited but we were starving, so we...

653
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:49,058
我很抱歉我耽误了贝拉的晚餐 
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

654
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,325
我们凑巧遇到，然后聊太久了 
We just ran into each other and got talking.

655
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:57,429
我们能理解，我的意思是 ...
we totally understand, I mean...

656
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,045
碰巧，对吗？ 
That happens, right?

657
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:02,605
嗯，我们要走了，那么… 
Um, we were just leaving so...

658
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,049
贝拉，你要 ...
Bella, you wanna...

659
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,882
我想我该让贝拉吃点东西 
I think I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.

661
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,064
我会开车送你回家的 
I'll drive you home myself.

662
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:17,092
那真是...太体贴了 
That's so... thoughtful.

663
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:19,392
对啊，真是贴心 
It's really thoughtful, yeah.

664
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,814
对，我该吃点东西 
Yeah, I should eat something.

665
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,860
好吧，那就...明天见了 
Okay, so... I'll see you tomorrow.

666
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,311
再见... 
See you...

667
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,360
好 
Okay.

668
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:42,307
好的，一份蘑菇馄饨 
All right, one mushroom ravioli.

669
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:44,123
谢谢 
Thanks.

671
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:48,807
呃...真的不必帮你点什么吗 ? 
So...Are you sure there isn't anything I can get for you?

672
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,029
不用了，谢谢你 
No, thank you.

674
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,512
你真的不吃点东西吗? 
You're really not gonna eat?

675
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:06,828
不，我只是在...节食中 
No, I'm on a... special diet.

676
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:09,903
你真的该给我一些解释 
You gotta give me some answers.

677
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,104
是的...不... 
Yes... No...

681
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,509
你早就知道? 
You knew that?

682
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,284
你怎么知道我在哪里的？ 
How did you know where I was?

683
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:26,479
我不知道 
I didn't.

684
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:28,155
好吧... 
Alright...

685
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:31,178
别走... 
Don't leave...

686
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:37,796
你在...跟踪我吗 ?
 Did you...follow me?

687
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:45,651
我只是感觉...很想保护你 
I feel very... protective of you.

688
00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:48,719
所以你跟踪我了 
So you followed me.

689
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,067
我试着与你保持距离 除非你需要我帮助，然后... 
I was trying to keep a distance unless you needed my help and then...

691
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:56,621
接着我听见那些人渣在想的事情... 
I heard what those low-lives were thinking...

692
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:57,652
等等 
Wait

693
00:42:58,584 --> 00:43:00,715
你说你能听见他们在想什么？ 
You say you heard what they were thinking?

694
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,936
那是什么...你会读人的心思.. 
So what...You read minds...

695
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:15,809
我能读这屋子里每个人的心思 除了你之外 
I can read every mind in this room apart from yours.

697
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,903
钱...性... 
Money...Sex...

698
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,143
钱...性... 
Money... Sex...

699
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:30,376
猫 
Cat.

700
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:36,881
然后你...完全没有 
And then you... Nothing.

701
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,243
那让我很有挫折感 
It's very frustrating.

702
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,532
我算不正常吗 ? 
There's something wrong with me?

703
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:51,232
我说我能读心，而你却说你不正常 
I tell you I can read minds and you think there's something wrong with you.

704
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,629
怎么了? 
What is it?

705
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,396
我已没有... 能力... 再和你保持距离了
I don't have...the strength...to stay away from you anymore.

708
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,956
那就不要 
Then don't.

709
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:34,223
好了，我觉得我够暖和了 
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.

710
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,140
你的手很冰 
Your hand is so cold.

711
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,865
哇!怎么回事？ 
Whoa! What is going on?

712
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:01,932
我爸的车还在这，你能开进去吗 ? 
My dad's still here.Can you pull in?

713
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,032
我爸的车也在这 
It's my father's car in there.

714
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,534
他在这做什么？ 
What is he doing here?

715
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,208
卡莱尔，发生甚么事了? 
Carlisle, what's going on?

717
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:21,937
我刚验完尸 
I just examined the body.

718
00:45:22,643 --> 00:45:23,570
他死了？ 
He died?

719
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:25,992
怎么会？ 
How?

720
00:45:26,278 --> 00:45:27,488
被野兽袭击 
Animal attack.

724
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:36,420
贝拉 
Bella

725
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,698
你该进去里面 
you should go inside.

726
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:39,720
维隆是你父亲的朋友 
Waylon was your father's friend.

727
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:41,700
好的 
Okay

728
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:46,754
呃，等会儿见 
Um, I'll see you later.

729
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,600
嘿 ...

爸爸，我很难过

733
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,029
别担心，我们会查出真凶的 
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.

735
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:38,215
我要你随身携带这个 
I want you to carry this with you.

736
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,659
这能让你老爸安心点
It would give your old man some peace of mind.

737
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,666
我们回家吧 
Let's go home.

753
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,041
你有令人难以置信的速度 而且强而有力

你的皮肤苍白且寒冷如冰

756

你的眼睛会变色...

00:49:56,222 --> 00:49:57,809
有时候你的说话的方式像是... 就像你来自不同的年代

759
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:03,766
你不吃也不喝任何东西 
You never eat or drink anything.

760
00:50:03,828 --> 00:50:05,203
你从不出现在阳光下 
You don't go out in the sunlight.

761
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:10,755

772

你不会伤害我的 
You won't hurt me.

775
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,654
我们要去哪？ 
Where are we going?

776
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:35,405
到山顶上，没有云雾垄罩的地方 
Up the mountain, out of the cloud bag.

777
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:38,231
你必须看看我在阳光下的样子 
You need to see what I look like in the sunlight.

778
00:51:57,888 --> 00:52:00,334
这就是为何我们不在阳光下暴露的原因 
This is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.

779
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:02,504
人们会发现我们是异类 
People would know we're different.

780
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,827
这就是真正的我 
This is what I am.

781
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,164
看起来像钻石似的... 
It's like diamonds...

782
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:32,986
你好美 
You're beautiful.

783
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,824
美？这可是杀人魔的皮肤呢，贝拉 
Beautiful?This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

784
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,456
我就是一个杀人魔 
I'm a killer.

785
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:51,862
我不相信 
I don't believe that.

786
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,122
那是因为你只相信谎言 ...
That's because you believe the lie...

787
00:52:56,395 --> 00:52:57,968
那都是骗人的 
It's camouflage.

788
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:03,074
我是世界上最危险的掠食者 
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

789
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:07,468
我所有的一切都在引诱你过来 
Everything about me invites you in.

790
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:11,469
我的声音，容貌 ...甚至我的气味 
My voice, my face... Even my smell.

794
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:32,594
我天生就是个掠杀者 
I'm designed to kill.

795
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:37,205
我不在乎 
I don't care.

796
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,364
我以前杀过人 
I've killed people before.

797
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,838
那没关系 
It doesn't matter.

798
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,764
我曾想过要杀了你 
I wanted to kill you.

799
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:58,850
我一生从未如此渴望的想要一个人的血 
I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.

800
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:01,043
我信任你 
I trust you.

801
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,062
别这么想 
Don't.

802
00:54:06,405 --> 00:54:07,878
我就在这，我相信你 
I'm here, I trust you.

803
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,656
我的家族，我们跟同类有所不同 
My family, we're different from others of our kind.

804
00:54:15,657 --> 00:54:17,559
我们只猎杀动物 
We only hunt animals.

805
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,271
我们已经学会控制身体的欲望 
We've learned to control our thirst.

806
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,517
至于你 ...你的气息 ... 对我来说像是毒品
As to you... Your scent...is like a drug to me.

812
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,845
我到现在还不知道是否控制得了自己 
I still don't know if I can control myself.

813
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:55,715
我知道你可以的 
I know you can.

814
00:55:04,028 --> 00:55:06,098
我读不到你的心 
I can't read your mind,

815
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:09,457
你得告诉我你现在在想什么 
you have to tell me what you're thinking.

816
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:13,896
现在我害怕了 
Now I'm afraid.

817
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,111
很好 
Good.

818
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:23,367
我不是害怕你... 
I'm not afraid of you...

819
00:55:26,913 --> 00:55:28,891
我只是害怕失去你 
I'm only afraid of losing you.

821
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:41,500
你不知道我等了你多久 
You don't know how long I've waited for you.

822
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:52,775
就这样，狮子爱上了羔羊 
And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.

823
00:55:56,305 --> 00:55:58,157
多蠢的羔羊 
What a stupid lamb.

824
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:01,724
多病态又自虐的狮子 
What a sick, masochistic lion.

826
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:35,017
首先，爱德华是个吸血鬼 
First, Edward was a vampire.

830
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,597
第三 我已经毫无保留地，无可救药地爱上了他 
And third,I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

832
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:08,044
蒙地卡罗？这是我们舞会的主题？ 
Monte Carlo? That's our Prom theme?

833
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:12,013
嗯，赌博...燕尾服... 
Uhu, gambling...Tuxedos...

834
00:58:12,014 --> 00:58:13,395
还有庞德 ...詹姆士庞德 
And Bond...James Bond.

835
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,530
喔...我的...天啊 
Oh...My...God

836
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:33,862
你知道吗，大家都开始盯着我们看... 
You know, everybody's staring...

837
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:39,487
那个人不是...
Not that guy...

839
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,128
反正我已经打破所有规矩了 
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

846
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:12,898
那你这样已经多久了？ 
So, how long have you been like this?

847
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,455
从1918年起... 
Since 1918...

850
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:23,659
那是什么样的感觉 ? 
What was it like?

851
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:27,023
那毒液...让人很难忍受 
The venom ...was excruciating

852
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,990
但卡莱尔要承受更多的痛苦与挣扎 
But what Carlisle did was much harder.

853
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:32,593
我们之中没几个能控制得那么好 
Not many of us have the restraint to do that.

854
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:35,352
但是，他不是只需要...咬吗 ? 
But didn't he just have to... bite?

855
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:38,761
不完全是 
Not exactly.

864
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,794
不，那不是唯一的原因 
No, that's not the only reason.

865
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,564
我不想变成一个怪物 
I don't want to be a monster.

866
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:18,389
我们家族自认为是素食者 
My family, we think of ourselves as vegetarians.

867
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,400
因为我们是靠动物的血维生的 
Cause we only survive on the blood of animals.

868
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:27,260
就像是人类只靠奶糖过活一样 
It's...like a human only living on toffee.

871
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,909
是不是有其它的吸血鬼杀了维隆 ? 
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

874
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:53,136
我们时常会碰巧遇到他们 
We run into them from time to time.

875
01:00:54,709 --> 01:00:59,167
你家族的人也和你一样会读心术吗 ? 
Can the rest of your family read people's minds like you can?

876
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:03,667
不，只有我可以 
No. That's just me.

877
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:07,829
不过艾莉丝能预见未来 
But Alice can see the future.

878
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,727
我打赌她看见我来了 
I bet she saw me coming.

879
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,131
艾莉丝的预知是有主观性的 
Alice's vision is subjective.

880
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,296
我的意思是，未来随时会改变的 
I mean, the future can always change.

881
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,390
天啊...你的行为能像个人一样吗 ? 
God...can you act human?

882
01:01:29,392 --> 01:01:30,747
我的意思是我还有邻居 
I mean, I've got neighbors.

883
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:32,493
我明天想要带你去我家 
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

884
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:35,635
谢了 
Thanks.

885
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,868
等等，是要去见你家人吗 ? 
Wait, with your family?

886
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:40,362
对 
Yeah.

887
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:42,683
万一他们不喜欢我怎么办？ 
What if they don't like me?

891
01:01:51,387 --> 01:01:53,300
我很高兴我逗你笑了 
I'm glad I amuse you.

892
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:55,991
怎么了? 
What is it?

893
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:58,986
这说来复杂 
A complication.

894
01:02:00,993 --> 01:02:02,432
我明天来接你 
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

895
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,397
嘿!来拜访你的卡车吗？ 
Hey! Come to visit your truck?

896
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:34,848
看起来不错嘛 
Looks good.

898
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,469
是啊 
Yeah.

899
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,993
其实我们是来拜访你家电视的 
Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

900
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:40,500
本季水手队的首场比赛阿，非看不可 
First Mariners game of the season.

901
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:43,624
再加上雅各布老是嚷着要见你 
Plus, Jacob here keeps bugging me about seeing you again.

902
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,745
好的，爸....谢了 
Great, dad...Thanks.

903
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:48,299
诚实点吧，孩子 
Just keeping it real, son.

904
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:51,388
麦芽白酒 
Pale Ale.

905
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:53,193
干的好，警长 
Well done, Chief.

906
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,314
克尔渥特哈利家传的美味炸鱼 
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

907
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,236
非常好 
Good.

908
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,839
维隆的案子有什么进展吗？ 
Any luck with that Waylon case?

910
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,691
我从不这么认为 
I never thought it was.

911
01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:10,371
你在保留区放话了没，呃 ? 
You spread the word out at the rez, huh?

912
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:11,722
让孩子们远离森林 
Keep the kids out of the woods.

914
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:18,533
不希望再有任何人受伤了，对吧？ 
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

915
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,394
真是令人难以置信 
This is incredible.

916
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:59,462
这地方宽敞又明亮，你知道的 
It's so white and open, you know.

921
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:20,004
这是我们唯一不必躲藏的地方 
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

922
01:04:22,165 --> 01:04:24,289
我吩咐过他们别如此大费周章的 
I told them not to do this.

923
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:29,082
加点橄榄油在这个平底锅上 
You add a little of olive oil to a non-stick saut's pan.

925
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:37,269
她是意大利人？ 
Is she even Italian?

926
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:38,862
她的名字叫贝拉 
Her name is Bella.

927
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:40,621
我肯定不管吃什么她都会喜欢的 
I'm sure she'll love it no matter what.

928
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:43,650
深呼吸看看 
Get a whiff of that

929
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:46,102
有人类来啰 
Here comes the human.

930
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:52,714
贝拉 ! 我们为了你做意大利料理呢 
Bella! We're making Italiano for you.

931
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,462
哦! 
Oh!

932
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,437
贝拉，这是艾丝蜜 
Bella, this is Esme.

933
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,261
我把她当作是亲妈妈 
My mother for all intents and purposes.

936
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:03,296
你让我们第一次有机会用到厨房 
You've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.

937
01:05:03,297 --> 01:05:04,549
我想你一定饿了吧 
I hope you're hungry.

939
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:06,988
她吃过了 
She already ate.

940
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:14,784
好极了！ 
Perfect!

941
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,647
呃，这实在... 
Yeah, it's just...

942
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:19,608
我...我知道你们不吃这些... 
I...I know you guys don't eat...

943
01:05:19,643 --> 01:05:22,464
当然啰，你真善解人意 
Of course, it's very considerate of you.

945
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:28,031
好吧，让我们假装这样对我们大家都很安全 
Yeah, let's just keep pretending like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

946
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:31,682
我绝不会告诉任何人的 
I would never tell anybody anything

948
01:05:33,865 --> 01:05:35,715
对，好吧，但问题是... 
Yeah, well, the problem is...

949
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:37,339
你们两个现在是公开的了，所以... 
You two have become public now, so...

950
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:38,490
艾密特 ! 
Emmett!

951
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:39,910
不，她必须明白 
No,she should know.

952
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:43,293
如果你们结局不好，整个家族都会被牵连的 
The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.

953
01:05:44,192 --> 01:05:46,174
最坏的结果就是... 
Badly as in...

954
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:50,044
我...我变成食物 
I...I become the meal.

955
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:58,381
嗨，贝拉 ! 
Hi, Bella!

956
01:06:02,548 --> 01:06:04,187
我是艾莉丝 
I'm Alice.

957
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,562
嗨 
Hi.

958
01:06:07,595 --> 01:06:09,578
哦，你闻起来确实很不错 
Oh, you do smell good.

961
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,733
抱歉，贾斯柏是最后加入的素食者 
Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

962
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,894
对他来说还有点难适应 
It's a little difficult for him.

963
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,870
很荣幸认识你 
It's a pleasure to meet you.

964
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:27,880
没问题的，贾斯柏，你不会伤害她的 
It's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.

965
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:29,913
好吧... 
Alright...

966
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,788
我带你去四处参观一下吧 
I'm gonna take you on a tour of the rest of the house.

967
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,046
我们待会儿见 
I'll see you soon.

968
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:35,911
好的 
Okay.

969
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,548
很可爱呢 
Cute

970
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:41,772
看来进展的不错 
I think that went well.

971
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:42,966
把这里弄干净 
Clean this up.

972
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:44,293
马上！ 
Now!

973
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:47,519
你应该也跟我一样觉得不自在吧？ 
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

974
01:06:47,594 --> 01:06:49,391
我不知道 
I don't know.

975
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:56,729
毕业帽？ 
Graduation caps?

976
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:58,596
对 
Yeah,

977
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:01,041
这是私下的玩笑 
it's a private joke.

978
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,576
我们入学很多次 
We matriculate a lot.

979
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,835
那有点可怜 
That's kind of miserable.

980
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:09,235
我指的是，不断的重复念高中 
I mean, repeating High School over and over.

没有床？ 
No bed?

987

我不睡觉的 
I don't sleep.

990
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:53,782
好吧... 
Okay...

992

你都听些什么音乐 ?

那就闭上眼睛 
Then close your eyes.

1005

这么美的地方根本不可能存在的 
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

在我的世界里是存在的

我不喜欢这样 
I don't like it,

抱歉我来晚了，生物课作业

我帮你点了猪肉色拉

有，我们发现一个像是人类的赤脚足迹 
Yeah, We found a bare human footprint.

1028
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:50,152
好 
Okay

1029
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:50,860
没问题吧？ 
Okay?

1031
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,836
你朋友似乎在和你打招呼呢 
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

1032

没事的，如果你想去就去吧

你对哪一个有兴趣 ? 
Anybody you're interested?

1040
01:13:27,854 --> 01:13:29,633
爸，我们一定要谈男孩子吗 ? 
Dad, we're gonna talk about boys?

1043
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,185
你应该多去接触人群的 
You should be around people.

1044
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,016
我不介意一个人啊 
I don't mind being alone.

1045
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:46,739
我想这点是老爸遗传给我的

福克斯镇征服我了 
Forks is getting to me.

1055

是不是和哪个男孩有关？ 
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

1056
01:14:16,803 --> 01:14:17,864
对... 
Yeah...

How did you get in here?

1062
01:14:39,122 --> 01:14:40,591
从窗户 
The window.

1063
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,593
你经常这么做？ 
Do you do that a lot?

1064
01:14:44,435 --> 01:14:46,928
几个月前才开始的而已 
Just the past couple months.

我喜欢看你睡觉的样子 
I like watching you sleep.

呃，我只想试试看一件事...

1069
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,620
只要别动就好 
Stay very still.

对...真希望我也能这么说

他对你来说有点老，不是吗？

我以为你喜欢库伦家的人

01:17:35,538 --> 01:17:38,200
我以为你不会喜欢镇上的男孩 
I thought you didn't like any of the boys in town.

1085
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,404
他现在就在门外

1097
01:18:25,803 --> 01:18:26,730
棒球？

01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:28,824
是的，长官，这是预订的行程

我会照顾她的，我保证

你还拿着我给你的防狼喷雾剂吧？ 
You still got that pepper spray?

1103
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,621
是的，爸爸

1104
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:53,082
什么时候吸血鬼也喜欢棒球了？

呃，那是美式消遣

而且刚好有个大雷雨要来了

那是我们唯一可以玩的时候

好吧，现在我知道为何你们需要打雷了

1116
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:54,586
那应该是个全垒打，对吧？

他们本来要离开，但却听见了我们

太迟了 
It's too late.

01:21:47,604 --> 01:21:50,003
我从很远就能闻到她的气味了

我们不知道这个区域已经被认领了

是的，呃...我们在附近有个固定住所

1145
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:58,528
真的吗？

1146
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:04,091
好吧，我们不会再让你们困扰了 
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1147
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:06,451
我们只是路过这里而已 
We were just passing through.

1148
01:23:06,452 --> 01:23:09,693
人类在追捕我们，但我们误导他们去东边了

你们可以再加三个球员吗？

1153
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:22,544
喔，别这样，不过是场游戏而已

1154
01:23:23,245 --> 01:23:24,014
当然 有何不可呢？
Sure,why not?

1156
01:23:25,026 --> 01:23:26,394

01:23:27,526 --> 01:23:29,283
你们先投吧 
You go first.

01:23:29,618 --> 01:23:32,294
我是个擅长投诡异曲球的人 
I'm the one with the wicked curve-ball.

1160

嗯，我认为我们应付的来

1161
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,378
我们走着瞧... 
We shall see...

01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:00,203

01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:08,766
这个女孩和我们是一起的 
The girl is with us.

1165
01:24:09,631 --> 01:24:11,927
我想你们最好还是离开吧 
I think it best if you leave.

1166
01:24:15,559 --> 01:24:17,233
我知道游戏结束了 
I can see the game is over.

1167
01:24:17,362 --> 01:24:19,108
我们现在就走 
We'll go now.

1168
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:23,140
詹姆斯 
James.

1169
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:38,782
带贝拉离开这里...快走 
Get Bella out of here...Go.

1170
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,276
好啦，我知道了! 我知道了! 我没事 
Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm alright.

1171
01:24:54,252 --> 01:24:55,914
什么 ? 詹姆斯要追杀我 ? 
What? Now James is coming after me?

1172
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:08,064
听我说，詹姆斯是个追踪者 
Listen to me, James is a tracker.

1174
01:25:10,357 --> 01:25:12,232
我在场地的反应刺激了他 
My reaction at the field set him off.

1175
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:15,511
我让他觉得这是他生平最刺激的游戏 
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1176
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,165
他不会就此罢手的 
He's never gonna stop.

1177
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,685
我们该怎么办 ? 
What should we do?

1178
01:25:17,984 --> 01:25:18,485
我们必须杀了他 
We have to kill him.

1179
01:25:18,486 --> 01:25:20,483
把他撕成一片片的，然后烧掉 
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1180
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:21,963
我们要去哪？ 
Where are we going?

1181
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:23,035
离开福克斯 
Away from Forks.

1182
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:24,563
我们搭渡轮去温哥华 
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.

1184
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:28,048
你不能回家 
You can't go home.

1185
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,033
他会从那里追踪你的气味 
He's just gonna trace your scent there.

1186
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,693
那里将是他观察的首要地点 
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1187
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:33,487
但我爸爸在那 
But my dad is there.

1188
01:25:33,522 --> 01:25:34,413
那不重要！ 
It doesn't matter!

1189
01:25:34,414 --> 01:25:38,005
不，那有关系的！他可能会因为我们而死 
Yes, it does!He could get killed because of us.

1190
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:40,932
让我先带你离开这里，好吗 ? 
Just let me get you out of here first, alright?

1191
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:42,393
那是我爸爸!我们必须回去 
It's my dad! We have to go back.

1192
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:44,691
我们得想办法引开他 
We'll figure how to lead the tracker

1195
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:54,821
爱德华，我说了别管我！ 
Edward, I said leave me alone!

1196
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,113
贝拉，别这样，拜托... 
Bella, don't do this, please...

1198
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:59,228
嘿...嘿 ! 嘿 ! 
Hey...Hey! hey!

1199
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:01,027
贝拉，怎么回事 ? 
Bella, what's going on?

1200
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:03,370
我要离开这里 
I just gotta get out of here.

1201
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:04,631
现在就走！ 
I'm leaving..Now!

1202
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,171
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1203
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,944
我要怎么对他说 ? 
What am I gonna say to him?

1204
01:26:15,362 --> 01:26:16,859
我不能伤害他 
I can't hurt him.

1205
01:26:17,562 --> 01:26:18,657
贝拉，发生什么事了 ? 
Bella, what's going on?

1206
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:19,789
你必须这么做 
You'll just have to.

1207
01:26:21,077 --> 01:26:22,359
我在卡车里等你 
I'll be down at the truck.

1208
01:26:28,457 --> 01:26:29,826
他伤害了你？ 
Did he hurt you?

1209
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:31,581
不 
No

1210
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,222
和你分手还是什么？ 
Break up with you or something?

1211
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,532
不，我...是我甩了他 
No, I... I broke up with him.

1212
01:26:40,981 --> 01:26:42,691
我以为你喜欢他 
I thought you liked him.

1213
01:26:45,475 --> 01:26:47,392
对，这就是为什么我要走 
Yeah, that's just why I have to leave.

1214
01:26:47,393 --> 01:26:49,945
我不想这样，我要回家 
I don't want this, I have to go home.

1215
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:55,052
家？你妈妈甚至不在凤凰城 
Home ? Your mom is not even in Phoenix.

1216
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,785
我在路上会打给她 
I'll call her from the road.

1217
01:26:57,886 --> 01:26:59,814
你没必要现在开车回去 
You don't have to drive home right now.

1218
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:02,035
你可以先去睡觉 
You can sleep on it.

1219
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:04,434
如果明早你还想走，我可以带你去机场 
If you still feel like going in the morning, I'll take you to the airport.

1220
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:07,492
不，我想开车走，这样比较有时间思考 
No, I want to drive, it will give more time to think.

1221
01:27:07,593 --> 01:27:11,274
你放心，如果我真的累了，我会找个旅馆 我保证 
If I get really tired, I'll pull into a motel.I promise.

1222
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:13,896
呃，贝拉，我知道跟我相处很无趣 
Look, Bella.I know I'm not that much fun to be around.

1223
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,265
但是我可以改的 
But I can change that.

1224
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:19,030
我们可以一起做很多事情的 
We can do more stuff together.

1225
01:27:21,568 --> 01:27:25,079
例如？整天盯着电视看棒球比赛？ 
Like what ? Like watch baseball on the flatscreen?

1226
01:27:26,003 --> 01:27:27,992
每晚一起吃晚饭？牛排和馅饼？ 
Eat at the dinner every night?Steak and Cobbler?

1228
01:27:34,408 --> 01:27:37,708
贝拉，别这样，我只是...想让你留下 
Bella, come on. I just... got you back.

1229
01:27:41,337 --> 01:27:43,148
是啊，你知道...如果我现在不走 我就会像妈一样永远陷在这里
Yeah, you know... If I don't get out now,I'm just gonna be just stuck here like mom.

1231
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,381
你爸爸会原谅你的 
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1232
01:28:15,022 --> 01:28:16,958
让我来开吧 ? 
Why don't you let me drive?

1233
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:24,081
他不会的 
He won't.

1234
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:27,181
你没看到他的表情 
You should have seen his face.

1237
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:35,281
那是唯一能让你走的方法 
It was the only way he'd let you go.

1238
01:28:37,663 --> 01:28:40,479
现在先别担心他了，他很安全 
Just don't worry about him now.He's safe.

1239
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:41,709
追踪者正在跟着我们 
The tracker's following us.

1240
01:28:46,172 --> 01:28:47,201
那是艾密特 
It's just Emmett.

1241
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:51,350
艾莉丝的车跟在后面 
Alice is in the car behind us.

1242
01:29:13,785 --> 01:29:14,710
等一下 ! 
Wait!

1243
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,563
他是来警告我们关于詹姆斯的事 
He came to warn us About James.

1244
01:29:18,784 --> 01:29:19,995
这不是我引起的战争 
This isn't my fight

1245
01:29:19,996 --> 01:29:22,563
而且我早已厌倦他的游戏了 
And I've grown tired of his games.

1246
01:29:22,773 --> 01:29:25,579
但他拥有空前的感官能力，绝对是致命性的 
But he's got unparalleled senses, absolutely lethal.

1247
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,356
三百年来，我从没见过像他那么厉害的 
I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years.

1248
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:32,723
还有那个女的，维多莉亚...绝不要低估了她 
And the woman, Victoria...Don't underestimate her.

1249
01:29:37,534 --> 01:29:39,788
我以前被迫与同类作战过，很难杀的死对方 
I've had to fight our kind before.We're not easy to kill.

1250
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:40,931
但并不是不可能 
But not impossible.

1251
01:29:42,058 --> 01:29:44,174
我们会把他撕成一片片然后烧了 
We'll rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1252
01:29:44,275 --> 01:29:46,366
我并不喜好杀死另一种同类 
I don't relish the thought of killing another creature.

1254
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:50,809
要是他先杀了我们其中一个呢？ 
What if he kills one of us first?

1255
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:53,566
我会带贝拉逃到南方，把追踪者引开这里 
I'm gonna run Bella south and then lead the tracker away from here.

1256
01:29:53,567 --> 01:29:55,816
不，爱德华，詹姆斯知道你不可能离开贝拉 
No, Edward. James knows you'd never leave Bella.

1257
01:29:55,817 --> 01:29:56,846
他会跟踪你的 
He'll follow you.

1258
01:29:56,864 --> 01:29:59,784
我和贝拉一起走，贾斯柏和我开车带她南下 
I'll go with Bella.Jasper and I will drive her south.

1259
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,474
我会保护她的，爱德华 
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1260
01:30:01,545 --> 01:30:03,237
你们控制得住自己吗 ? 
Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?

1261
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:04,134
是的 
Yes.

1262
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:10,566
罗丝莉...艾丝蜜 
Rosalie... Esme.

1265
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,555
为什么？她和我是什么关系？ 
Why? What is she to me?

1266
01:30:19,777 --> 01:30:21,035
罗丝莉 
Rosalie.

1267
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:23,235
贝拉与爱德华现在是情侣 
Bella is with Edward.

1268
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:25,235
她现在是我们家族的一份子 
She is part of this family now.

1269
01:30:26,652 --> 01:30:28,876
而我们永远会保护家人 
And we protect our family.

1270
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:52,097
如果发生了什么意外，我发誓... 
If anything happens, I swear to God...

1271
01:30:52,098 --> 01:30:53,240
不会有事的 
Nothing's gonna happen.

1272
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:55,840
我们是七个对付他们两个呢 
There's seven of us against two of them.

1273
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:57,262
而且等事情结束后 我就会去接你的 
And when everything's done I'm gonna come back and get you.

1275
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:01,765
好的 
Yeah.

1276
01:31:02,655 --> 01:31:05,276
贝拉，从现在起你就是我的生命了 
Bella, you are my life now.

1277
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,198
嘿，妈妈，又是我 
Hey, mom. It's me again.

1279
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:30,904
我现在不在福克斯，但我没事，过后再跟你解释 
I'm not in Forks but everything's okay and I'll explain it later.

1280
01:31:37,717 --> 01:31:39,975
罗丝，在树群中作标记 
Rose, among the three.

1281
01:31:41,885 --> 01:31:43,314
很好 
That's good.

1282
01:32:30,814 --> 01:32:32,807
怎么了 ? 你看见什么 ? 
What is it? What did you see?

1283
01:32:44,524 --> 01:32:46,295
被他识破了 
He figured it out.

1284
01:32:46,296 --> 01:32:49,413
追踪者，他改变路线了 
The tracker. He just changed course.

1285
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:52,246
他往哪个方向了，艾莉丝 ? 
Where will it take him, Alice?

1286
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:54,458
镜子...一个全是镜子的房间 
Mirrors...A room full of mirrors.

1287
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,297
艾德华说你看到的不一定是正确的 
Edward said the visions weren't always certain.

1288
01:33:01,398 --> 01:33:04,780
她看到的过程必须是那个人刚好在那里 
She sees the course people are on while they're on it.

1289
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,674
如果他们改变主意了，看到的也会变 
If they change their minds, the vision changes.

1290
01:33:06,675 --> 01:33:09,374
那么，追踪者现在的路线... 
So, the course that the tracker's on now is gonna...

1292
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,731
你去过？ 
You've been here?

1293
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:16,080
我小时候在那上过课 
I took lessons as a kid.

1294
01:33:16,355 --> 01:33:18,291
我去的学校有个这样的拱门 
The school I went to had an arch just like that.

1295
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,490
你的学校也在凤凰城 ? 
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1296
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:20,830
是的 
Yeah.

1297
01:33:22,452 --> 01:33:23,271
艾德华，你没事吧 ? 
Edward, you okay?

1299
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:28,842
罗丝莉和艾丝蜜回到福克斯去保护你爸爸 
Rosalie and Esme have gone back to Forks to protect your father.

1300
01:33:28,843 --> 01:33:30,006
我马上过去找你 
I'm coming to get you.

1301
01:33:30,007 --> 01:33:33,290
然后我们一起去别的地方.
Then you and I are gonna go somewhere.

1303
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,398
其它人会继续追捕他 
And the others will keep hunting.

1304
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,544
我会不惜一切代价保护你的安全 
I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe.

1305
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:53,675
嘿，妈！我很高兴你收到我的信息了 
Hey, mom! I'm glad you got my message.

1306
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:55,143
你在家做什么？ 
What are you doing home?

1307
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:57,985
贝拉 ! 贝拉! 贝拉 ? 你在哪儿 ? 
Bella! Bella! Bella? Where are you?

1308
01:33:58,619 --> 01:34:00,422
冷静点，没事的 
Calm down, everything's fine.

1309
01:34:00,562 --> 01:34:01,462
贝拉 ! 
Bella!

1310
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:05,363
我晚点再跟你解释...妈，你还好吗 ? 
I'll explain everything later...Mom, are you alright?

1313
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,791
让维多利亚很简单的就找到了你以前的地址 
It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.

1315
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:15,905
你住过的房子还不错 
It's a nice house you have here.

1316
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:18,260
我本来就打算好在这等你来的 
I was prepared to wait for you.

1317
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:20,864
但是当你妈妈接到一通你爸焦急的电话后就回家来了 
But then mom came home after she received a very worried call from your dad.

1319
01:34:23,142 --> 01:34:26,047
一切都进展的相当顺利 
It all worked out quite well.

1320
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,164
等等 
Wait

1322
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,382
你还有机会救她的 
You can still save her.

1323
01:34:31,894 --> 01:34:34,343
但是你必须离开你的朋友们 
But you're gonna have to get away from your friends.

1324
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:35,765
你能做到吗？ 
Can you handle that?

1325
01:34:36,246 --> 01:34:37,544
我去哪里见你 ? 
Where should I meet you?

1326
01:34:39,796 --> 01:34:42,081
你以前的芭蕾教室如何 ? 
How about your old ballet studio?

1329
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,978
我从来都没想过我会怎么死 
I'd never given much thought to how I would die

1330
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,087
但为自己所爱的人而死似乎是个不错的选择 
But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.

1332
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,274
我不会因为这个让我自己面对死亡的决定而感到后悔  
I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with dead.

1336
01:36:03,362 --> 01:36:04,562
妈妈 
Mom

1337
01:36:04,563 --> 01:36:05,662
贝拉?  妈！  
Bella?  Mom!

1338
01:36:05,663 --> 01:36:07,729
你在这里做什么 ? 
What are you doing in here?

1339
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:09,310
每个人都取笑我 
Everyone makes fun of me.

1340
01:36:10,662 --> 01:36:12,953
你是个很棒的舞者 
You are a wonderful dancer.

1341
01:36:13,154 --> 01:36:15,756
妈妈，我糟透了 
Mom, I suck!

1342
01:36:16,262 --> 01:36:19,262
你一点都不糟糕 
You do not suck.

1343
01:36:28,362 --> 01:36:30,322
这段是我最喜欢的部分 
That's my favorite part.

1344
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:33,618
你是个固执的孩子，不是吗？ 
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?

1345
01:36:35,817 --> 01:36:37,521
她根本不在这里 
She's not even here

1347
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:49,468
所以...为了有更多的娱乐效果 我们来拍一点我们在一起的影片
so... To make things more entertaining,we are gonna make a little film of our time together.

1349
01:36:54,051 --> 01:36:57,390
我从你家里带来这个，希望你别介意 
I borrowed this from your house.I hope you don't mind.

1350
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:58,432
好的... 
Okay...

1351
01:36:58,656 --> 01:37:03,218
然后 ....开始 ! 
And...Action!

1352
01:37:05,378 --> 01:37:07,148
这会让艾德华心碎的 
That will break Edward's little heart.

1353
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:09,996
艾德华跟这事无关 ! 
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1355
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:16,256
他的愤怒会让这场游戏更加有趣.
His rage will leave for more interesting sporthings.

1357
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:21,241
我们继续吧 
And let's continue.

1358
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:40,730
真美...非常有视觉动感 
Beautiful... Very visually dynamic.

1359
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:44,853
我真是选对了舞台 
I chose my stage well.

1360
01:37:50,029 --> 01:37:52,769
他没勇气改造你真是太糟糕了 
It's too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.

1362
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,255
这可真是残忍 
It's cruel, really.

1363
01:38:03,103 --> 01:38:04,987
跟他说为你报仇吧 
Tell him to avenge you.

1364
01:38:05,999 --> 01:38:07,781
告诉他为你报仇！说！ 
Tell him to avenge you! Tell him!

1365
01:38:07,782 --> 01:38:08,730
艾德华，不要 ! 
Edward, don't!

1366
01:38:09,262 --> 01:38:09,962
告诉他！ 
Tell him!

1367
01:38:23,202 --> 01:38:26,683
你落单了...因为你比其它人都快 
You're alone...cause you're faster than the others.

1369
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:34,221
我强到能杀了你 
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1370
01:38:41,286 --> 01:38:42,474
很抱歉 
I'm sorry.

1371
01:39:46,059 --> 01:39:47,862
贝拉，贝拉 ! 没事了 
Bella, Bella! It's okay.

1373
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:52,505
够了！别失去了你的本性 
Enough! Remember who you are.

1374
01:39:58,893 --> 01:40:00,784
贝拉需要你 
Bella needs you.

1375
01:40:03,067 --> 01:40:04,277
哦，天啊 
Oh God.

1376
01:40:08,151 --> 01:40:10,121
卡莱尔 ! 这血... 
Carlisle! The blood...

1377
01:40:10,122 --> 01:40:11,683
你的兄弟们会解决他的 
Your brothers will take care of it.

1378
01:40:12,342 --> 01:40:14,115
用地上的木板生火 
Start the fire with the floor boards.

1379
01:40:16,169 --> 01:40:17,100
艾莉丝 ! 
Alice!

1380
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:18,218
艾莉丝，快 
Alice, go.

1382
01:40:30,392 --> 01:40:32,245
不，不，我的手...烧起来了! 
No, no, my hand... Is burning!

1383
01:40:33,805 --> 01:40:35,298
那是毒液的关系 
It's the venom.

1384
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:39,135
为了不让她转化，你必须做个选择 
You have to make a choice to prevent the change happen.

1385
01:40:39,962 --> 01:40:42,514
不... 
No...

1386
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:43,284
不！ 
No!

1387
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,006
这会发生的，艾德华，我预见到了 
It's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.

1388
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:48,814
不一定非要这样做 
It doesn't have to be that way.

1389
01:40:48,815 --> 01:40:50,095
她还在出血..，艾莉丝 
She's still hemorrhaging...Alice

1390
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:51,863
把你的皮带给我当止血带 
Make me a tourniquet with your belt.

1391
01:40:51,864 --> 01:40:54,529
卡莱尔，我还有其它选择吗 ? 
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1392
01:40:55,205 --> 01:40:56,747
把它绑在我的手上 
Tie it above my hands.

1393
01:40:57,278 --> 01:40:58,985
卡莱尔 ! 
Carlisle!

1394
01:41:00,612 --> 01:41:02,219
快 
Go.

1395
01:41:06,816 --> 01:41:08,170
试着把毒液吸出来 
To try to suck the venom out.

1396
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:09,584
你知道我可能没办法停下来的 
You know I won't be able to stop.

1397
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,772
那就用你的意志力...去阻止 
Then find the will...To stop.

1398
01:41:12,536 --> 01:41:15,621
她没几分钟可活了 
She only has minutes left.

1399
01:41:18,362 --> 01:41:20,431
我不会让你离开我的，贝拉 
I can't make you go away, Bella.

1400
01:41:22,962 --> 01:41:25,129
但我会让痛苦离开你的 
But I'll make it go away.

1401
01:41:43,321 --> 01:41:44,823
艾德华，停下来 ! 
Edward, stop!

1402
01:41:44,824 --> 01:41:47,215
血已经干净了，再下去你会杀死她的 
The blood is clean, you're killing her.

1403
01:41:48,048 --> 01:41:51,154
爱德华，停下来 ! 
Edward, stop!

1404
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:55,938
快停下来，意志力要坚定 
Stop. Find the will.

1405
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:24,259
死亡是那么安详... 简单... 
Dead is peaceful... Easy...

1406
01:42:31,462 --> 01:42:33,011
活着却是如此困难 
Life is harder.

1407
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:40,067
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1408
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:43,462
宝贝？ 
Baby?

1409
01:42:45,162 --> 01:42:46,362
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1410
01:42:47,462 --> 01:42:48,462
妈妈...
Mom...

1411
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:50,162
嘿...
Hey...

1412
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:54,837
他在哪里 ? 在哪...爱德华在哪儿 ? 
Where is he? Where's... Where is Edward?

1413
01:42:54,838 --> 01:42:56,486
他睡着了 
He's asleep.

1414
01:42:57,741 --> 01:42:59,308
他一直没离开过 
He never leaves.

1415
01:42:59,309 --> 01:43:01,498
而你爸爸在楼下的餐厅 
And your dad is down at the cafeteria.

1416
01:43:02,837 --> 01:43:04,940
发生了甚么事 ? 
What happened?

1417
01:43:04,941 --> 01:43:07,226
呃，你跌倒的时候，摔断了腿 
Well, when you fell you broke your leg.

1419
01:43:11,515 --> 01:43:13,579
你一点都不记得了吗？ 
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1420
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,713
艾德华和他父亲 试着要劝你回去福克斯 
Edward came down with his dad to try to convince to come back to Forks.

1422
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:22,714
所以你去他们饭店时，就这么滑倒了... 摔下两段楼梯 
So you went over to their hotel and you tripped...and fell down two flights of stairs.

1425
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,641
是的，那听起来蛮像我的 
Yeah, it sounds like me.

1426
01:43:36,642 --> 01:43:39,207
哦，亲爱的，我很抱歉 
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

1427
01:43:43,058 --> 01:43:43,969
是费尔 
It's Phil.

1428
01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:46,774
他很担心你 
He's so worried about you.

1429
01:43:48,674 --> 01:43:49,989
你会发简讯了? 
You're texting?

1430
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,978
是啊，终于会了 
Finally, yeah.

1431
01:43:53,244 --> 01:43:55,350
我要他留在佛罗里达 
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1432
01:43:55,351 --> 01:43:57,741
哦，亲爱的，你会喜欢杰克逊维尔州的 
Oh, honey. You are gonna love Jacksonville.

1433
01:43:57,751 --> 01:43:59,531
那里每天都阳光明媚 
It's sunny everyday day.

1434
01:44:00,009 --> 01:44:01,553
而且我们找到了一间很可爱的房子 
And we found the cutest little house

1436
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:05,065
不，妈妈，我还是想住在福克斯镇 
No, Mom. I still wanna live in Forks.

1437
01:44:06,151 --> 01:44:07,199
什么？ 
What?

1438
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:09,224
我想住在福克斯 
I wanna live in Forks.

1439
01:44:09,825 --> 01:44:13,289
呃，好吧，我们再说吧 
Well, okay. We'll talk about it.

1440
01:44:13,405 --> 01:44:15,880
你介意去找一下爸爸吗？ 
Do you mind getting dad?

1441
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,097
我有话要跟他说，跟他道歉 
I have to talk to him. Apologize.

1442
01:44:20,358 --> 01:44:22,874
好的，宝贝，我去叫他 
Okay, baby.I'll go get him.

1443
01:44:23,262 --> 01:44:25,532
我也会找护士过来的，好吗 ? 
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?

1444
01:44:25,567 --> 01:44:26,571
好的 
Okay.

1445
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:41,665
发生了什么事 ? 詹姆斯哪里去了 ? 
What happened? Where is James?

1448
01:44:54,523 --> 01:44:56,368
都是因为你我才能活着 
I'm alive because of you.

1449
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:59,748
不，你是因为我才沦落成这样的 
No, you're in here because of me.

1450
01:45:00,673 --> 01:45:04,330
最糟糕的是... 我以为我没办法停止
The worst part of it was...I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1452
01:45:07,331 --> 01:45:08,692
可是你停下来了 
You did stop.

1453
01:45:10,113 --> 01:45:12,850
贝拉，你应该去杰克森维尔的 这样我就不会再伤害你了 
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville,so I can't hurt you anymore.

1455
01:45:16,504 --> 01:45:17,816
什么？

1456
01:45:21,862 --> 01:45:24,366

01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:50,800
好了，你不准再对我说那种话了 
Okay. You just can't just say stuff like that to me.

1466
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:59,313
哪里还有...我的容身之处呢？ 
Where else...am I gonna go?

1467
01:46:47,393 --> 01:46:49,597
艾莉丝借给我的礼服 
Alice lent me the dress.

1470
01:46:56,849 --> 01:46:59,082
我会照顾她的，史旺警长

1471
01:47:00,163 --> 01:47:02,384
呃，这句话好像有听你说过

1472
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:08,836
嘿，贝拉 
Hey, Bells.

你是来舞会捣乱的？

1485
01:47:48,315 --> 01:47:50,214
还是和舞伴一起来的？ 
Did you come with a date?

1486
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,329
不 
No.

1487

我爸付钱让我来跟你说话

说来听听

01:48:03,122 --> 01:48:04,613
先别生气，好吗？ 
Just don't get mad, okay?

1491
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:09,266
他希望你跟男朋友分手

1497

喔，让我帮你吧

1498
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:25,162

我会常来看你的，贝拉 
I guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1501
01:48:43,947 --> 01:48:47,843
我只离开你两分钟，狼人就趁虚而入了 
I leave you alone for two minutes and the wolves descend.

1503
01:48:56,951 --> 01:48:58,271
笑一个

1504
01:49:18,508 --> 01:49:20,839
哇喔 ! 你还真想害死我呢 
Wow! You are really trying to kill me.

1505
01:49:21,256 --> 01:49:23,055
舞会是进行的一个重要仪式

1507
01:49:53,662 --> 01:49:54,862
贝拉!

01:49:58,362 --> 01:49:59,895

跳舞吗？ 
Shall we?

1512
01:50:11,525 --> 01:50:13,056
你是说真的吗 
You're serious?

1513
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:15,987
哦，有何不可呢？ 
Oh, why not?

1514
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:33,414
瞧？你正在跳舞呢 
See? You're dancing.

1515
01:50:35,062 --> 01:50:36,483
在舞会上... 
At Prom...

1516
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:59,133
爱德华，你为什么救我 ? 
Edward, why did you save me?

1517
01:50:59,662 --> 01:51:01,948
假如当时你让毒液扩散...现在我就和你一样了
