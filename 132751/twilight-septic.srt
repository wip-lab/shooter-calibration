1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,747
我从未认真想过我会如何死去 
I'd never given much thought to how I would die.

2
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,174
如果能代替自己所爱的人而死 
But dying in the place of someone I love

3
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,077
似乎也是个不错的抉择 
Seems like a good way to go.

4
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,592
所以我并不后悔当初离开家的决定 
So, I can't bring myself to regret the decision to leave home.

5
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,693
我会想念凤凰城的 
I would miss Phoenix,

6
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:22,336
我会想念那里的炎热 
I'd miss the heat,

7
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:29,547
也会想念我挚爱的那个粗心大意、稳定性奇差的母亲 
I would miss my loving, erratic, harebrained mother

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,618
和她的新丈夫 
And her new husband.

9
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,127
来，快点！我爱你们，但我们还得去赶飞机 
Guys, come on! - I love you both, we got a plain to catch.

10
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,146
但他们即将去巡回比赛 
But they wanna go on the road,

11
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,846
而我必须去跟父亲住一阵子了 
So I'm gonna spend some time with my dad

12
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,811
这应该是件好事 
And this will be a good thing

13
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:45,435
我是这么想的 
I think.

14
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,005


15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000


16
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,850
<font color="ffff88" > ＝ 片名：暮 光 之 城 - 无惧的爱 ＝ </font>

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
在华盛顿州里 
In the state of Washington,

18
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,163
有一个常年拢罩着乌云和雨的地方 
Under a near constant cover of clouds and rain,

19
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,300
一个名为福克斯的小镇 
There's a small town named Forks.

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,219
人口数只有 3,120人 
Population: 3120 people.

21
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:26,973
那正是我要搬去的地方 
This is where I'm moving

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,171
我的父亲 - 查理 
My dad's Charlie.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,805
他是这里的警长 
He's the Chief of Police.

24
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,539
的头发变长了 
Your hair's longer.

25
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:50,617
上次见你之后，我剪过了 
I cut since last time I saw you.

26
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,849
我猜它大概长得挺快的吧 
I guess it grew a lot again.

27
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,991
每年夏天，我都会来这里住两个礼拜左右 
I used to spend two weeks here almost every summer,

28
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,581
但那已经是多年前的事了.. 
But it's been years...

29
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,205
我把浴室的架子清理干净了 
I cleared some shelves up in the bathroom.

30
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,071
哦，好的 
Oh, right

31
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,037
只有一间浴室 
One bathroom.

32
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,411
蛮实用的工作台灯 
It's a pretty good work lamp.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
席尔斯的销售小姐帮我选的床组 
The Sears lady picked up the bed stuff.

34
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,866
你喜欢紫色，对吧？ 
You like purple, right?

35
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,824
紫色很正点 
Purple's cool.

36
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,785
谢谢 
Thanks.

37
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,353
好了 
Okay.

38
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,965
查理最大的优点之一就是... 
One of the best things about Charlie...

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,341
他不会嗦 
He doesn't hover.

40
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,193
我听说你们一路赶过来 
I heard you guys coming all the way down the road.

41
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,700
很高兴见到你 
Good to see you.

42
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,329
贝拉，还记得比利．布雷克吗？ 
Bella, you remember Billy Black?

43
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,042
记得 
Yeah.

44
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,001
你气色看来不错 
You're looking good.

45
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,870
我还有持续在练舞呢 
I'm still dancing.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,543
我很高兴你终于来了 
I'm glad you are finally here.

47
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:29,286
听说要来，查理就一直说个不停 
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,296
好啦，少在那夸张了，小心我拖你去喂泥巴 
Alright, keep exaggerating,I'll roll you into the mud

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,700
你敢我就辗你的脚丫子 
Until I ram you in the ankles.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,660
好，来啊！ 
Yeah, bring it!

51
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:39,958
嗨，我是雅各布 
Hi, I'm Jacob.

52
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:43,900
我们小时候经常一起玩泥巴作成派 
We used to make mud pies when we were little.

53
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,384
对，我还记得 
Right, I remember.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,091
他们经常这样闹吗？ 
Are they always like this?

55
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,155
越老越严重 
It's getting worse with old age.

56
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,604
所以，觉得如何？ 
So, what do you think?

57
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:55,951
什么？ 
What?

58
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,188
回家的礼物 
Your homecoming present.

59
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,062
这个吗？ 
This?

60
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:01,700
刚向比利买来的 
Just bought it off Billy, here.

61
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,690
没错 
Yep.

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,120
我帮重新整修了引擎 
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.

63
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,446
喔，老天 
Oh God

64
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,243
不会吧，哦，我的～天啊！ 
Come on.Oh My ～Gosh!

65
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:10,080
这真是太棒了！ 
This is perfect!

66
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,065
这不是开玩笑吧 ! 
You must be joking!

67
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:11,811
抱歉 
Sorry.

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,490
我就说她会喜欢的 
I told you she'd love it.

69
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,586
我最懂得怎么安抚小孩子了 
I'm down with the kids.

70
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,876
是阿，老兄，你就是个爱吹嘘的家伙 
Oh, yeah dude. You're the bomb.

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,600
好吧 
Okay,

72
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,041
换挡的时候要踩两下离合器 
You gotta double pump the clutch when you shift but...

73
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,998
除了这个，应该没甚么问题的 
Besides that, you should be good.

74
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,151
是这个吗？ 
That's this one?

75
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:29,300
对，就是那个 
Yeah, right there.

76
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,250
好的 
Alright.

77
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,995
你要搭便车去学校吗 ? 
You want a ride to school or something?

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,675
我上的是印地安人保留区里的学校 
I go to school on the reservation.

79
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,132
哦，好吧 
Oh, right.

80
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,650
太糟了，我好不容易才有个认识的人 
That's too bad. It would've been good to know one person.

81
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,429
我到新学校的第一天 
My first day in a new school.

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,899
那是三月，正好是学期中 
It's March, the middle of the semester.

83
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:54,537
好极了 
Great.

84
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,446
车不错 
Nice ride.

85
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:03,713
谢谢 
Thanks.

86
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,087
是伊莎贝拉?史旺，新来的女生 
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.

87
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,989
嗨 ! 我叫艾瑞克，我是本地的万事通 
Hi! I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.

88
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,114
需要什么协助吗？导游、餐饮伙伴.. 
Anything you need? Tour guide,lunch date...

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,950
还是诉苦的对象？ 
A shoulder to cry on.

90
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,736
我是个能默默承受兼内向型的人 
I'm really kind of a more suffer in silence' type

91
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:34,000
这可以作成一个专访喔 
Good headline for your feature.

92
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:36,005
我是校刊社的，而是本校的新闻了，宝贝 
I'm on the paper and you're news baby,

93
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,002
上头版头条

94
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:38,555
喔，我不是.. 
Oh,I am not..

95
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,533
拜托别这样... 
Please don't...

96
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,934
喔喔 ! 别紧张啦 
Whoa! Relax.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,572
就取消专访吧 
No feature.

98
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,843
好....谢了 
Okay..thanks.

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,453
对不起 
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:01,673
我本来就不该答应玩球的 
I told them not to let me play.

101
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:04,300
不，不是...那是... 
No, no...That's...

102
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,953
是伊莎贝拉，对吧 ? 
You're Isabella, right?

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,027
叫我贝拉 
Just Bella.

104

是啦，嗨，我是麦克...纽顿 
Yeah, hey! I'm Mike... Newton.

105
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,359
很高兴见到你 Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,364
她让你碰了个大钉子，哈 ?! 
She's got a great spike, huh?

107
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,313
顺便说一下，我叫洁西卡 
I'm Jessica, by the way.

108
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,521
嘿，从亚利桑那州来的对吧？ 
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?

109
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,301
对 
Yeah.

110
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:24,374
亚利桑那州的人不都是..小麦肤色吗？ 
Aren't people from Arizona supposed to be like..really tan?

111
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,501
是啊，这大概就是我被他们踢出来的原因吧 
Yeah, maybe that's why they kicked me out.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,180
好样的 
You're good.

113
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:35,740
很有趣 
That's so funny

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,001
在这一个片段中 .... ..
A Master Piece.

115
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,438
我们可以让像是金字塔从天上掉下来一样 
We're gonna have like this crazy pyramid fall from the sky.

116
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,809
嗨，麦克，见见我邻家的女孩，贝拉 
Hey Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella.

117
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,434
喔，你的邻家女孩？ 
Oh, your home girl?

118
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,260
对啊 
Yeah.

119
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,000
我的女孩 
My girl

120
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,797
泰勒 
Tyler.

121
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,405
喔，天哪 
Oh my God,

122
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,675
真像是又回到一年级的幼稚模样 
it's like first grade all over again.

123
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,676
就像是最闪亮的新玩具 
You're the shiny new toy.

124
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,263
笑一个！ 
Smile!

125
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:11,866
好... 
Okay...

126
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,790
抱歉，我的专访需要一个照片 
Sorry, I needed the candid for the feature.

127
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,643
的专访早就没了，安杰拉，别再提了 
Feature's dead, Angela.Don't bring it up again.

128
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,000
好吧，我只是.. 
It's okay, I just...

129
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,105
我挺，宝贝 
I got your back, baby.

130
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,469
我想将讨论的方向转为青少年酗酒 
I guess we'll just turn another editorial on teen drinking.

131
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,879
其实可以讨论.. 
You can always go for...

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,647
像是暴饮暴食... 
The eating disorders...

133
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,896
游泳队的竞速计划 .... 
Speedo padding on the swim team...

134
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:33,519
说真的，这个点子不错 
Actually, that's a good one.

135
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,133
是啊，对，我就是这么想的 
Yeah, right. That's exactly what I thought.

136
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,053
我们是在讨论奥林匹克的规格了 
We're talking Olympic size.

137
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:41,000
那是不可能的，他太瘦了，太不协调了 
There's no way, he's so skinny.It doesn't make sense.

138
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:41,800
绝对 
Totally

139
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:46,469
他们是谁？ 
Who are they?

140
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,885
库伦家族 
The Cullens.

141
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,966
他们..呃... 
They're, um...

142
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,801
库伦医生夫妇领养的孩子 
Dr. and Mrs. Cullen foster kids.

143
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:57,007
几年前他们从阿拉斯加搬来这儿 
They moved down here from Alaska a few years ago.

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,716
他们只和自己人相处 
They kind of keep to themselves.

145
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,129
对，因为他们都同进同出 
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

146
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,516
就像是双双对对 
Like together together.

147
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,755
那个金发的叫罗丝莉 
The blond girl, that's Rosalie,

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,144
而那个大个子的黑发男生是艾密特 
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.

149
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,618
看起来还真像是情侣 
They're like a thing.

150
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,061
我有点怀疑是不是亲兄妹 
I'm not even sure that's legal.

151
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,784
洁西，他们没有血缘关系 
Jess, they're not actually related.

152
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,246
对啊，但他们竟然住一起，这太怪了 
Yeah, but they live together...It's weird.

153
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,099
然后 ... 
And... OK..

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,000
那个身材娇小的黑发女生叫艾莉丝 
The little dark-haired girl is Alice.

155
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,793
她才真诡异呢 
She's really weird.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,534
还有..她与贾斯柏是一对，金发的那个 
And...She's with Jasper, the blonde one,

157
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,234
他看起来好像生病似的

158
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:38,426
库伦医生就像个婚姻中介所的养父 
Dr.Cullen is like this foster dad-slash-match maker.

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,446
也许他会收养我

160
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,118
这又是谁 ? 
Who's he?

00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,657
他是..爱德华库伦 
That's..Edward Cullen.

162

很明显的，他倒是挺迷人的 
He's totally gorgeous, obviously.

163
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,814
但更明显的是，这儿还找不到能与他匹配的人 
But apparently nobody here is good enough for him.

164
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,888
我才不在乎呢，懂吧 
Like I care... You know.

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,245
所以... 呃 .... 
So...Yeah...

166
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,384
说真的，可别浪费时间去.. 
Seriously, don't waste your time...

167
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,235
我才没那个兴趣 
I wasn't planning on it.

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,246

还有...我帮你安排了个位子 
And...I got a seat for you right here

174
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:49,098
是在最后一个..所以..

物理？生物化学？ 
Physics? Biochem?

180
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,556
每个课程人数都额满了，亲爱的 
Every class is full, my dear.

181
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,306

182
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:45,329
恐怕你只能继续上生物课了 
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in Biology.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
好吧，我只能...试着去忍受了 
Fine, I'll just...accept to endure it.

184
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,383
我只是还不能习惯你已经长这么大了 
I just can't get over how grown up you are.

185
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:09,921
而且还这么漂亮

有一年我扮圣诞老人..

是阿，维隆，她四岁以后就没在这里过圣诞节了 
Yeah, Waylon.She hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.

190
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,316
我打赌我给留下印象了，不是吗？ 
I bet I made an impression, didn't I?

191
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,687

都很重要，亲爱的 Yes it does, honey!

218
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,337

事情似乎变得有点... And things were getting a little...

230
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,151
怪怪的 Strange.

231
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,500
你没事吧？ Are you alright?

232
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,368
是，我没事 Yeah, I'm good.

233
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,404
地上结冰后就无法止滑 Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

234
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:41,006
对啊，所以我帮的卡车换上新轮胎了 Yeah,that's why I had some new tires put on the truck.

235
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,561
旧的轮胎表面已经磨平了 The old ones were getting really bold.

236
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,100
嗯， 我可能来不及回来吃晚餐了 Well, I'll probably be late for dinner.

237

我必须赶到梅森郡 Gotta head down to Mason County.

238
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:50,080
有个杰里逊面粉厂的警卫，不知道被甚么野兽咬死了 A security guard at the Grisham mill got killed by some kind of animal.

239
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,723
野兽？ An animal?

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,138
现在不是在凤凰城了，贝拉 You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.

241
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,851
总之，我打算增加人手 Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

242
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,463
小心点 Be careful.

243

你介意…我看一下吗？ You mind if I... look?

273
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,564
的确是初期 It's prophase.

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
我就说了吧 Like I said.

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,247
那么..喜欢下雨天吗? So... You're enjoying the rain?

是啊 ... Yeah...

279
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,886
我想是吧 I guess I am.

280
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,680
其实，我不太喜欢下雨 Well, I don't really like the rain.

281
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,500
或是寒冷 Any cold,

282
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,428
潮湿的.. wet thing...

283
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,300

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,375
什么？ What?

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
没事 Nothing.

286
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:40,252
这是...第三期 It's... Anaphase

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,351
介意我检查一下吗？ You mind if I check?

288

我就说了吧 Like I said.

291
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
要是你那么讨厌寒冷和下雨的话 If you hate the cold and the rain so much,

292
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:04,337
怎会想搬来全美最潮湿的地方呢？ why did you move to wettest place in the continental U.S.?

293
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,475
这说来很复杂 It's complicated.

294
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,200
我确定我有耐心听讲 I'm sure I can keep up.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,782
呃，我妈妈再婚了，而且.. Um, my mom remarried and...

296
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,500
所以你不喜欢那个男的？ So, you don't like the guy?

297
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,814
不，不是那样的..费尔人不错 No, that's not...Phil's really nice.

298
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
中期，你要检查吗？ It's Metaphase.  You wanna check it?

299
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,700
不了，我相信你 No, I believe you.

300
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,156
怎么不跟妈妈和费尔住 ? Why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?

301
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,617
呃，费尔是小联盟的棒球员 Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player.

302
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,581
他经常要巡回比赛 And he travels a lot.

303
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,500
我妈妈待在家陪我 My mom stayed home with me

304
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,700
但是我知道她不太开心，所以... But I knew it didn't make her happy so...

305
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:13,246
我想我应该和我爸住一段时间.. I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while...

306
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,300
所以现在变成不快乐了？ And now you're unhappy.

307
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,200
没有... No...

308
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,133
抱歉，我只是想试着了解 I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure you out.

309
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,500
对我来说很难看透 You're very difficult for me to read.

310
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,500
你戴隐形眼镜吗？ Hey, did you get contacts?

311
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
没有 No.

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,718
上次我看见你时，你的眼睛是黑色的，可是现在.. Your eyes were black the last time I saw you and now...

313
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,900
是金棕色了 They're like golden-brown.

314
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,565
喔，我知道，那是 .... 呃.. Yeah, I know. It's the... Um,

315
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,943
是荧光效应 it's the fluorescence.

316
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,153
贝拉，真的很抱歉 ....我吓坏了 Bella, I'm so sorry... I panicked.

317
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,729
贝拉，我已经打给 911 了 Bella! I've got 911 on the phone now.

318
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,200
贝拉 Bella,

319
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,500
没事吧？ are you okay?

320
00:21:57,969 --> 00:21:59,400
你给我好好说清楚 You and I are gonna talk.

321
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,100
你没事吧？ You alright ?

322
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:01,300
爸，我没事，冷静点 I'm fine dad, calm down.

323
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
我真的很对不起，贝拉，我煞不住车 I'm sorry Bella, I tried to stop.

324
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
我知道，没关系 I know, it's okay.

325
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:07,690
不，混蛋，我很确定那很不好 No, as sure as hell it's not okay.

326
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,250
爸，他不是故意的 Dad, it wasn't his fault.

327
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,362
差点没命了，你知道吗？ You could've been killed. You understand that?

328
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,600
是的，可是我没有，所以 .... Yes. But I wasn't, so...

329
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,162
你可以和你的驾照吻别了！ You can kiss your license goodbye.

330
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,000
我听说警长的女儿在这儿 I heard the Chief's daughter was in.

331
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,001
喔，库伦医师 Oh, Dr.Cullen.

332
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,024
查理 Charlie.

333
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,934
交给我吧，杰克 I got this one, Jackie.

334
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,200
伊莎贝拉 Isabella.

335
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
贝拉 Bella.

336
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,497
好的，贝拉，这看起来是轻微摔伤，你感觉怎样？ Well, Bella. Looks like it's a quiet spill.How do you feel?

337
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:32,291
很好 Good.

338
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,600
看这里 Look here.

339
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,300
你可能处于创伤后压力症候群 
You might experience some post-traumatic stress..

340
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:41,100
有些迷惘症状，但没伤到要害 
or disorientation but your vitals are good.

341
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,400
也没有头部外伤 
No signs of any head trauma.

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
我认为你应该没事 
I think you'll be just fine.

343
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,700
贝拉，我真的很抱歉，我实在是.. 
I'm so sorry Bella, I'm really...

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
幸好爱德华正在那里，不然我就惨了 
It would have been a lot worse if Edward wasn't there.

345
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,000
他及时把我推开了 
He knocked me out of the way.

346
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,850
爱德华？你的孩子 ? 
Edward? Your boy?

347
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,400
是的，那真是令人惊讶 
Yeah, it was amazing.

348
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:01,500
我意思是，他突然出现在我身边 
I mean, he got to me so fast.

349
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,900
他原本不是在那里的 
He was nowhere near me.

350
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,450
看来运气很好 
Sounds like you were very lucky.

351
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
查理 
Charlie

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,300
我还有些文件要处理 
I need to sign some paperwork.

353
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,200
你该给你妈打电话报个平安 
You should probably call your mom.

354
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,761
你告诉她了？ 
Did you tell her?

355
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,097
她恐怕早已....吓坏了 
She's probably just..freaking out.

356
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,259
发生了甚么事 ? 
What happened.

357
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,600
不然我该做什么？让她死吗 ? 
What was I supposed to do?Let her die?

358
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,600
这不只是你的事，这关系到我们整个家族 
This isn't just about you.It's about all of us.

359
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:35,600
我觉得我们应该到我的办公室谈.. 
I think we should talk this in my office..

360
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,700
我能和你谈谈吗？ 
Can I talk to you for a minute?

361
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,516
罗丝莉.. 
Rosalie...

362
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,851
什么事？ 
What?

363
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,813
你...你怎么能那么快就来到我身边 ? 
How...how did you get over to me so fast?

364
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,983
我当时就站在你的身边啊，贝拉 
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

365
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,191
不 
No

366
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:01,384
你是站在你的车旁边，离我很远 
you were next to your car... Across the lot.

367
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,000
不，我没有 
No, I wasn't.

368
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,398
是，你确实是这样的 
Yes, you were!

369
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:13,900
贝拉，撞到了头，我想有点精神错乱了 
Bella, you hit your head... I think you're confused.

370
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:15,851
我很清楚我看见了什么 
I know what I saw.

371
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,900
嗯..那究竟是怎么回事 ? What exactly was that?

372
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:23,446
你...你把车子挡下来了 
You...You stopped the van.

373
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:26,715
你只用一只手就把它推开了 
You pushed it..away with your hand.

374
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,638
呃，我想没有人会相信说的，所以.. 
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

375
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,691
我不会告诉任何人的 
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

376
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:37,397
我只想知道真相 
I just need to know...the truth.

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
就不能谢谢我然后忘了这件事吗？ 
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

378
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,450
谢谢你 
Thank you.

379
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,153
不能让这件事就这么过去吗 ? 
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

380
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:47,000
不能 
No

381
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,000
那好吧，我想会尽情享受失望的 
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

382
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,400
那是我第一次梦见爱德华?库伦 
That was the first night I dreamt with Edward Cullen.

383
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,900
每个人把通行证拿出来，所以… 
I need everybody's permission slips, so...

384
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:38,500
走吧 
Let's go

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,537
看看，哼 ? 
Look at you, huh?

386
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,000
还活着！ 
You're alive!

387
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,900
我知道，是啊...我猜是个假警报 
I know, Yeah... False alarm, I guess.

388
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,400
嗯，我想问，知道的.. 
Um, now I wanted to ask you, you know...

389
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,700
假如..实际上是一个月后..但... 
If... It's like a month away but...

390
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,052
想去...舞会吗？ 
Do you wanna go to Prom...?

391
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
所以...觉得呢？ 
So... What do you think?

392
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,460
关于什么？ 
About what?

393
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,100
会去..? 
Do you wanna go...?

394
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
舞会吗？ 
To Prom...?

395
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,600
跟...我一起？ 
With...me?

396
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:26,900
喔，我..舞会.. 
Oh! I... Prom...

397
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,900
跳舞… 
Dancing...

398
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,700
对我来说不是好主意 
Not such a good idea for me.

399
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
无论如何，那个周末我有事 
I have something that weekend, anyway.

400
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
我刚好那个周末要去杰克逊维州 
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

401
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,300
不能在另一个周末去吗？ 
You can't go another weekend?

402
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,800
我买的是不能退的车票 
Non-refundable ticket.

403
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,300
你应该去邀请洁西卡的 
You should ask Jessica.

404
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,700
我知道她想和你一起去 
I know she wants to go with you.

405
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,590
呦，呦，呦 
Yo, yo, yo

406
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:52,480
嘿，大伙们，拜托一下 
hey guys! Come on!

407
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,400
我们该走了吧！绿色代表什么意思 ? 
We gotta go, we gotta go!- Green is what?

408
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,800
对！咱们出发啦！ 
Good! Let's go!

409
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:58,196
大伙们，走 
Guys, come on!

410
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,300
搭另一部.另一部车..走吧 
Other bus.Other bus..Let's go

蛋壳，胡萝卜叶端.. 
Eggshells, carrot-tops...

412
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,700
堆肥是很酷的 !里面的这些原料.. 
Compost is cool! Now stuff it in there..

413
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,300
是的，是的老师 
Yes sir! Yes sir!

00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,100
很棒，很棒 
Very good, very good.

415
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:13,100
现在我要做一杯热腾腾的堆肥茶 
Now I'm gonna make a steaming cup of compost-tea.

416
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,600
给我.. 
Give me that..

417
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,446
对啊，同学们，这是资源回收的最基本模式 
Yeah, this is recycling in its most basic form, guys

418
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,746
那个不能喝啦！那是给植物喝的.. 
Don't drink it! It's for the plants...

419
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,700
去杰克逊维州做什么呢 ? 
What's in Jacksonville?

420
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,200
你怎么知道的? 
How did you know about that?

421
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
我...没回答我的问题 
I...You didn't answer my question.

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,680
这个嘛，你也没回答过我的问题，所以.. 
Well, you don't answer any of mine, so...

423
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,100
我是说，你甚至连对我说「嗨」都没有 
I mean, you don't even say 'Hi' to me.

424
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,800
嗨 
Hi

425
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,500
你愿意告诉我，你是怎么挡住车子的吗 ? 
Are you gonna tell me how you stopped the van?

426
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:46,000
是啊...我的肾上腺素上升 
Yeah...I had an adrenaline rush.

427
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,300
那很正常 
It's very common.

428
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:49,100
可以上Google查 
You can Google-it.

429
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,800
佛罗里达人.. 
Floridians...

430
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
这就是杰克逊维的事(意指：胡扯) 
That's what's in Jacksonville.

431
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,200
拜托至少走路小心点好吗 ！？ 
Can you at least watch where you walk?!

432
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,738
听我说.. 我很抱歉一直都不太有礼貌 
Look... I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.

433
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:06,920
我认为这样是最好的方式 
I just think it's the best way.

434
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:09,232
贝拉！猜猜谁约我去舞会.. 
Bella! Guess who's just asked me to Prom.

435
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,800
嗯..我一直以为麦克会邀请 
Um, yeah..I actually thought Mike was gonna ask you.

436
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:18,200
呃，不觉得这有点奇怪吗 ? 
Um, it's not gonna be weird though, right?

437
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:20,200
不会，一点都不奇怪 
No, zero weirdness.

438
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,200
大伙儿都在，真好 
You guys are great together.

439
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,200
对呀，我知道 
I know, right?

440
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,200
贝拉，看 
Bella, look.

441
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,300
一条虫，一条虫… 
It's a worm... It's a worm...

442
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
贝拉..我们不应该做朋友的 
Bella...We shouldn't be friends.

443
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
你未免太杞人忧天了吧 
You really should figured that out a little earlier.

444
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,900
我意思是，你当初为什么不让车子压扁我 
I mean, why didn't you just let the van crush me.

445
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,900
省的你在这里....后悔了？ 
And save yourself all this... regret?

446
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
认为我后悔救了？ 
You think I regret saving you?

447
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:51,600
我以为你是这样的..我只是 .. 
I can see that you do.. I just...

448
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,800
不知道为什么 
Don't know why.

449
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,600
还真是什么都不知道 
You don't know anything.

450
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,300
嗨！呃…要搭我们的车吗 ? 
Hi! Um.Are you gonna be riding with us?

451
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,600
不，我们的巴士坐满了 
No, our bus is full.

452
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
妈妈又....打来了 
Your mom called...Again.

453
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,100
好吧，都怪你 
Well, that's your fault.

454
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,949
你不该告诉她这件小意外的 
You shouldn't have told her about the almost-accident.

455
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,826
你吃完了吗？ 
Are you finished?

456
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:20,900
是的 
Yeah.

457
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,400
说的对，她总是最擅长担心了 
I suppose you're right.She always did know how to worry.

458
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,800
她似乎跟以前不太一样 
She seems different.

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,700
她变的好像比较开心了 
She seems happy.

460
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,873
费尔听起来像是个不错的男人 
Phil sounds like an alright guy.

461
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
是阿，他是不错 
Yeah, he is.

462
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
好吧.. 
Alright...

463
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,780
嘿 ! 拉布席（印地安保留区），宝贝，要加入吗 ? 
Hey! La Push, baby... Are you in?

464
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,550
那代表什么意思 ? 
Should I know what that means?

465
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,800
库利特斯保留区的拉布席海滩 
La Push Beach down the Quileute Rez.

466
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:07,800
我们明天都要去那里玩 
We're all going tomorrow.

467
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:09,165
对啊，那儿很好玩的 
Yeah, there's a big fun coming in.

468
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,197
我可不只会在网络上冲浪而已 
And I don't just surf the Internet.

469
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:12,375
艾瑞克，你才只站起来过一次而已 
Eric, you stood up once.

470
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:13,591
那不过是一块发泡的板子 
And it was a foam board.

471
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:15,753
那边还有鲸鱼可以看呢，和我们一起去吧 
But there's whale watching too. Come with us.

472
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:16,903
拉布席，宝贝… 
La Push, baby...

473
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,932
是...拉布席 
It's... La Push.

474
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,100
你只要别再碎碎念，我就去，好吗 ? 
I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?

475
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,414
说真的，你那种语气真恶心阿，兄弟 
Seriously dude... It's creepy, man.

476
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,363
食物摆设艺术？ 
Edible art?

477
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,099
贝拉 
Bella.

478
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,500
谢谢 
Thanks.

479
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:36,113
你知道吗，你的态度反反复覆真令人难以捉摸 
You know, your mood swings are kind of giving me a whiplash.

480
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,299
我只说我们不做朋友会比较好 
I only said it'd be better for you if we weren't friends,

481
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:41,659
但那不是我所想要的 
Not that I didn't want to be.

482
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:42,571
那是什么意思 ？ 
What does that mean?

483
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:47,245
意思是够聪明的话，应该离我远些 
It means, if you're smart, you'd stay away from me.

484
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,869
呃，就理论上而言，我是不够机伶的 
Well, let's say for argument sake that I'm not smart.

485
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:52,712
你愿意告诉我真相吗 ? 
Will you tell me truth?

486
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:54,218
不，可能不会 
No, probably not.

487
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:57,228
我宁可听听你的理论 
I'd rather hear your theories.

488
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:03,079
我有想过放射线辐射变种的.. 
I have considered... radioactive

489
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,779
蜘蛛人或是摸过氪星石的超人 
spiders and Kryptonite.

490
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,141
都是些超级英雄，对吗？ 
That's all super-hero stuff, right?

491
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:11,020
那如果我不是英雄呢？ 
What if I'm not the hero?

492
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:12,216
如果我是.. 
What if I'm..

493
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,465
坏人呢？ 
The bad guy?

494
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:15,203
你不是的 
You're not.

495
00:31:16,496 --> 00:31:18,435
我能理解你为何想推拖 
I can see what you're trying to put off.

496
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:20,770
但我明白你只是不希望别人接近你 
But I can see that it's just to keep people away from you.

497
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:21,642
那只是伪装而已 
That's a mask.

498
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,061
不如我们.. 
Why don't we just...

499
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:30,296
一起聚会 ? 
Hang out?

500
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:33,800
大家都要去海边 
Everybody is going to the beach.

501
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:34,894
一起来吧 
Come

502
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,085
我的意思是，很好玩 
I mean, have fun.

503
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,938
哪个海滩？ 
Which beach?

504
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:44,939
拉布席 
La Push.

505
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,500
我不知道 
I don't know.

506
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,260
那个海滩有什么不好吗？ 
Is there something wrong with that beach?

507
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,534
只是有点拥挤 
It's just a little crowded.

508
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:03,200
冷死了 
Its freezing.

509
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,421
你应该出来走走的，伙计 
You gotta go out, folks.

510
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,366
我都不知道是否值得这么做 
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

511
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,488
我们都大老远开车来这了 
We're all the way out here

512
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,620
- 至少也要拿桨划一下 - 是啊 -
I'm at Ieast paddIing out. -Yeah

513
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:12,000
- 她是对的 - 你们这群宝贝蛋 -
She's right. -You guys are babies.

514
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,553
所以我一直期待艾瑞克邀请我去舞会 
So, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask me to the Prom

515
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,197
但...他却没有 
And he just...doesn't.

516
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,065
应该去邀请他 
You should ask him.

517
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,783
主动点，是个独立的女强人 
Take control. You are a strong independent woman.

518
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:28,486
我是吗？ 
I am?

519
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,487
是的 
Yes.

520
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:31,753
能帮帮我吗？ 
Can you help me out?

521
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:32,754
好啊 
Yeah.

522
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:35,659
贝拉！ 
Bella!

523
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,098
嗨，雅各布！大伙们，这是雅各布 
Hi Jacob!Guys, this is Jacob.

524
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,084
嗨，大家好 ! 
Hey, Guys. How you doing?

525
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,000
嗨 
Hi.

526
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,100
嘿 
Hey.

527
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:43,476
你想干嘛，跟踪我吗？ 
What are you, like, stalking me?

528
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,330
可是在我的地盘呢，记得吗？ 
You're on my rez, remember?

529
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,726
冲浪吗 ? 
Are you surfing?

530
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:49,744
当然不是 
Definitely not.

531
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:52,581
你们应该陪陪贝拉 
You guys should keep Bella company.

532
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:53,581
呃，她的约会泡汤了 
Um,her date bailed.

533
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:54,582
什么约会？ 
What date?

534
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,448
她邀请了爱德华 
She invited Edward.

535
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,077
只是出于礼貌而已 
To be polite, that's it.

536
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,500
我觉得她不错，敢去约爱德华，没有人试过 
I think it's nice she invited him.Nobody ever does.

537
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,011
是啊，因为库伦家都是怪胎 
Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.

538
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,480
你还真说对了 
You got that right!

539
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,493
你们认识他？ 
You guys know him?

540
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:07,537
库伦家族不会来这里的 
The Cullens don't come here.

541
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,166
你的朋友说的是什么意思 
What did your friends mean about.

542
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,200
你知道的，『库伦家族不会来这里的』？ 
You know, 'The Cullens don't come here'?

543
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,950
听到了，呃? 
You caught that, huh?

544
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,700
我不该说任何关于这件事的 
I'm not really supposed to say anything about it.

545
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:30,500
嘿，我会保密的 
Hey, I can keep a secret.

546
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,100
呃，这就像是个古老的恐怖故事 
Um, really it's just like an old scary story.

547
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,963
好，我想知道 
Well, I want to know.

548
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:48,190
好吧，知道库利特斯部族传说是狼的后裔吗？ 
Okay, did you know that Quileutes are supposedly descendants from wolves?

549
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,396
什么？ 
What?

550
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,100
像狼...真的野狼？ 
Like wolves... Real wolves?

551
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,563
是的..其实那就是我们部族的传说 
Yeah...That's a legend of our tribe.

552
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:59,486
好吧，那这个跟库伦家族有什么关系 ? 
Okay.So, what's the story about the Cullens?

553
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:04,756
嗯..他们可能也是像类似这样的后裔 
Well, they're supposedly descendants from this,

554
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:07,552
但与我们部族是敌对的关系 
Like...Enemy clan.

555
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:13,043
我的曾祖父，酋长，曾发现他们在我们的土地狩猎 
My great-grandfather, the chief,found them hunting on our land.

556
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:19,004
但他们自认为是异类，所以我们就缔结了约定 
But they claimed to be something different, so.. We made a treaty with them.

557
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,677
如果他们不踏入库利特斯这片领地 
If they promised to say off Quileute lands,

558
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:24,299
那我们也不会泄露他们真正的身份... T
hen we wouldn't expose what they really were...

559
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,451
给白种人知道 
to the pale faces.

560
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,094
我以为他们才刚搬来这 
I thought they just moved here.

561
00:34:30,762 --> 00:34:32,302
或者是刚搬回来 
Or just moved back.

562
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,005
那他们到底是什么东西？ 
What are they really?

563
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,854
这只是个故事，贝拉 
It's just a story, Bella.

564
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,708
来吧，我们走吧 
Come on, let's go.

565
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,472
<i>..我妈妈说我不会哄小猫叫.. 
My mamma said I didn't know how to make a kitten meow...</i>

566
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,472
你好？ 
Hello?

567
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:19,712
小妞？ 
Girl?

568
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,400
小妞！ 
Girl!

569
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:43,109
你好 
Hello.

570
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,714
外套很好看 
Nice jacket.

571
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:49,842
你是谁？ 
Who are you?

572
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:52,107
总是千篇一律的蠢问题 
It's always the same inane questions.

573
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,218
"你是谁？" 
'Who are you?'

574
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,564
"你想干什么" 
'What do you want?'

575
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,550
"你为什么这么做？" 
'Why are you doing this?'

576
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:00,051
詹姆斯.. 
James...

577
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,906
别再戏弄我们的食物了 
Let's not play with our food.

578
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,500

他不在这里 
He's not here.

584
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,927
每当天气好的时候，库伦家族就消失了 
Whenever the weather's nice the Cullens disappear.

585
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,993
什么 ? 他们放弃好天气了？ 
What? They just ditch?

586
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:05,807
不是啦，库伦夫妇会带着他们去旅行、露营、吃东西 
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for hiking and camping and stuff.

587
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:08,195
我对我父母用过这招，一点也没用 
I tried that on my parents..Not even close.

588
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:10,939
嘿，我要跟艾瑞克去参加舞会了！ 
Guys! I'm going to the Prom with Eric.

589
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,117
我邀请他....我采取主动了 
I just asked him... I took control.

590
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:14,615
我就说过这会管用的 
I told you that would happen.

591
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,716
确定一定要出远门吗？ 
Are you sure you have to go out of town?

592
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,739
哦，是的，家里的一些杂事要处理 
Oh, yeah. It's a weird family thing.

593
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,992
好吧，我们该去安吉拉斯港购物了 
Okay, we should go shopping to Port Angeles

594
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,722
免得被别人抢先买光了 
before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

595
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:28,140
安吉拉斯港？ 
Port Angeles?

596
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,907
们介意我去吗？ 
You mind if I come?

597
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,777
当然不，我需要的建议... 
Yeah! I need your opinion

598
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:35,154
我喜欢这件 
I like this one

599
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:36,155
很正点 
That's cool.

600
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,138
但是我搞不懂这种细肩带的 
But I don't know about the one-shoulder thing

601
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:38,968
我喜欢这件 
I like this one.

602
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,764
对，我喜欢这种编织 
Yeah, I like the knitting.

603
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,122
洁西，觉得怎么样？熏衣草色？ 
Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

604
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:43,371
那个好吗 ? 颜色适合我吗 ? 
Is that good? Is that my color?

605
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:46,124
我喜欢，我偏好暗玫瑰色这件 
I like it. I like that dusty-rose one too.

606
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,125
喔，我喜欢这件 .... 
Okay, I like this one..

607
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:48,917
它让我的大胸脯看来不错 
It makes my boobs look good.

608
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,000

呃，蛮恶心的... 
Oh, it's disgusting...

00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,111
真漂亮 
You're pretty.

别碰我 
Don't touch me.

637
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:26,911
说真的 ，应该… 
Seriously, you should...

638
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,185
别碰我！ 
Don't touch me!

刚刚真的是个很危险的…举动

641
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,850
我应该回去把那些家伙的头拧下来的

不，你不可以 
No, you shouldn't.

643
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,662
不知道他们卑鄙下流的脑袋在想什么 
You don't know the vile, repulsive things they're thinking.

644
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:16,860
你知道？ 
And you do?

645
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,591
这并不难猜 
It was not hard to guess.

646
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,384
能说些别的话题... 
Can you talk about something else...

647
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,672
来分散我的注意力，好让我不调头回去吗？ 
And distract me so I won't turn around?

648
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:28,434
你能系上安全带吗？ 
Can you just put your seatbelt on?

649
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,448
呵，系上自己的就可以了 
Put your own seatbelt on.

650

去哪了 ? 我们有留讯息给

我们有等，但是肚子饿了，所以我们..

653
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:49,058
我很抱歉我耽误了贝拉的晚餐

我们凑巧遇到，然后聊太久了

没事，我们能理解，我的意思是 ....

656
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,045
碰巧，对吗？ 
That happens, right?

00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:02,605
嗯，我们要走了，那么… 
Um, we were just leaving so...

658
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,049

00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,882
我想我该让贝拉吃点东西 
I think I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.

660
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:10,630
如果愿意的话 
If you'd like.

661
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,064
我会开车送回家的 
I'll drive you home myself.

那真是...太体贴了 
That's so... thoughtful.

663
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:19,392
对啊，真是贴心 
It's really thoughtful, yeah.

664
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,814
对，我该吃点东西 
Yeah, I should eat something.

665
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,860
好吧，那就...明天见了 
Okay, so... I'll see you tomorrow.

666

不客气 
Yeah, no problem.

671
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:48,807
呃...真的不必帮你点什么吗 ? 
So..Are you sure there isn't anything I can get for you?

672
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,029
不用了，谢谢你 
No, no. Thank you.

673
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,625
有需要可以叫我 
Let me know.

674
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,512
你真的不吃点东西吗? 
You're really not gonna eat?

675
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:06,828
不，我只是在...节食中

676
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:09,903
你真的该给我一些解释 
You gotta give me some answers.

677
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,104
是的....不... 
Yes... No...

00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,186
去了解事情的另一面... 
To get to the other side...

00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,088
我不想知道圆周率的平方根

早就知道? 
You knew that?

682
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,284
你怎么知道我在哪里的？ 
How did you know where I was?

683
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:26,479
我不知道 
I didn't.

684
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:28,155
好吧… 
Alright...

所以你跟踪我了 
So you followed me.

我试着与保持距离 
I was trying to keep a distance

除非需要我帮助，然后...

接着我听见那些人渣在想的事情… 
I heard what those low-lives were thinking...

692
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:57,652
等等 
Wait

你说你能听见他们在想什么？ 
You say you heard what they were thinking?

694
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,936
那是什么...你会读人的心思.. 
So what...You read minds...

695

我能读这屋子里每个人的心思

It's very frustrating.

702
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,532
我算不正常吗 ? 
There's something wrong with me?

703
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:51,232
我说我能读心，而却说不正常 
I tell you I can read minds and you think there's something wrong with you.

704
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,629
怎么了? 
What is it?

705
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,396
我已没有... 
I don't have...

706
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,597
能力... 
The strength...

707
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:09,104
再和保持距离了

708
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,956
那就不要 
Then don't.

709
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:34,223
好了，我觉得我够暖和了

你的手很冰 
Your hand is so cold.

711

00:50:45,674 --> 00:50:46,700
大声的说出来... 
Out loud..

768
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:50,916
说啊 
Say it!

769
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,256
吸血鬼 
Vampire.

770
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:03,277
害怕吗？ 
Are you afraid?

771
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:12,729
不 
No.

772
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:17,653
那问我一个最基本的问题 
Then ask me the most basic question

773
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,094
"我们吃什么" 
'What do we eat?'

774
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:24,344
你不会伤害我的 
You won't hurt me.

775
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,654
我们要去哪？ 
Where are we going?

776
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:35,405
到山顶上，没有云雾垄罩的地方 
Up the mountain, out of the cloud bag.

777
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:38,231
必须看看我在阳光下的样子 
You need to see what I look like in the sunlight.

778
00:51:57,888 --> 00:52:00,334
这就是为何我们不在阳光下暴露的原因 
This is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight.

779
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:02,504
人们会发现我们是异类 
People would know we're different.

780
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,827
这就是真正的我 
This is what I am.

781
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,164
看起来像钻石似的.. 
It's like diamonds...

782
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:32,986
你好美 
You're beautiful.

783
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,824
美？这可是杀人魔的皮肤呢，贝拉 
Beautiful?This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

784
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,456
我就是一个杀人魔 
I'm a killer.

785
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:51,862
我不相信 
I don't believe that.

786
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,122
那是因为只相信谎言 
That's because you believe the lie...

787
00:52:56,395 --> 00:52:57,968
那都是骗人的 
It's camouflage.

788
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:03,074
我是世界上最危险的掠食者 
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

789
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:07,468
我所有的一切都在引诱你过来 
Everything about me invites you in.

790
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:11,469
我的声音，容貌 ...甚至我的气味 
My voice, my face... Even my smell.

791
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:14,175
其实我并不需要这些伪装 
As if I would need any of that.

792
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,037
根本跑不过我！ 
As if you could outrun me!

793
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:27,078
根本无法抵抗我！ 
As if you could fight me off.

794
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:32,594
我天生就是个掠杀者 
I'm designed to kill.

795
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:37,205
我不在乎 
I don't care.

796
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,364
我以前杀过人 
I've killed people before.

797
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,838
那没关系 
It doesn't matter.

798
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,764
我曾想过要杀了 
I wanted to kill you.

799
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:58,850
我一生从未如此渴望的想要一个人的血 
I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life.

800
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:01,043
我信任你 
I trust you.

801
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:05,062
别这么想 
Don't.

802
00:54:06,405 --> 00:54:07,878
我就在这，我相信你 
I'm here, I trust you.

803
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,656
我的家族，我们跟同类有所不同 
My family, we're different from others of our kind.

804
00:54:15,657 --> 00:54:17,559
我们只猎杀动物 
We only hunt animals.

805
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,271
我们已经学会控制身体的欲望 
We've learned to control our thirst.

806
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,517
而 ..的气息 ... 
As to you... Your scent...

807
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,517
却好像是专门为我配制的毒品 
Is like a drug to me.

808
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:34,473
简直是我个人品牌的海洛因 
Like my own personal brand of heroin.

809
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:44,108
那就是我们初次见面为何你那么讨厌我的原因？ 
Then,Why did you hate me so much when we met?

810
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:45,387
确实如此 
I did.

811
00:54:45,393 --> 00:54:49,287
就是因为发觉自己多么渴望想得到 
Only for making me want you so badly.

812
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,845
我到现在还不知道是否控制得了自己 
I still don't know if I can control myself.

813
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:55,715
我知道你可以的 
I know you can.

814
00:55:04,028 --> 00:55:06,098
我读不到的心 
I can't read your mind,

815
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:09,457
得告诉我现在在想什么 
you have to tell me what you're thinking.

816
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:13,896
现在我害怕了 
Now I'm afraid.

817
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,111
很好 
Good.

818
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:23,367
我不是害怕你.. 
I'm not afraid of you...

819
00:55:26,913 --> 00:55:28,891
我只是害怕失去你 
I'm only afraid of losing you.

820
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,505
害怕你会突然消失.. 
Like you're going to disappear..

821
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:41,500
不知道我等了多久 
You don't know how long I've waited for you.

822
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:52,775
就这样，狮子爱上了羔羊 
And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.

823
00:55:56,305 --> 00:55:58,157
多蠢的羔羊 
What a stupid lamb.

824
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:01,724
多病态又自虐的狮子 
What a sick, masochistic lion.

825
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:29,378
现在有三件事我很肯定 
About three things I was absolutely positive.

826
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:35,017
首先，爱德华是个吸血鬼 
First, Edward was a vampire.

827
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:43,636
第二，他体内天性的一部分 
Second, there was a part of him,

828
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:46,024
而我不知道这个部分有多大 
and I didn't know how dominant that part might be,

829
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:49,242
会渴望喝我的血 
that thirsted for my blood.

830
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,597
第三 
And third,

831
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:00,070
我已经毫无保留地，无可救药地爱上了他 
I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

832
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:08,044
蒙地卡罗？这是我们舞会的主题？ 
Monte Carlo? That's our Prom theme?

833
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:12,013
嗯，赌博...燕尾服... 
Uhu, gambling..Tuxedos...

834
00:58:12,014 --> 00:58:13,395
还有庞德 ...詹姆士庞德 
And Bond...James Bond.

835
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,530
喔..我的...天啊 
Oh...My...God

836
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:33,862
你知道吗，大家都开始盯着我们看.. 
You know, everybody's staring...

837
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:39,487
那个人不是… 
Not that guy...

838
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:41,421
不，他只是看看 
No, he just looked.

839
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,128
反正我已经打破所有规矩了 
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

840
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:48,358
我迟早都要下地狱的 
Since I'm going to hell.

841
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,800
所以，一个人必须要濒临死亡的时候.. 
So... Does a person have to be dying...

842
00:58:58,337 --> 00:58:59,983
才能变成像你一样？ 
To become like you?

843
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,965
不，只有卡莱尔办得到 
No, that's just ...Carlisle.

844
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,168
他从不强迫别人变成吸血鬼 
He'd never do this to someone..

845
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,100
只要对方还有一线生机的话 
who had another choice.

846
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:12,898
那你这样已经多久了？ 
So, how long have you been like this?

847
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,455
从1918年起... 
Since 1918...

848
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:18,029
那是卡莱尔发现我 .... 
That's when Carlisle found me...

849
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,023
即将要死于西班牙流感 
Dying of Spanish Influenza.

850
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:23,659
那是甚么样的感觉 ? 
What was it like?

851
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:27,023
那毒液...让人很难忍受 
The venom ...was excruciating

852
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,990
但卡莱尔要承受更多的痛苦与挣扎 
But what Carlisle did was much harder.

853
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:32,593
我们之中没几个能控制得那么好 
Not many of us have the restraint to do that.

854
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:35,352
但是，他不是只需要..咬一口吗 ? 
But didn't he just have to... bite?

855
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:38,761
不完全是 
Not exactly.

856
00:59:39,218 --> 00:59:41,818
当我们尝到了.. 
When we taste...

857
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:44,441
人类的血 
Human blood.

858
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:47,358
会产生一种狂乱的欲望 
A sort of frenzy begins.

859
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:51,295
那种狂乱几乎无法停止 
It's almost impossible to stop.

860
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,649
但卡莱尔却办到了 
But Carlisle did.

861
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,836
首先是我.. 
First with me...

862
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:57,307
然后是他的妻子，艾丝蜜 
And then with his wife, Esme.

863
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:02,650
所以，卡莱尔是让你不会杀人的真正原因 ? 
So, is Carlisle the real reason that you don't... kill people?

864
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,794
不，那不是唯一的原因 
No, that's not the only reason.

865
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,564
我不想变成一个怪物 
I don't want to be a monster.

866
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:18,389
我们家族自认为是素食者 
My family, we think of ourselves as vegetarians.

867
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,400
因为我们是靠动物的血维生的 
Cause we only survive on the blood of animals.

868
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:27,260
就像是人类只靠奶糖过活一样 
It's...like a human only living on toffee.

869
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:32,413
它可以保持体力但无法吃的饱 
It keeps you strong but you're never fully satisfied.

870
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:38,638
绝对跟吸的血完全不同，呵 
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood, for instance.

871
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,909
是不是有其它的吸血鬼杀了维隆 ? 
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

872
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:48,293
对 
Yeah,

873
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:50,121
外头还有其它的吸血鬼 
there are others out there.

874
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:53,136
我们时常会碰巧遇到他们 
We run into them from time to time.

875
01:00:54,709 --> 01:00:59,167
你家族的人也和你一样会读心术吗 ? 
Can the rest of your family read people's minds like you can?

876
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:03,667
不，只有我可以 
No, no. That's just me.

877
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:07,829
不过艾莉丝能预见未来 
But Alice can see the future.

878
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,727
我打赌她看见我来了 
I bet she saw me coming.

879
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,131
艾莉丝的预知是有主观性的 
Alice's vision is subjective.

880
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,296
我的意思是，未来随时会改变的 
I mean, the future can always change.

881
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,390
天啊，你的行为能像个人一样吗 ? 
God..can you act human?

882
01:01:29,392 --> 01:01:30,747
我的意思是我还有邻居 
I mean, I've got neighbors.

883
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:32,493
我明天想要带去我家 
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

884
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:35,635
谢了 
Thanks.

885
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,868
等等，是要去见你家人吗 ? 
Wait, with your family?

886
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:40,362
对 
Yeah.

887
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:42,683
万一他们不喜欢我怎么办？ 
What if they don't like me?

888
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,128
所以..担心的是 
So you're worried ...

889
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:47,605
不是因为在一个满是吸血鬼的屋子里.. 
not because you'll be in a house full of vampires but..

890
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:50,916
而是因为觉得他们不会接受？ 
Because you think they won't approve of you?

891
01:01:51,387 --> 01:01:53,300
我很高兴我逗你笑了 
I'm glad I amuse you.

892
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:55,991
怎么了? 
What is it?

893
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:58,986
这说来复杂 
A complication.

894
01:02:00,993 --> 01:02:02,432
我明天来接 
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

895
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,397
嘿，来拜访你的卡车吗？ 
Hey! Come to visit your truck?

896
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:34,848
看起来不错嘛 
Looks good.

897
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:35,700
凹痕没了 
Got that dent out.

898
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,469
是啊 
Yeah.

899
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,993
其实我们是来拜访你家电视的 
Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

900
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:40,500
本季水手队的首场比赛阿，非看不可 
First Mariners game of the season.

901
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:43,624
再加上雅各布老是嚷着要见 
Plus, Jacob here keeps bugging me about seeing you again.

902
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,745
好样的，爸....谢了 
Great, dad..Thanks.

903
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:48,299
诚实点吧，孩子 
Just keeping it real, son.

904
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:51,388
麦芽白酒 
Pale Ale.

905
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:53,193
干的好，警长 
Well done, Chief.

906
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,314
克尔渥特哈利家传的美味炸鱼 
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

907
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,236
非常好 
Good.

908
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,839
维隆的案子有什么进展吗？ 
Any luck with that Waylon case?

909
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,611
嗯，我总觉得不是野兽所为 
Well, I don't think it was an animal that killed him.

910
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,691
我从不这么认为 
I never thought it was.

911
01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:10,371
你在保留区放话了没，呃 ? 
You spread the word out at the rez, huh?

912
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:11,722
让孩子们远离森林 
Keep the kids out of the woods.

913
01:03:11,723 --> 01:03:12,815
会照办的 
Will do.

914
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:18,533
不希望再有任何人受伤了，对吧？ 
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

915
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,394
真是令人难以置信 
This is incredible.

916
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:59,462
这地方宽敞又明亮，你知道的 
It's so white and open, you know.

917
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:02,531
以为这里是什么模样？ 
What did you expect.

918
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:04,792
棺木，地窖和壕沟 ? 
Coffins and dungeons and moats?

919
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:07,650
不，壕沟就不必了 
No, not the moats.

920
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:09,991
壕沟不必...呵 
Not the moats...

921
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:20,004
这是我们唯一不必躲藏的地方 
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

922
01:04:22,165 --> 01:04:24,289
我吩咐过他们别如此大费周章的 
I told them not to do this.

923
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:29,082
<i>加点橄榄油在这个平底锅上 
You add a little of olive oil to a non-stick saut's pan.</i>

924
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:35,082
<i>再来把这些肉切成小块的，然后.. 
What I do, I cut this in strips and then..</i>

925
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:37,269
她是意大利人？ 
Is she even Italian?

926
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:38,862
她的名字叫贝拉 
Her name is Bella.

927
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:40,621
我肯定不管吃什么她都会喜欢的 
I'm sure she'll love it no matter what.

928
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:43,650
喔...深呼吸看看 
Get a whiff of that

929
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:46,102
有人类来 
Here comes the human.

930
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:52,714
贝拉 ! 我们为了做意大利料理呢 
Bella! We're making Italiano for you.

931
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,462
哦 
Oh!

932
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,437
贝拉，这是艾丝蜜 
Bella, this is Esme.

933
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,261
我把她当作是亲妈妈 
My mother for all intents and purposes.

934
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,205
早安（意大利语） 
Buon giorno.

935
01:04:59,206 --> 01:05:00,834
非常好（意大利语） 
Molto Bene!

936
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:03,296
让我们第一次有机会用到厨房 
You've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time.

937
01:05:03,297 --> 01:05:04,549
我想一定饿了吧 
I hope you're hungry.

938
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,999
是的，我真的满饿的 
Yeah, absolutely.

939
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:06,988
她吃过了 
She already ate.

940
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:14,784
好极了！ 
Perfect!

941
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,647
呃，这实在.. 
Yeah, it's just...

942
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:19,608
我...我知道你们不吃这些.. 
I..I know you guys don't eat..

943
01:05:19,643 --> 01:05:22,464
当然，真善解人意 
Of course, it's very considerate of you.

944
01:05:22,465 --> 01:05:24,156
别在意罗莎莉，像我这样 
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.

945
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:28,031
好吧，让我们假装这样对我们大家都很安全 
Yeah, let's just keep pretending like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

946
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:31,682
我绝不会告诉任何人的 
I would never tell anybody anything

947
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:33,430
她知道该怎么作 
She knows that.

948
01:05:33,865 --> 01:05:35,715
对，好吧，但问题是.. 
Yeah, well, the problem is..

949
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:37,339
你们两个现在是公开的了，所以.. 
You two have become public now, so...

950
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:38,490
艾密特 ! 
Emmett!

951
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:39,910
不，她必须明白 
No,she should know.

952
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:43,293
如果你们结局不好，整个家族都会被牵连的 
The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly.

953
01:05:44,192 --> 01:05:46,174
最坏的结果就是... 
Badly as in...

954
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:50,044
我....我变成食物 
I....I become the meal.

955
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:58,381
嗨，贝拉 ! 
Hi, Bella!

956
01:06:02,548 --> 01:06:04,187
我是艾莉丝 
I'm Alice.

957
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,562
嗨 ! 
Hi.

958
01:06:07,595 --> 01:06:09,578
哦，闻起来确实很不错 
Oh, you do smell good.

959
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,589
艾莉丝，在…？ 
Alice, what are you...?

960
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,896
别担心啦，贝拉和我会成为好朋友的 
It's ok. Bella and I are gonna be great friends.

961
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,733
抱歉，贾斯柏是最后加入的素食者 
Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

962
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,894
对他来说还有点难适应 
It's a little difficult for him.

963
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,870
很荣幸认识 
It's a pleasure to meet you.

964
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:27,880
没问题的，贾斯柏，你不会伤害她的 
It's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.

965
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:29,913
好吧...呃... 
Alright...

966
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,788
我带你去四处参观一下吧 
I'm gonna take you on a tour of the rest of the house.

967
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,046
我们待会儿见 
I'll see you soon.

968
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:35,911
好的 
Okay.

969
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,548
很可爱呢 
Cute..

970
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:41,772
看来进展的不错 
I think that went well.

971
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:42,966
把这里弄干净 
Clean this up.

972
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:44,293
马上！ 
Now!

973
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:47,519
应该也跟我一样觉得不自在吧？ 
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

974
01:06:47,594 --> 01:06:49,391
我不知道 
I don't know.

975
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:56,729
毕业帽？ 
Graduation caps?

976
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:58,596
对 
Yeah,

977
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:01,041
这是私下的玩笑 
it's a private joke.

978
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,576
我们入学很多次 
We matriculate a lot.

979
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,835
那有点可怜 
That's kind of miserable.

980
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:09,235
我指的是，不断的重复念高中 
I mean, repeating High School over and over.

981
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,667
只有在新的地方我们出现的时候越年轻 
Sure but the younger we start out in a new place,

982
01:07:12,668 --> 01:07:14,387
我们才能停留的越久 
the longer we can stay there.

983
01:07:14,388 --> 01:07:15,912
来吧 
Come on.

984
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:28,066
嗯，对，这就是我的房间 
Um, yeah.This is my room.

985
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:41,863
没有床？ 
No bed?

986
01:07:41,864 --> 01:07:43,926
呃...没有 
No,

987
01:07:45,098 --> 01:07:46,224
我不睡觉的 
I don't sleep.

988
01:07:47,128 --> 01:07:48,196
从不？ 
Ever?

989
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,879
是的，从不 
No.no.no

990
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:53,782
好吧.. 
Okay...

991
01:08:02,794 --> 01:08:05,130
看起来你很喜欢听音乐 
You have so much music.

992
01:08:05,365 --> 01:08:08,101
你都听些什么音乐 ? 
What were you listening to?

993
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:12,989
德布西 
It's Debussy.

994
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:16,989
对 
Yeah.

995
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,910
这首『月光』很棒 
Clair de Lune is great.

996
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,788
怎么了？ 
What?

997
01:08:59,863 --> 01:09:00,905
我不会跳舞 
I can't dance.

998
01:09:10,303 --> 01:09:12,533
没关系，我会想办法让跳舞的 
Well, I can always make you.

999
01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:15,991
我可不怕你 
I'm not scared of you.

1000
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:21,777
很好，会后悔说这话的 
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.

1001
01:09:27,521 --> 01:09:30,388
最好抓紧了，蜘蛛猴 
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

1002
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:37,224
相信我吗？ 
Do you trust me?

1003
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:39,149
理论上是的 
In theory.

1004
01:09:39,933 --> 01:09:41,867
那就闭上眼睛 
Then close your eyes.

1005
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:07,350
什么? 
What?

1006
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:10,656
这不像真的 
This isn't real.

1007
01:10:11,298 --> 01:10:13,962
这么美的地方根本不可能存在的 
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

1008
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,030
在我的世界里是存在的 
It does in my world.

1009
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,149
哇，别动 
Whoa! Hold on.

1010
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:53,889
是人的脚印 
It's human.

1011
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,839
亚历桑纳 ! 呦，怎么回事 ? 
Arizona! Yo, what's happening?

1012
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:03,399
所以和库伦是来真的吗 ? 
So..You and Cullen, huh?

1013
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:04,286
是的 
Yes.

1014
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:05,935
我不喜欢这样 
I don't like it,

1015
01:12:07,391 --> 01:12:11,416
我意思是...他看的眼神好像要吃掉一样 
I mean...He looks at you like you're something to eat

1016
01:12:14,354 --> 01:12:16,879
这是的有机套餐（吃套餐的临演是小说作者） 
Here's your veggie plate.

1017
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,984
抱歉来晚了，生物课作业 
I'm sorry I'm late. Biology Projects.

1018
01:12:20,139 --> 01:12:22,000
我帮你点了猪肉色拉 
I ordered you the Spam Salad.

1019
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,994
希望合你胃口 
I hope that's okay.

1020
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:25,834
下次你也该点点看这个.. 
You should order one for yourself next time.

1021
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,631
牛排加双蛋 
Cup-egg on a steak...

1022
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:30,833
嘿，我可壮的跟马一样呢 
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

1023
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,330
呃，警长，大伙儿都想知道 
So, Chief... Boys wanna know,

1024
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:39,210
今天在银溪沿岸有没有找到什么线索？ 
Did you find anything down by Creek Silver today?

1025
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:44,449
有，我们发现一个像是人类的赤脚足迹 
Yeah, We found a bare human footprint.

1026
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,883
不管它看起来像什么，往东边逃了 
But it looks like whatever that is,it's headed to east.

1027
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:49,717
而凯赛普州治安官会接手这个案子 
So, Ketsap's County sheriff is gonna take over from here.

1028
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:50,152
好 
Okay

1029
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:50,860
没问题吧？ 
Okay?

1030
01:12:51,324 --> 01:12:53,690
我只希望他们能尽快抓到凶手 
I just hope they catch them fast.

1031
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,836
朋友似乎在和打招呼呢 
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

1032
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,369
没事的，如果想去就去吧 
It's okay. If you wanna go, join them.

1033
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,180
反正我本来就想早点走 
I was gonna try to leave early anyway.

1034
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,847
我也是 
Me too.

1035
01:13:13,146 --> 01:13:15,614
贝拉，今天是周末，出去玩吧 
Bella, Friday night...Go out.

1036
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,585
看来纽顿家的孩子对很友善 
Looks like the Newton boy's got a big smile for you.

1037
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:20,870
是啊，他人还不错 
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

1038
01:13:21,928 --> 01:13:24,887
比镇上其它粗鲁的人好多了 
Better than any of these other yahoos in town.

1039
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:26,872
对哪一个有兴趣 ? 
Anybody you're interested?

1040
01:13:27,854 --> 01:13:29,633
爸，我们一定要谈男孩子吗 ? 
Dad, we're gonna talk about boys?

1041
01:13:31,644 --> 01:13:32,802
倒不用 
I guess not.

1042
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:37,569
我只是觉得我常留一个人 
I just feel like I leave alone too much.

1043
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,185
应该多去接触人群的 
You should be around people.

1044
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,016
我不介意一个人啊 
I don't mind being alone.

1045
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:46,739
我想这点是老爸遗传给我的 
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.

1046
01:13:51,562 --> 01:13:53,996
那么，球赛进行的怎么样了？ 
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

1047
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:56,534
喔，费尔似乎很努力 
Oh, Phil's working so hard.

1048
01:13:56,535 --> 01:13:59,120
知道的，春季训练开始了 
You know..Spring training.

1049
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:02,341
在一切敲定之前，我们要找到出租的房子 
We're looking for a house to rent in case thinks become more permanent.

1050
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:04,050
会喜欢杰克逊维尔州的，宝贝 
You'd like Jacksonville, baby.

1051
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:04,963
是吗？ 
Yeah?

1052
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,516
我真的很喜欢福克斯的人 
I'm really liking Forks.

1053
01:14:07,517 --> 01:14:08,415
什么？ 
What?!

1054
01:14:10,223 --> 01:14:12,208
福克斯镇征服我了 
Forks is getting to me.

1055
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:14,297
是不是和哪个男孩有关？ 
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

1056
01:14:16,803 --> 01:14:17,864
对.. 
Yeah...

1057
01:14:17,865 --> 01:14:21,001
我就知道，都说给我听吧，他是什么样的？运动员？ 
I knew it! Tell me everything.What is he? A jock?

1058
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:23,368
玩音乐的？我打赌他一定很聪明，对吧？ 
Indie? I bet he's smart.Is he smart?

1059
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:28,415
妈，我晚点再跟你聊，好吗 ? 
Mom, can I talk to you later?

1060
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:31,067
哎哟，我们正讨论男孩子呢，你们俩有作安全措施吗？ 
Come on, we gotta talk boys!Are you being safe?

1061
01:14:36,562 --> 01:14:37,990
你怎么进来的？ 
How did you get in here?

1062
01:14:39,122 --> 01:14:40,591
从窗户 
The window.

1063
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,593
你经常这么做？ 
Do you do that a lot?

1064
01:14:44,435 --> 01:14:46,928
几个月前才开始的而已 
Just the past couple months.

1065
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,376
我喜欢看睡觉的样子 
I like watching you sleep.

1066
01:14:52,377 --> 01:14:53,553
这个，呃... 
It's, um..

1067
01:14:54,062 --> 01:14:58,597
那对我来说很有吸引力 
Kind of fascinating to me.

1068
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:04,208
呃，我只想试试看一件事.. 
Um, I just want to try one thing...

1069
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,620
只要别动就好 
Stay very still.

1070
01:15:14,612 --> 01:15:16,248
别动.. 
Don't move...

1071
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:01,359
停！ 
Stop!

1072
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:05,474
我很抱歉 
I'm sorry.

1073
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:11,000
我比想象中的我更能自制 
I'm stronger than I thought.

1074
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:13,905
对，真希望我也能这么说 
Yeah... I wish I could say the same.

1075
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:21,143
我不能因为而失控 
I can never lose control with you.

1076
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:28,829
嘿，别走 
Hey, don't go.

1077
01:17:17,752 --> 01:17:19,282
嘿，我给你再拿一罐 
Hey, I got you another one.

1078
01:17:19,475 --> 01:17:20,492
谢谢 
Thanks.

1079
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:22,613
我跟爱德华．库伦在约会 
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

1080
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:27,702
他对来说有点老，不是吗？ 
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

1081
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:31,794
不会啊，我们俩都是高中生 
No.he's a junior, I'm a junior.

1082
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:34,806
我以为你喜欢库伦家的人 
I thought you liked the Cullens.

1083
01:17:35,538 --> 01:17:38,200
我以为你不会喜欢镇上的男孩 
I thought you didn't like any of the boys in town.

1084
01:17:38,306 --> 01:17:42,212
就专业角度来说...爱德华不算住在镇上 
Edward doesn't live in town.Technically.

1085
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,404
他现在就在门外 
He's right outside.

1086
01:17:47,818 --> 01:17:48,880
是吗 ? 
He is?

1087
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:52,121
是啊，他想要与你见面...正式的 
Yeah, he wanted to meet you...Officially.

1088
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:55,342
好啊 
Alright

1089
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:57,357
带他来吧 
Bring him in.

1090
01:17:58,433 --> 01:18:01,562
你会对他友善点吗？ 
Could you be nice?

1091
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:03,156
他对我很重要 
He is important.

1092
01:18:14,727 --> 01:18:15,913
史旺警长 
Chief Swan

1093
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:18,913
我想正式介绍我自己，我是爱德华．库伦 
I want to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward Cullen.

1094
01:18:19,772 --> 01:18:21,075
嗨，爱德华 
Hi, Edward.

1095
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:23,703
贝拉今晚不会太晚回家的 
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

1096
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,799
她只是与我的家人玩棒球 
She's just gonna play baseball with my family.

1097
01:18:25,803 --> 01:18:26,730
棒球？ 
Baseball?

1098
01:18:26,731 --> 01:18:28,824
是的，长官，这是预订的行程 
Yes sir, that's the plan.

1099
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,603
贝拉要玩棒球 ? 
Bella's gonna play baseball?

1100
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,348
好吧，祝你好运了 
Well, good luck with that.

1101
01:18:34,349 --> 01:18:35,362
我会照顾她的，我保证 
I'll take good care of her, I promise.

1102
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:43,913
你还拿着我给的防狼喷雾剂吧？ 
You still got that pepper spray?

1103
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,621
是的，爸爸 
Yeah, dad.

1104
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:53,082
什么时候吸血鬼也喜欢棒球了？ 
Since when do vampires like baseball?

1105
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:56,210
呃，那是美式消遣 
Well, it's the American pastime.

1106
01:18:56,241 --> 01:18:58,574
而且刚好有个大雷雨要来了 
And there's a thunderstorm coming.

1107
01:18:58,575 --> 01:19:00,934
那是我们唯一可以玩的时候 
It's the only time we can play.

1108
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:02,063
会知道原因的 
You'll see why.

1109
01:19:16,236 --> 01:19:18,120
我很高兴能来，因为我们需要一个裁判 
I'm glad you're here,we need an umpire.

1110
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,037
她觉得我们作弊 
She thinks we cheat.

1111
01:19:20,038 --> 01:19:21,370
我知道你会作弊 
I know you cheat.

1112
01:19:22,782 --> 01:19:25,083
看到他们作弊就喊出来，贝拉 
Call them as you see them, Bella.

1113
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:25,982
好的 
Okay.

1114
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:37,451
开始了 
It's time

1115
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:47,810
好吧，现在我知道为何你们需要打雷了 
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.

1116
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:54,586
那应该是个全垒打，对吧？ 
That's gonna be a homerun, right?

1117
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,465
爱德华速度很快 
Edward's very fast.

1118
01:20:10,428 --> 01:20:11,201
你出局了 
You're out.

1119
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:12,484
出局，哦！ 
Out! Whoo!

1120
01:20:13,757 --> 01:20:16,342
宝贝，别这样，只是场游戏罢了 
Babe, come on! It's just a game.

1121
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:22,991
很好，孩子 
Nice, kid.

1122
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,312
我的「猿人」 
My monkey-man.

1123
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:20,817
停！ 
Stop!

1124
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:39,915
他们本来要离开，但却听见了我们 
They were leaving, then they heard us.

1125
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:40,985
我们离开这吧 
Let's go.

1126
01:21:40,986 --> 01:21:42,243
太迟了 
It's too late.

1127
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,126
把的头发放下来 
Get your hair up.

1128
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:47,603
那没什么用 
Like that would help.

1129
01:21:47,604 --> 01:21:50,003
我从很远就能闻到她的气味了 
I could smell her from across the field.

1130
01:21:55,884 --> 01:21:58,544
我真不该带来这里的，很对不起.. 
I shouldn't have brought you here.I'm so sorry...

1131
01:21:58,545 --> 01:21:59,304
怎么了？ 
What?

1132
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:01,462
站在我后面别出声 
Just be quiet and stand behind me.

1133
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:25,246
我相信这是你们的吧 
I believe this belongs to you.

1134
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:29,918
谢谢 
Thank you.

1135
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,087
我叫劳伦特 
I'm Laurent

1136
01:22:32,201 --> 01:22:33,570
这是维多莉亚 
And this is Victoria

1137
01:22:35,589 --> 01:22:36,592
还有詹姆斯 
And James.

1138

这是我的家人 
This is my family.

1140
01:22:42,386 --> 01:22:43,143
你们好 
Hello.

1141
01:22:43,747 --> 01:22:47,227
我怕你们的捕猎活动会造成我们的困扰 
I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.

1142
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:48,663
很抱歉 
Our apologies.

1143
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:52,127
我们不知道这个区域已经被认领了 
We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.

1144
01:22:52,128 --> 01:22:55,631
是的，呃..我们在附近有个固定住所 
Yes, well.We maintain a permanent residence nearby.

1145
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:58,528
真的吗？ 
Really?

1146
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:04,091
好吧，我们不会再让你们困扰了 
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1147
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:06,451
我们只是路过这里而已 
We were just passing through.

1148
01:23:06,452 --> 01:23:09,693
人类在追捕我们，但我们误导他们去东边了 
The humans were tracking us but we lead them east.

1149
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:11,415
你们会安全的 
You should be safe.

1150
01:23:12,048 --> 01:23:13,028
好极了

1151
01:23:13,794 --> 01:23:15,546
那么.. 
So...

1152
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:17,678
你们可以再加三个球员吗？ 
Could you use three more players?

1153
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:22,544
喔，别这样，不过是场游戏而已 
Oh, come on. Just one game.

1154
01:23:23,245 --> 01:23:24,014
当然 
Sure,

1155
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:25,021
有何不可呢？ 
why not?

1156
01:23:25,026 --> 01:23:26,394
我们有三位正好要离开 
Three of us were leaving.

1157
01:23:26,395 --> 01:23:27,525
你们可以补上他们的位置 
You can take their place.

1158
01:23:27,526 --> 01:23:29,283
你们先投吧 
You go first.

1159
01:23:29,618 --> 01:23:32,294
我是个擅长投诡异曲球的人 
I'm the one with the wicked curve-ball.

1160
01:23:32,362 --> 01:23:34,667
嗯，我认为我们应付的来 
Well, I think we can handle that.

1161
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,378
我们走着瞧.. 
We shall see...

1162
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:00,203
你们带了点心 
You brought a snack.

1163
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:04,086
你是人类？ 
You're human?

1164
01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:08,766
这个女孩和我们是一起的 
The girl is with us.

1165
01:24:09,631 --> 01:24:11,927
我想你们最好还是离开吧 
I think it best if you leave.

1166
01:24:15,559 --> 01:24:17,233
我知道游戏结束了 
I can see the game is over.

1167
01:24:17,362 --> 01:24:19,108
我们现在就走 
We'll go now.

1168
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:23,140

1169

带贝拉离开这里...快走 
Get Bella out of here...Go.

1170
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:51,276
好啦，我知道了! 我知道了! 我没事 
Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm alright.

1171
01:24:54,252 --> 01:24:55,914
什么 ? 詹姆斯要追杀我 ? 
What? Now James is coming after me?

1172
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:08,064
听我说，詹姆斯是个追踪者 
Listen to me, James is a tracker.

1173
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:10,356
我读出他的心思，猎杀是他的嗜好 
The hunt is his obsession. I read his mind.

1174
01:25:10,357 --> 01:25:12,232
我在场地的反应刺激了他 
My reaction at the field set him off.

1175
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:15,511
我让他觉得这是他生平最刺激的游戏 
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1176
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,165
他不会就此罢手的 
He's never gonna stop.

1177
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,685
我们该怎么办 ? 
What should we do?

1178
01:25:17,984 --> 01:25:18,485
我们必须杀了他 
We have to kill him.

1179
01:25:18,486 --> 01:25:20,483
把他撕成一片片的，然后烧掉 
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1180
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:21,963
我们要去哪？ 
Where are we going?

1181
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:23,035
离开福克斯 
Away from Forks.

1182
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:24,563
我们搭渡轮去温哥华 
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.

1183
01:25:24,564 --> 01:25:26,786
我现在必须回家 !你应该带我回去 
I have to go home, now!You should take me home.

1184
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:28,048
不能回家 
You can't go home.

1185
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,033
他会从那里追踪的气味 
He's just gonna trace your scent there.

1186
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,693
那里将是他观察的首要地点 
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1187
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:33,487
但我爸爸在那 
But my dad is there.

1188
01:25:33,522 --> 01:25:34,413
那不重要！ 
It doesn't matter!

1189
01:25:34,414 --> 01:25:38,005
不，那有关系的！他可能会因为我们而死 
Yes, it does!He could get killed because of us.

1190
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:40,932
让我先带离开这里，好吗 ? 
Just let me get you out of here first, alright?

1191
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:42,393
那是我爸爸，我们必须回去 
It's my dad! We have to go back.

1192
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:44,691
我们得想办法引开他 
We'll figure how to lead the tracker

1193
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:45,653
我不知道该怎么作 
away somehow I don't know!

1194
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:46,874
但我们一定要想个办法 
But we have to do something.

1195
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:54,821
爱德华，我说了别管我！ 
Edward, I said leave me alone!

1196
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:56,113
贝拉，别这样，拜托.. 
Bella, don't do this, please...

1197
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:57,648
我们结束了，滚！ 
It's over, get out!

1198
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:59,228
嘿..嘿 ! 嘿 ! 
Hey..Hey hey!

1199
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:01,027
贝拉，怎么回事 ? 
Bella, what's going on?

1200
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:03,370
我要离开这里 
I just gotta get out of here.

1201
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:04,631
现在就走！ 
I'm leaving..Now!

1202
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,171
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1203
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,944
我要怎么对他说 ? 
What am I gonna say to him?

1204
01:26:15,362 --> 01:26:16,859
我不能伤害他 
I can't hurt him.

1205
01:26:17,562 --> 01:26:18,657
贝拉，发生什么事了 ? 
Bella, what's going on?

1206
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:19,789
你必须这么做 
You'll just have to.

1207
01:26:21,077 --> 01:26:22,359
我在卡车里等你 
I'll be down at the truck.

1208
01:26:28,457 --> 01:26:29,826
他伤害了你？ 
Did he hurt you?

1209
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:31,581
不 
No

1210
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,222
和你分手还是什么？ 
Break up with you or something?

1211
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,532
不，我...是我甩了他 
No, I... I broke up with him.

1212
01:26:40,981 --> 01:26:42,691
我以为你喜欢他 
I thought you liked him.

1213
01:26:45,475 --> 01:26:47,392
对，这就是为什么我要走 
Yeah, that's just why I have to leave.

1214
01:26:47,393 --> 01:26:49,945
我....我不想这样，我要回家 
I don't want this, I have to go home.

1215
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:55,052
家？你妈妈甚至不在凤凰城 
Home ? Your mom is not even in Phoenix.

1216
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,785
她会回来的，我在路上会打给她 
She'll come home.I'll call her from the road.

1217
01:26:57,886 --> 01:26:59,814
没必要现在开车回去 
You don't have to drive home right now.

1218
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:02,035
可以先去睡觉 
You can sleep on it.

1219
01:27:02,101 --> 01:27:04,434
如果明早还想走，我可以带去机场 
If you still feel like going in the morning, I'll take you to the airport.

1220
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:07,492
不，我想开车走，这样比较有时间思考 
No, I want to drive, it will give more time to think.

1221
01:27:07,593 --> 01:27:11,274
你放心，如果我真的累了，我会找个汽车旅馆 
If I get really tired, I'll pull into a motel.I promise.

1222
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:13,896
呃，贝拉，我知道跟我相处很无趣 
Look, Bella.I know I'm not that much fun to be around.

1223
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,265
但是.....我可以改的 
But I can change that.

1224
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:19,030
我们可以一起做很多事情的 
We can do more stuff together.

1225
01:27:21,568 --> 01:27:25,079
例如？整天盯着电视看棒球比赛？ 
Like what ? Like watch baseball on the flatscreen?

1226
01:27:26,003 --> 01:27:27,992
每晚一起吃晚饭？牛排和馅饼？ 
Eat at the dinner every night?Steak and Cobbler?

1227
01:27:28,799 --> 01:27:30,304
爸，那是你的生活..但不是我的 
Dad, that's you... That's not me.

1228
01:27:34,408 --> 01:27:37,708
贝拉，别这样，我只是..想让留下 
Bella, come on. I just... got you back.

1229
01:27:41,337 --> 01:27:43,148
是啊，你知道..如果我现在不走 
Yeah, you know... If I don't get out now,

1230
01:27:43,296 --> 01:27:45,616
我就会像妈一样永远陷在这里 
I'm just gonna be just stuck here like mom.

1231
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,381
爸爸会原谅的 
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1232
01:28:15,022 --> 01:28:16,958
让我来开吧 ? 
Why don't you let me drive?

1233
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:24,081
他不会的 
He won't.

1234
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:27,181
你没看到他的表情 
You should have seen his face.

1235
01:28:28,919 --> 01:28:30,882
我对他说了一样的话 
I told him the same thing that..

1236
01:28:30,883 --> 01:28:32,682
跟我妈离开他时说的那样 
my mom told him when she was leaving him.

1237
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:35,281
那是唯一能让你走的方法 
It was the only way he'd let you go.

1238
01:28:37,663 --> 01:28:40,479
现在先别担心他了，他很安全 
Just don't worry about him now.He's safe.

1239
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:41,709
追踪者正在跟着我们 
The tracker's following us.

1240
01:28:46,172 --> 01:28:47,201
那是艾密特 
It's just Emmett.

1241
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:51,350
艾莉丝的车跟在后面 
Alice is in the car behind us.

1242
01:29:13,785 --> 01:29:14,710
等一下 ! 
Wait!

1243
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,563
他是来警告我们关于詹姆斯的事 
He came to warn us About James.

1244
01:29:18,784 --> 01:29:19,995
这不是我引起的战争 
This isn't my fight

1245
01:29:19,996 --> 01:29:22,563
而且我早已厌倦他的游戏了 
And I've grown tired of his games.

1246
01:29:22,773 --> 01:29:25,579
但他拥有空前的感官能力，绝对是致命性的 
But he's got unparalleled senses, absolutely lethal.

1247
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,356
三百年来，我从没见过像他那么厉害的 
I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years.

1248
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:32,723
还有那个女的，维多莉亚..绝不要低估了她 
And the woman, Victoria..Don't underestimate her.

1249
01:29:37,534 --> 01:29:39,788
我以前被迫与同类作战过，很难杀的死对方 
I've had to fight our kind before.We're not easy to kill.

1250
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:40,931
但并不是不可能 
But not impossible.

1251
01:29:42,058 --> 01:29:44,174
我们会把他撕成一片片然后烧了 
We'll rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1252
01:29:44,275 --> 01:29:46,366
我并不喜好杀死另一种同类 
I don't relish the thought of killing another creature.

1253
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:48,088
即使是像詹姆斯这样残暴的 
Even a sadistic one like James.

1254
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:50,809
要是他先杀了我们其中一个呢？ 
What if he kills one of us first?

1255
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:53,566
我会带贝拉逃到南方，把追踪者引开这里 
I'm gonna run Bella south and then lead the tracker away from here.

1256
01:29:53,567 --> 01:29:55,816
不，爱德华，詹姆斯知道你不可能离开贝拉 
No, Edward. James knows you'd never leave Bella.

1257
01:29:55,817 --> 01:29:56,846
他会跟踪你的 
He'll follow you.

1258
01:29:56,864 --> 01:29:59,784
我和贝拉一起走，贾斯柏和我开车带她南下 
I'll go with Bella.Jasper and I will drive her south.

1259
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,474
我会保护她的，爱德华 
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1260
01:30:01,545 --> 01:30:03,237
你们控制得住自己吗 ? 
Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?

1261
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:04,134
是的 
Yes.

1262
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:10,566
罗丝莉...艾丝蜜 
Rosalie... Esme.

1263
01:30:10,567 --> 01:30:13,418
能请们换上这些外套... 
Could you put these on so...

1264
01:30:13,419 --> 01:30:15,971
让对方追踪贝拉的气味吗？ 
The tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1265
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:19,555
为什么？她和我是什么关系？ 
Why? What is she to me?

1266
01:30:19,777 --> 01:30:21,035
罗丝莉 
Rosalie.

1267
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:23,235
贝拉与爱德华现在是情侣 
Bella is with Edward.

1268
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:25,235
她现在是我们家族的一份子 
She is part of this family now.

1269
01:30:26,652 --> 01:30:28,876
而我们永远会保护家人 
And we protect our family.

1270
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:52,097
如果发生了什么意外，我发誓.. 
If anything happens, I swear to God...

1271
01:30:52,098 --> 01:30:53,240
不会有事的 
Nothing's gonna happen.

1272
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:55,840
我们是七个对付他们两个呢 
There's seven of us against two of them.

1273
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:57,262
等事情结束后 
And when everything's done

1274
01:30:57,263 --> 01:30:59,262
我就会去接的 
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1275
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:01,765
好的 
Yeah.

1276
01:31:02,655 --> 01:31:05,276
贝拉，从现在起就是我的生命了 
Bella, you are my life now.

1277
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,198
嘿，妈妈，又是我 
Hey, mom. It's me again.

1278
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:26,488
呃，的手机不通耶..是没电还是怎样.. 
Um, you must have let your phone die or something.

1279
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:30,904
我现在不在福克斯，但我没事，下次再跟你解释 
I'm not in Forks but everything's okay and I'll explain it later.

1280
01:31:37,717 --> 01:31:39,975
罗丝，在树群中作标记 
Rose, among the three.

1281
01:31:41,885 --> 01:31:43,314
很好 
That's good.

1282
01:32:30,814 --> 01:32:32,807
怎么了 ? 你看见什么 ? 
What is it? What did you see?

1283
01:32:44,524 --> 01:32:46,295
被他识破了 
He figured it out.

1284
01:32:46,296 --> 01:32:49,413
追踪者，他改变路线了 
The tracker. He just changed course.

1285
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:52,246
他往哪个方向了，艾莉丝 ? 
Where will it take him, Alice?

1286
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:54,458
镜子...一个全是镜子的房间 
Mirrors..A room full of mirrors.

1287
01:32:59,046 --> 01:33:01,297
艾德华说看到的不一定是正确的 
Edward said the visions weren't always certain.

1288
01:33:01,398 --> 01:33:04,780
她看到的过程必须是那个人刚好在那里 
She sees the course people are on while they're on it.

1289
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,674
如果他们改变主意了，看到的也会变 
If they change their minds, the vision changes.

1290
01:33:06,675 --> 01:33:09,374
那么，追踪者现在的路线... 
So, the course that the tracker's on now is gonna..

1291
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,262
是去一间芭蕾教室？ 
lead him to ...a ballet studio?

1292
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,731
去过？ 
You've been here?

1293
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:16,080
我小时候在那上过课 
I took lessons as a kid.

1294
01:33:16,355 --> 01:33:18,291
我去的学校有个这样的拱门 
The school I went to had an arch just like that.

1295
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,490
的学校也在凤凰城 ? 
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1296
01:33:19,491 --> 01:33:20,830
是的 
Yeah.

1297
01:33:22,452 --> 01:33:23,271
艾德华，你没事吧 ? 
Edward, you okay?

1298
01:33:23,272 --> 01:33:25,896
我们找不到追踪者，那个女的还在镇内 
We've lost the tracker.The woman's still in the area.

1299
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:28,842
罗丝莉和艾丝蜜回到福克斯去保护爸爸 
Rosalie and Esme have gone back to Forks to protect your father.

1300
01:33:28,843 --> 01:33:30,006
我马上过去找 
I'm coming to get you.

1301
01:33:30,007 --> 01:33:33,290
然后我们一起去别的地方.. 
Then you and I are gonna go somewhere.

1302
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:34,799
单独的 
Alone.

1303
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,398
其它人会继续追捕他 
And the others will keep hunting.

1304
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,544
我会不惜一切代价保护你的安全 
I'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again.

1305
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:53,675
嘿，妈！我很高兴你收到我的信息了 
Hey, mom! I'm glad you got my message.

1306
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:55,143
你在家做什么？ 
What are you doing home?

1307
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:57,985
贝拉 ! 贝拉! 贝拉 ?! 在哪儿 ? 
Bella! Bella, Bella?! Where are you?

1308
01:33:58,619 --> 01:34:00,422
冷静点，没事的 
Calm down, everything's fine.

1309
01:34:00,562 --> 01:34:01,462
贝拉 ! 
Bella!

1310
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:05,363
我晚点再跟你解释..妈，你还好吗 ? 
I'll explain everything later...Mom, are you alright?

1311
01:34:05,364 --> 01:34:07,989
福克斯高中对保护学生的隐私资料.. 
Forks High School doesn't protect

1312
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:09,288
实在不怎么样 
its students' privacy very well.

1313
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,791
让维多利亚很简单的就.. 
It was just too easy for Victoria

1314
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:13,541
找到了以前的地址 
to find your previous address.

1315
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:15,905
你住过的房子还不错 
It's a nice house you have here.

1316
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:18,260
我本来就打算好在这等来的 
I was prepared to wait for you.

1317
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:20,864
但是当妈妈接到一通 
But then mom came home after she received.

1318
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:23,141
你爸焦急的电话后就回家来了 
A very worried call from your dad.

1319
01:34:23,142 --> 01:34:26,047
一切都进展的相当顺利 
It all worked out quite well.

1320
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,164
等等 
Wait, wait...

1321
01:34:28,165 --> 01:34:29,339
别伤害她，不..！ 
Don't touch her! Don't..!

1322
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,382
还有机会救她的 
You can still save her.

1323
01:34:31,894 --> 01:34:34,343
但是必须离开的朋友们 
But you're gonna have to get away from your friends.

1324
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:35,765
能做到吗？ 
Can you handle that?

1325
01:34:36,246 --> 01:34:37,544
我去哪里见你 ? 
Where should I meet you?

1326
01:34:39,796 --> 01:34:42,081
以前的芭蕾教室如何 ? 
How about your old ballet studio?

1327
01:34:42,923 --> 01:34:45,602
如果让我发现带任何人来.. 
And I'd know if you bring anyone along..

1328
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:50,893
可怜的妈咪会为的错误付出代价的 
Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.

1329
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,978
我从来都没想过我会怎么死 
I'd never given much thought to how I would die...

1330
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,087
但如果能代替自己所爱的人而死 
But dying in the place of someone I love

1331
01:35:14,122 --> 01:35:15,680
似乎也是个正确的抉择 
seems like a good way to go.

1332
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,274
我不会因为这个让我自己.. 
I can't bring myself to regret ...

1333
01:35:26,275 --> 01:35:28,374
面对死亡的决定而感到后悔 
the decisions that brought me face to face with dead.

1334
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,813
他们也会把我带到爱德华身边 
They also brought me to Edward.

1335
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,933
贝拉! 贝拉，贝拉?!你在哪？ 
Bella! Bella, Bella?! Where are you?

1336
01:36:03,362 --> 01:36:04,562
妈妈 
Mom

1337
01:36:04,563 --> 01:36:05,662
- 贝拉? - 妈！ - 
Bella? - Mom!

1338
01:36:05,663 --> 01:36:07,729
在这啊，你在这里做什么 ? 
Here you are! What are you doing in here?

1339
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:09,310
<i>每个人都取笑我 
Everyone makes fun of me.</i>

1340
01:36:10,662 --> 01:36:12,953
<i>是个很棒的舞者 
You are a wonderful dancer.</i>

1341
01:36:13,154 --> 01:36:15,756
<i>妈妈，我糟透了 
Mom, I suck!</i>

1342
01:36:16,262 --> 01:36:19,262
<i>你一点都不糟糕 
You do not suck.</i>

1343
01:36:28,362 --> 01:36:30,322
这段是我最喜欢的部分 
That's my favorite part.

1344
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:33,618
是个固执的孩子，不是吗？ 
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?

1345
01:36:35,817 --> 01:36:37,521
她根本不在这里 
She's not even here

1346
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:45,011
抱歉，不过真的太好骗了 
Sorry..But you really made it too easy.

1347
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:49,468
所以，为了有更多的娱乐效果 
so... To make things more entertaining,

1348
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:52,061
我们来拍一点我们在一起的影片 
we are gonna make a little film of our time together.

1349
01:36:54,051 --> 01:36:57,390
我从家里带来这个，希望别介意 
I borrowed this from your house.I hope you don't mind.

1350
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:58,432
好的.. 
Okay...

1351
01:36:58,656 --> 01:37:03,218
然后 ....开始 ! 
And...Action!

1352
01:37:05,378 --> 01:37:07,148
这会让艾德华心碎的 
That will break Edward's little heart.

1353
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:09,996
艾德华跟这事无关 ! 
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1354
01:37:10,098 --> 01:37:10,390
有关系的 
He does...

1355
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:16,256
他的愤怒会让这场游戏更加有趣.. 
His rage will leave for more interesting sporthings..

1356
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,519
远比这场无力保护的游戏好玩多了 
Than this feeble attempt to protect you.

1357
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:21,241
我们继续吧 
And let's continue.

1358
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:40,730
真美...非常有视觉动感 
Beautiful... Very visually dynamic.

1359
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:44,853
我真是选对了舞台 
I chose my stage well.

1360
01:37:50,029 --> 01:37:52,769
他没勇气改造真是太糟糕了 
It's too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you.

1361
01:37:54,072 --> 01:37:56,803
却让停留在弱小的人类 
Instead he kept you this fragile little human.

1362
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,255
这可真是残忍 
It's cruel, really.

1363
01:38:03,103 --> 01:38:04,987
跟他说为报仇吧 
Tell him to avenge you.

1364
01:38:05,999 --> 01:38:07,781
告诉他为报仇！说！ 
Tell him to avenge you! Tell him!

1365
01:38:07,782 --> 01:38:08,730
艾德华，不要 ! 
Edward, don't!

1366
01:38:09,262 --> 01:38:09,962
告诉他！ 
Tell him!

1367
01:38:23,202 --> 01:38:26,683
你落单了..因为你比其它人都快 
You're alone...cause you're faster than the others.

1368
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:30,203
但不够强壮 
But not stronger.

1369
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:34,221
我强到能杀了你 
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1370
01:38:41,286 --> 01:38:42,474
很抱歉 
I'm sorry.

1371
01:39:46,059 --> 01:39:47,862
贝拉，贝拉 ! 没事了 
Bella, Bella! It's okay.

1372
01:39:47,863 --> 01:39:48,602
孩子.. 
Son..

1373
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:52,505
够了，别失去了你的本性 
Enough! Remember who you are.

1374
01:39:58,893 --> 01:40:00,784
贝拉需要你 
Bella needs you.

1375
01:40:03,067 --> 01:40:04,277
哦，天啊 
Oh God.

1376
01:40:08,151 --> 01:40:10,121
卡莱尔 ! 这血... 
Carlisle! The blood..

1377
01:40:10,122 --> 01:40:11,683
你的兄弟们会解决他的 
Your brothers will take care of it.

1378
01:40:12,342 --> 01:40:14,115
用地上的木板生火 
Start the fire with the floor boards.

1379
01:40:16,169 --> 01:40:17,100
艾莉丝 ! 
Alice!

1380
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:18,218
艾莉丝，快 
Alice, go.

1381
01:40:27,924 --> 01:40:30,391
她的股动脉被割伤了，正在大量出血 
Her femoral artery has been savaged. She's losing too much blood.

1382
01:40:30,392 --> 01:40:32,245
不，不，我的手...烧起来了! 
No, no, my hand... Is burning!

1383
01:40:33,805 --> 01:40:35,298
那是毒液的关系 
It's the venom.

1384
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:39,135
为了不让她转化，你必须做个选择 
You have to make a choice to prevent the change happen.

1385
01:40:39,962 --> 01:40:42,514
不.. 
No..

1386
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:43,284
不！ 
No!

1387
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,006
这会发生的，艾德华，我预见到了 
It's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.

1388
01:40:47,007 --> 01:40:48,814
不一定非要这样做 
It doesn't have to be that way.

1389
01:40:48,815 --> 01:40:50,095
她还在出血..，艾莉丝 
She's still hemorrhaging..Alice

1390
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:51,863
把的皮带给我当止血带 
Make me a tourniquet with your belt.

1391
01:40:51,864 --> 01:40:54,529
卡莱尔，我还有其它选择吗 ? 
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1392
01:40:55,205 --> 01:40:56,747
把它绑在我的手上 
Tie it above my hands.

1393
01:40:57,278 --> 01:40:58,985
卡莱尔 ! 
Carlisle!

1394
01:41:00,612 --> 01:41:02,219
快 
Go.

1395
01:41:06,816 --> 01:41:08,170
试着把毒液吸出来 
To try to suck the venom out.

1396
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:09,584
你知道我可能没办法停下来的 
You know I won't be able to stop.

1397
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:11,772
那就用你的意志力..去阻止 
Then find the will..To stop.

1398
01:41:12,536 --> 01:41:15,621
快点决定，她没几分钟可活了 
But choose. She only has minutes left.

1399
01:41:18,362 --> 01:41:20,431
我不会让离开我的，贝拉 
I can't make you go away, Bella.

1400
01:41:22,962 --> 01:41:25,129
但我会让痛苦离开的 
But I'll make it go away.

1401
01:41:43,321 --> 01:41:44,823
艾德华，停下来 ! 
Edward, stop!

1402
01:41:44,824 --> 01:41:47,215
血已经干净了，再下去你会杀死她的 
The blood is clean, you're killing her.

1403
01:41:48,048 --> 01:41:51,154
爱德华，停下来 ! 
Edward, stop!

1404
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:55,938
快停下来，意志力要坚定 
Stop. Find the will.

1405
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:24,259
死亡是那么安详.. 简单.. 
Dead is peaceful... Easy..

1406
01:42:31,462 --> 01:42:33,011
活着却是如此困难 
Life is harder.

1407
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:40,067
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1408
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:43,462
宝贝？ 
Baby?

1409
01:42:45,162 --> 01:42:46,362
贝拉 ? 
Bella?

1410
01:42:47,462 --> 01:42:48,462
妈妈… 
Mom...

1411
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:50,162
嘿… 
Hey...

1412
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:54,837
他在哪里 ? 在哪..爱德华在哪儿 ? 
Where is he? Where's... Where is Edward?

1413
01:42:54,838 --> 01:42:56,486
他睡着了 
He's asleep.

1414
01:42:57,741 --> 01:42:59,308
他一直没离开过 
He never leaves.

1415
01:42:59,309 --> 01:43:01,498
而爸爸在楼下的餐厅 
And your dad is down at the cafeteria.

1416
01:43:02,837 --> 01:43:04,940
发生了甚么事 ? 
What happened?

1417
01:43:04,941 --> 01:43:07,226
呃，跌倒的时候，摔断了腿 
Well, when you fell you broke your leg.

1418
01:43:08,703 --> 01:43:10,602
而且流了很多血 
And you lost a lot of blood.

1419
01:43:11,515 --> 01:43:13,579
一点都不记得了吗？ 
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1420
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,713
艾德华和他父亲 
Edward came down with his dad

1421
01:43:17,714 --> 01:43:19,713
试着要劝回去福克斯 
to try to convince to come back to Forks.

1422
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:22,714
所以去他们饭店时，就这么滑倒了.. 
So you went over to their hotel and you tripped..

1423
01:43:23,806 --> 01:43:26,009
摔下两段楼梯 
And fell down two flights of stairs.

1424
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,534
还撞破了玻璃窗 
And through a window!

1425
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,641
是的，那听起来蛮像我的 
Yeah, it sounds like me.

1426
01:43:36,642 --> 01:43:39,207
哦，亲爱的，我很抱歉 
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

1427
01:43:43,058 --> 01:43:43,969
是费尔 
It's Phil.

1428
01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:46,774
他很担心 
He's so worried about you.

1429
01:43:48,674 --> 01:43:49,989
会发简讯了? 
You're texting?

1430
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,978
是啊，终于会了 
Finally, yeah.

1431
01:43:53,244 --> 01:43:55,350
我要他留在佛罗里达 
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1432
01:43:55,351 --> 01:43:57,741
哦，亲爱的，会喜欢杰克逊维尔州的 
Oh, honey. You are gonna love Jacksonville.

1433
01:43:57,751 --> 01:43:59,531
那里每天都阳光明媚 
It's sunny everyday day.

1434
01:44:00,009 --> 01:44:01,553
而且我们找到了一间很可爱的房子 
And we found the cutest little house

1435
01:44:01,559 --> 01:44:03,053
会有自己的浴室 
and you've got your own bathroom

1436
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:05,065
不，妈妈，我还是想住在福克斯镇 
No, Mom. I still wanna live in Forks.

1437
01:44:06,151 --> 01:44:07,199
什么？ 
What?

1438
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:09,224
我想住在福克斯 
I wanna live in Forks.

1439
01:44:09,825 --> 01:44:13,289
呃，好吧，我们再说吧 
Well, okay. We'll talk about it.

1440
01:44:13,405 --> 01:44:15,880
介意去找一下爸爸吗？ 
Do you mind getting dad?

1441
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,097
我有话要跟他说，跟他道歉 
I have to talk to him. Apologize.

1442
01:44:20,358 --> 01:44:22,874
好的，宝贝，我去叫他 
Okay, baby.I'll go get him.

1443
01:44:23,262 --> 01:44:25,532
我也会找护士过来的，好吗 ? 
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?

1444
01:44:25,567 --> 01:44:26,571
好的 
Okay.

1445
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:41,665
发生了甚么事 ? 詹姆斯哪里去了 ? 
What happened? Where is James?

1446
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,376
我们摆平他了 
We took care of him.

1447
01:44:51,342 --> 01:44:53,811
而那个女的，维多莉亚，她逃走了 
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.

1448
01:44:54,523 --> 01:44:56,368
都是因为你我才能活着 
I'm alive because of you.

1449
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:59,748
不，是因为我才沦落成这样的 
No, you're in here because of me.

1450
01:45:00,673 --> 01:45:04,330
最糟糕的是.. 
The worst part of it was...

1451
01:45:04,331 --> 01:45:06,796
我以为我没办法停止 
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1452
01:45:07,331 --> 01:45:08,692
可是你停下来了 
You did stop.

1453
01:45:10,113 --> 01:45:12,850
贝拉，应该去杰克森维尔的 
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville,

1454
01:45:12,851 --> 01:45:14,946
这样我就不会再伤害了 
So I can't hurt you anymore.

1455
01:45:16,504 --> 01:45:17,816
什么？ 
What?

1456
01:45:21,862 --> 01:45:24,366
不，不！ 
No, no!

1457
01:45:25,427 --> 01:45:27,620
我甚至都不知道你...怎么会.. 
I don't even know what you're...how..?

1458
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:29,520
..你到底在说什么? 
What are you talking about?

1459
01:45:29,521 --> 01:45:31,521
你希望我走吗？..不...我不能 
You want me to go away?..no..I can't..

1460
01:45:31,522 --> 01:45:33,449
我..我不能离开你.. 
I...I can't ..I can't just leave you.

1461
01:45:33,451 --> 01:45:34,785
我知道了 
I know.

1462
01:45:36,635 --> 01:45:39,932
我们不能分开，你不能离开我 
We can't be apart. You can't leave me.

1463
01:45:40,391 --> 01:45:42,567
我会在这的 
I'm here.

1464
01:45:45,594 --> 01:45:50,800
好了，你不准再对我说那种话了 
Okay. You just can't just say stuff like that to me.

1465
01:45:50,814 --> 01:45:51,800
永远 
Ever.

1466
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:59,313
哪里还有...我的容身之处呢？ 
Where else...am I gonna go?

1467
01:46:47,393 --> 01:46:49,597
呃，艾莉丝借给我的礼服 
Alice lent me the dress.

1468
01:46:50,197 --> 01:46:51,686
款式很.. 
The cast is..

01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:54,186
无可挑剔 
Perfect.

1470

我会照顾她的，史旺警长 
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.

1471
01:47:00,163 --> 01:47:02,384
呃，这句话好像有听你说过 
Uhu. I've heard that before.

1472
01:47:07,417 --> 01:47:08,836
嘿，贝拉 
Hey, Bells.

1473
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:12,736
我在包包里放了一罐新的防狼喷雾剂 
I put a new can of Pepper spray on your bag.

1474
01:47:12,936 --> 01:47:13,896
爸爸..

1475
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:16,097
还有...呃..

你也是 
You too

1484
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:48,314
你是来舞会捣乱的？ 
Are you crashing the prom or something?

1485
01:47:48,315 --> 01:47:50,214
还是和舞伴一起来的？ 
Did you come with a date?

1486
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,329
不 
No.

1487
01:47:55,613 --> 01:47:58,210
我爸付钱让我来跟你说话 
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1488

有20块美金呢 
Twenty bucks.

1489
01:48:00,463 --> 01:48:02,054
说来听听 
Let's hear it.

1490
01:48:03,122 --> 01:48:04,613
先别生气，好吗 
Just don't get mad, okay?

1491
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:09,266
他希望跟男朋友分手 
He wants you to break up with your boyfriend.

1492
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,868
他只是....他说
He's just ...He said,

1493
01:48:12,869 --> 01:48:14,314
引用他的话 
quote:

1494
01:48:14,315 --> 01:48:16,143
「我们会看着你的」 
"We'll be watching you."

1495
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:20,562
- 好啦，跟他说谢谢 - 好的.. 
- Okay. Well, tell him thanks.-Okay...

1496
01:48:21,426 --> 01:48:22,562
- 去拿钱吧 - 嗯

1497

喔，让我帮吧

1498
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:25,162
雅各布 
Jacob

1499
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:27,837
我来就可以了 
I'll take it from here.

1500
01:48:31,518 --> 01:48:33,393
我会常来看的，贝拉 
I guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1501
01:48:43,947 --> 01:48:47,843
我只离开你2分钟，狼人就趁虚而入了 
I leave you alone for two minutes and the wolves descend.

1502
01:48:54,462 --> 01:48:56,950
我不敢相信你真的让我来参加舞会了 
I can't believe you're making me do this.

1503
01:48:56,951 --> 01:48:58,271
笑一个 
Smile.

1504
01:49:18,508 --> 01:49:20,839
哇喔 ! 你还真想害死我呢 
Wow! You are really trying to kill me.

1505
01:49:21,256 --> 01:49:23,055
舞会是进行的一个重要仪式 
Prom is an important rite of passage.

1506
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:25,169
我不希望错过任何过程 
I don't want you to miss anything.

1507
01:49:53,662 --> 01:49:54,862
贝拉!
