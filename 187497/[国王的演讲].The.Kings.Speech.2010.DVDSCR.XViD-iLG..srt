约翰逊先生没来
Where's Mr Johnson?

我过来没告诉他
He doesn't know I'm here.

76
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,420
这么开始治疗  前景不光明啊
That's not a very promising start.

没错  我丈夫做过的治疗都没效果  他已经放弃了

换不了啊
He can't.

85

91
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,260
对不起  大夫
Doctor, forgive me.

92
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,770
我丈夫不是普通的“老公”  也不随便“转转”
I do not have a “hubby”. We don't ‘pop'.

93
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,280
我们也不会谈论个人隐私情况

需要你去拜访我们才行

108
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,920
看来我也算敌人喽？
Am I considered the enemy?

109
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,700
要是你还这么不近人情的话…
You will be if you remain un-obliging.

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,030
你对此保密十分重要

我警告她说，这两个词我可不爱听

你得一直坐这里傻呆着，听大人唠叨完

要是不好说，就别提呗

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,810
飞走了！
Oh, to fly away!

150
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,770
多好啊
Weren't they lucky!

151
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,420
爸爸也给讲个故事！
Now Papa tell a story!

152
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,680
我还是装企鹅陪你们玩吧？
Could I be a penguin instead?

153
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,790
我要听企鹅的故事
Now I want to a penguin story.

154
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,400
来个短的
Very quickly

155
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,720
从前有两个公主
Once there were two princesses

156
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,080
伊丽莎白和玛格丽特公主
Princesses Elisabeth, and Princesses Margret

157
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,760
她们爸爸是个企鹅
Their papa was a penguin

158
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,340
因为一个邪恶的女巫诅咒了他
This was because he been turned into by a wicked witch

159
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,480
这对他来说可不算方便
This was inconvenient for him because he loved

160
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,440
因为他想要抱着小公主们
to hold his princesses in his arms

161
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,610
可企鹅抱不了
and you can't do that if you're a penguin,

162
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,290
因为他的翅膀就像鲱鱼一样
because you have wings like herrings.

163
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,360
鲱鱼没翅膀啊
Herrings don't have wings.

164
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,060
是他的翅膀形状像鲱鱼
Penguins have wings which like the shape of herrings.

165
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,350
更糟的是，女巫把他流放到了南极
And what make matters worse she sent him to the South Pole

166
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,970
要是不能飞的话，回来可是老远的路
which is an awfully long walk back if you can't fly.

167
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,890
不过当他跳进水里
When he reached the water

168
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,850
潜进去，发现在水里能游的飞快
He dived in, through the depth so fast

169
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,410
午饭的时间就游到了南安普顿
that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

170
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,550
先到惠桥那里，又在克拉彭改了方向
From there he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction

171
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,340
还向野鸭打听了回白金汉宫的路线
and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.

172
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,520
游过了泰晤士河，从出水口跳了出来
He swam up the Thames and out through the plughole,

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,200
把正做饭的妈妈和惠特克夫人吓了一跳
giving the cook mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.

174
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,070
女孩们听到吵闹声
When the girls heard all the commotion

175
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,040
就跑到了厨房，她们给他…
They run to the kitchen where they gave him

176
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,630
擦干净，喂吃的，还吻了他
a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

177
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,520
你们知道吻他的时候，他变成什么了？
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?

178
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,680
一个英俊的王子！
A handsome prince!

179
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,480
一个短尾巴的信天翁
A short-tailed Albatross.

180
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,990
不过翅膀大到可以把女儿们好好的抱住
With wings big enough that he could wrap them both around his two girls together

181
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,810
好了，去睡觉吧
Now girls, time for bed. Come on

182
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,830
把小马牵到马厩里
Take the horses to the stable

183
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,380
一分钟后弄好啊
You have exactly a minute

184
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,570
晚安
Good night

185
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,260
喂草清理后就去睡觉
feed them brush them and to bed.

186
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,140
辛普森太太也在吗？
Will Mrs Simpson be there?

187
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,080
我哥哥坚持让她来
My brother's insisting.

188
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,820
他是认真的？
Is he serious?

189
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,180
是说请我们吃饭？
About our coming to dinner?

190
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,480
不。我是问对她的感情
No. About her!

191
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,800
一个结婚的女人？不太可能
A married woman? He can't be.

192
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,310
她倒有可能。对了，我找到个有意思的人选
She can. By the way I think I found someone rather interesting.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,670
在哈雷大街，一个大夫
On Harley Street. A doctor.

194
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,660
这绝对不行。我不再和你讨论这事儿了
Out of the question. I'm not having this conversation again.

195
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,870
肯定没戏
The matter's settled.

196
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,240
他的治疗方法很特别…
His approach seems rather different....

197
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,670
开始？
Now?

198
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:28,900
开始！
Now!

199
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,850
“现在我们严冬般的宿怨…”
（莎士比亚戏剧《理查三世》第一场）
“Now is the winter of our discontent

200
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,840
给这颗约克的红日照耀成为夏景
（莎士比亚戏剧《理查三世》第一场）
Made glorious summer by this sun of York.”

201
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,470
那笼罩我们王室的愁云…
（理查此番演说表达了嫉妒篡位的野心）
“And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house

202
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
都埋进了海洋深处。
（理查此番演说表达了嫉妒篡位的野心）
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

203
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,690
现在我们额前已经戴上了胜利的花环…
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;

204
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,410
谢谢
Thank you.

205
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,160
试演的不错，您是…
Lovely diction, Mr...

206
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,950
罗格，莱诺·罗格
Logue. Lionel Logue.

207
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,650
好吧，罗格先生
Well, Mr Logue,

208
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,130
我没感受到想当皇帝到心里扭曲的灵魂呐喊
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.

209
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,420
也没感受到理查三世的领袖风范
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.

210
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,660
台词我都会背
I do know all the lines.

211
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,190
我以前演过的
I've played the role before.

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,980
- 在悉尼？
- 佩斯市（澳大利亚城市）
- Sydney? - Perth.

213
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,320
- 喜欢戏剧的小镇，是吧？
- 大家都很热情
- Major theater town, is it? - Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,330
- 哦
- 我很受好评的
- Ah. - I was well reviewed.

215
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,650
那…个…莱诺
Yes...well...Lionel,

216
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,500
我想对于我们剧团来说，您的…
I think our dramatic society is looking for

217
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,490
…年龄大了点
someone slightly younger

218
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,830
也缺点儿王者风范
and a little more regal.

219
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,700
要把最外面的先关上
You have to shut that one first.

220
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,200
关了第一扇门才行
Close that one first, that

221
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,910
你怎么找到这个…医师的？
Where did you find this...physician?

222
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,270
来源保密，线人在谢德集市的法国造型小店旁边
Classifieds, next to “French model, Shepherd's Market”.

223
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,500
这人强力推荐他
He comes highly recommended.

224
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,210
收费不少，用来帮助穷人
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.

225
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,260
哎呀，难不成是个共党分子？
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!

226
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,300
他没接待员，说是凡事从简
He has no receptionist. He likes to keep things simple.

227
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,820
约翰逊一家来了
The Johnsons.

228
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,270
你能进去了，约翰逊先生
You can go in now, “Mr. Johnson”.

229
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,590
莱诺说，您可以在这里等着，夫人
Lionel says...wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.

230
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,490
天气这…这么好，也可以…
Or, it being a p-pleasant day,

231
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,150
…出…出去散步
p-perhaps take a stroll.

232
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,520
这样行么，莱诺？
Was that alright...Lionel?

233
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,380
非常好，威利！
Marvellous, Willy

234
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,670
你可以在这儿等你妈妈
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

235
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,980
约翰逊夫人。先生，请进
Mrs Johnson. Mr.Johnson, do come in.

236
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,040
想要吃糖吗？
Would you like a sweetie

237
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
威利这小伙不错
He's a good lad, Willy.

238
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,010
刚开始过来时
He could hardly make a sound, you know,

239
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,580
他都发不出声来
when he first came to me.

240
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,590
我儿子们做的，还不错吧？
My boys made those. Good, aren't they.

241
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,480
请随便坐
Please, make yourself comfortable.

242
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,780
我听说不能坐的太近
I was told not not to sit too close.

243
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,430
还有说话的时候，要让王子先选择话题
when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.

244
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,290
等着我…才…才开始
Waiting for me to… commence a conversation

245
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,680
那可要等上很久
one can wait a rather long wait.

246
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,350
那么就讲些笑话？
Do you know any jokes?

247
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,480
把握节奏…我可不擅长
Timing isn't my strong suit.

248
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,430
来杯茶？
Cuppa tea?

249
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,920
不了，谢谢
No thank you.

250
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,890
我来一杯吧
I think I'll have one.

251
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,580
罗格医生，你不该开始治疗了吗？
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?

252
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,460
你真正愿意配合了，我才开始
Only if you're interested in being treated.

253
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,210
叫我莱诺就好
Please, call me Lionel.

254
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,110
我还是称呼你医生吧
I… I prefer Doctor.

255
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,110
我喜欢莱诺这名儿。怎么称呼您？
I prefer Lionel. What'll I call you?

256
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,860
尊贵的殿下，然后说公爵
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.

257
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,790
太正式了点，还是叫名字吧
A bit formal for here. I prefer names

258
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,980
阿尔伯特·福德里克·亚瑟·乔治王子？
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?

259
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,120
叫伯蒂好么？
How about Bertie?

260
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,030
我家人才能这么说
Only my family uses that.

261
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,180
那正好了，在这儿，我们最好是平等关系
Perfect. In here, it's better if we're equals.

262
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,400
和你一样的话，我就不会来了
If we were equal.. I wouldn't be here.

263
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:33,090
我陪陪家人就行，没人管我结巴的事儿
I'd be.. at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.

264
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,110
请别这样
Please don't do that.

265
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,910
怎么？
I'm sorry?

266
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,060
这样吸烟就是自己找死
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.

267
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,210
我的医生说烟能放松喉部
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.

268
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,730
一群笨蛋
They're idiots.

269
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,160
他们可是受过爵位的医生
They've all been knighted.

270
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,940
那就是官方的笨蛋了
Makes it official then.

271
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,250
我的城堡，我来做主
My 'castle', my rules.

272
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,180
麻烦了
Thank you

273
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,610
你最早的回忆是什么？
What was your earliest memory?

274
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,680
什么乱七八糟的
What an earth do you mean?

275
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,230
你最先记起的事儿
Your first recollection.

276
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,900
我不是来…
I'm not…

277
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,300
…来讨论个人隐私的
here to discuss personal matters.

278
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,920
那您干什么来了？
Why're you here then?

279
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,670
因为我非常的结巴！
Because I bloody well stammer!

280
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,620
脾气很烈嘛
You have a bit of a temper.

281
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,510
我的缺点之一
One of my many faults.

282
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,250
什么时候开始结巴的？
When did the defect start?

283
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,910
我从小就这样！
I've always been this way!

284
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,080
我很怀疑
I doubt that.

285
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,500
别…别和我争！是我结巴！
Don't.. tell me! It's my stammer!

286
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,130
我研究这领域，我保证…
It's my field. I assure you,

287
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,060
没有小孩生下来就是结巴的
no infant starts to speak with a stammer.

288
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,530
什么时候开始的？
When did it start?

289
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,540
四五岁吧
Four or five.

290
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,990
这很典型
That's typical.

291
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,510
其他人也这么说
So I've been told.

292
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,710
我印象里就没有不结巴的时候
I can't remember not doing it.

293
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,800
这我相信。想事儿的时候会结巴吗？
I can believe that. Do you hesitate when you think?

294
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,510
别开玩笑了
Don't be ridiculous.

295
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,510
自言自语的时候呢？
How about when you talk to yourself?

296
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,350
每个人都有嘟囔的时候，伯蒂
Everyone natters occasionally, Bertie.

297
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,020
别这么叫我！
Stop calling me that!

298
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,660
我不会叫你其他名字了
I'm not going to call you anything else.

299
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,130
那咱们谈话结束
Then we shan't speak!

300
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,020
大夫，咨询也要收钱的吧？
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

301
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,960
一大笔呢
A fortune.

302
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,980
茶待会喝
I'll just save that brew

303
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,470
那你自言自语的时候，结巴吗？
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?

304
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,320
当然不会！
Of course not!

305
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,950
这说明你的缺陷不是不可改变的
That proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.

306
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,380
你觉得病因是什么？
What do you think was the cause?

307
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,470
我怎么知道！我…我也不关心！
I don't know! I… don't care!

308
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,930
我结巴，没人能治得好
I stammer. And no one can fix it.

309
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,990
我打赌，你在这儿就能流畅的阅读
I'll bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.

310
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,950
如果我赌赢了，我要继续问你些问题
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.

311
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,250
要是我赢？
And if I win?

312
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,960
你可以不回答么
You don't have to answer them.

313
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,520
一般…都是赌钱的
One usually… wagers money.

314
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,480
赌注一先令，赌个意思？你的钱呢
A bob each to keep it sweet? Let's see your shilling.

315
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,510
我…我…随身不带钱
I don't… carry money.

316
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,830
我就觉得你会这么说
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

317
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,000
我帮你下注，下回还给我就好
I'll stake you. And you can pay me back next time.

318
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,980
如果还有下回的话
If there is a next time.

319
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,270
我也没确定要继续治疗你
I haven't agreed to take you on yet

320
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,810
请站起来，读读这段，从这里
So please stand, and take a look at that, from there

321
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,990
这我读不了
I can't read this.

322
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,100
你试都不试，先输我一先令了
Then you owe me a shilling for not trying.

323
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:13,660
“生…生…存还是毁灭”
（莎士比亚《哈姆雷特》）
“To.. to..be or not to be,

324
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,970
“这是……”     见鬼
That… is..”  damn

325
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
我还没完呢
I haven't finished yet.

326
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,480
下面我要录下你的声音
I'm going to record your voice

327
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,190
回头用这台机器重放给你听
And then play it back to you on the same machine.

328
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,220
这可是来自美国的先进发明，银嗓牌留声机
This is brilliant. It's the latest thing from America :a Silvertone.

329
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,750
戴上试试？
Pop these on?

330
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,030
有赌注哦，回家就能发大财了！
There's a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich!

331
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,130
- 你在放音乐
- 没错
- You're playing music. - I know.

332
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,290
那我怎么听到我说什么？
How can I hear what I'm saying?!

333
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,610
相信殿下的聪明头脑会控制自己嘴巴的
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?

334
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,950
看起来你好像不太了解王子殿下啊
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

335
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,010
生存还是毁灭…这是一个值得考虑的问题
to be or not to be.. that is the question

336
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,950
我没救了，没救了！
Hopeless. Hopeless!

337
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,240
您念得相当好啊
You were sublime.

338
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,250
我会当着王子的面撒谎吗？就为了赢12便士？
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?

339
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,040
我可是猜不到一个澳大利亚人要点英国小钱干嘛
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.

340
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,700
- 我放给你听
- 不用了
- let me play it back to you - No.

341
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,920
那也行，我再问你些问题
Alright then, I'll get to ask you the questions.

342
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,710
不麻烦了，这个疗法…不太适合我
Thank you Doctor, I don't… feel this is for me.

343
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,350
占用你的时间了，再见
Thank you for your time. Bye

344
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,730
公爵？
Sir?

345
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,510
录音是免费的
The recording is free.

346
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,480
您留作纪念吧
Please keep it as a souvenir?

347
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,810
没戏
No

348
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,190
那算了
Ah well.

349
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,350
这倔脾气！
bugger

（1934年圣诞广播，国王乔治五世）
King George V.Christmas Broadcast 1934,

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,150
眼前的任务…
（桑德林姆宫，诺福克市）
For the present(Sandringham House,Norfolk)

352
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,700
由我们共同承担
the work to which we are all equally bound,

353
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,400
努力寻求边疆的…
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility...

354
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,230
…充分安定，在萧条的形势下重获国家繁荣
...within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking

355
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:42,160
不再自私自利，努力帮助那些过去几年受苦的人们
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.

356
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,310
我祝你们每一个人，圣诞快乐
To all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.

357
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,860
上帝保佑你们
God bless you.

358
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,140
直播结束
And off air

359
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,950
知道窍门了就简单了
Easy when you know how.

360
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,710
陛下？
Sir?

361
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,770
你也试试
Have a go yourself.

362
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,250
恭喜您，陛下
Congratulations, Sir.

363
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
伍德先生，了不起的年轻人
Ah, Mr Wood. Splendid fellow.

364
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,490
小伙子告诉我制胜的窍门：
Chap taught me everything I know:

365
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,440
让麦克风自然引导自己
let the microphone do the work.

366
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,970
陛下
Sir.

367
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
谢谢
Thank you.

368
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,260
坐正了，挺起腰
Sit up, straight back,

369
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,080
瞪大眼睛盯着这讲稿
face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare its quare in the eye,

370
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,820
就像正派的英国人一样
as you would any decent Englishman.

371
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,540
给它点颜色看看
Show who's in command.

372
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,620
爸爸，我…我…读不了这个
Papa I don't…think I read this

373
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,900
你念不了的话，这邪恶的机器就会毁了你
This devilish device will change everything if you won't.

374
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,320
以前的国王只需要稳坐在马背上，表现得体就好
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.

375
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,460
现在，我们必须去主动迎合大众的需要
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.

376
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,300
王室家族的角色改变
This family has been reduced to those lowest

377
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,730
我们成为了最卑微的存在…成了演员
beast of all creatures...we've become...actors!

378
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,140
我想我们不是一个家族，更像个公司
we're not a family, we're a firm.

379
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,670
没错，任何时候都可能有人失业
Yet any moment some of us may be out of work.

380
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,690
你这活宝哥哥，未来的国王
Your darling brother... and future king

381
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,030
唯一想娶的女人就是别人的老婆！
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!

382
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,560
他已经和弗内斯女士分手了
He's broken off with Lady Furness.

383
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,070
又勾搭上辛普森夫人，她两个丈夫还都活得好好的！
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!

384
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,990
我明确警告过他，宫廷不接受离过婚的人
I told him straight no divorced person can ever be received at court.

385
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,970
他说她让他由衷的开心
He said she made him sublimely happy.

386
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,400
我觉得这是因为他们睡过觉了吧
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.

387
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,000
“我向你保证”他说
“I give you my word” this is what he said

388
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,480
“我保证，我们没有不道德的行为发生”
“I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations,”

389
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,670
看着他父亲的眼睛，瞪着眼…
Stared square into his father's eyes...

390
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,580
说瞎话！
and lied.

391
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,850
我过世以后，这小子肯定会毁了自己，毁了家庭
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family,

392
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,520
一年之内毁了这个国家
and this nation, within twelve months.

393
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,100
谁来收拾烂摊子？
Who'll pick up the pieces?

394
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,410
是希特勒，威胁着半个欧洲
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe,

395
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,410
还是斯大林，威胁另一半的？
Marshall Stalin the other half?

396
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,430
谁来控制局面？马靴军队？
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots,

397
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,240
无产阶级深渊？还是你？
and the proletarian abyss? You?

398
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,030
你的大哥这么逃避责任
With your older brother shirking his duties,

399
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,410
你以后可不止演讲这点困难
you're going to have to do a lot more of this.

400
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,910
努力再试试
Have a go yourself.

Relax! Just try it!

给我说！
Do it!

410
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,650
这江湖骗子
Lying bastard.

411
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,360
- 你在放音乐
- 没错
- You're playing music. - I know.

412
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,900
那我怎么听到我说什么？
How can I hear what I'm saying?!

相信殿下的聪明头脑会控制自己嘴巴的
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?

414
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,520
看起来你好像不太了解王子殿下啊
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?

415
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,810
“生存还是毁灭，这是一个值得考虑的问题”
“To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -

或是挺身反抗人世的无涯的苦难
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

419
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,970
通过斗争把它们扫清
And by opposing end them..

420
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,840
死了，睡着了，什么都完了
To die, to sleep no more

421

要是在这一种睡眠之中
And by a sleep to say we end

422
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,320
我们心头的创痛，其他无数血肉之躯…
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks

所不能避免的打击，都可以从此消失…”
That flesh is heir to? ‘tis a consummation…”

424
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,480
我没救了，没救了！
Hopeless! Hopeless!

425
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,800
只谈正事儿，不…不谈隐私之类的废话
Strictly business. No.. personal nonsense.

426
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,620
我不是上次说的很清楚了吗？
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.

427
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,430
欠我的钱带来了吗？
Got the shilling you owe me?

428
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,210
没有
No I haven't

429
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,650
别想赖账
Didn't think so.

430
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,720
而且，你…是用花招骗了我
Besides, you…tricked me!

431
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,360
身体训练和花招窍门都很重要
Physical exercises and tricks are important

432
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,460
不过你这样要求，我只能治疗病的皮毛
But what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.

433
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,740
这样够吗？不够
Is that that's sufficient? Ah, no.

434
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,750
就我观察来看，我丈夫身体确实有说话的障碍
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.

435
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,370
先治疗这部分好了
Maybe just deal with that.

436

我愿意努力配合治疗，罗格医生
I..I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...

你愿意尽力治疗吗？
Are you… willing to do your part?

439
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,050
当然。你要治疗身体？
Alright. You want mechanics?

440
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,420
我们需要放松你下巴的肌肉
加强舌头的锻炼
We need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue.

441
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,770
通过绕口令之类的练习，比如
By repeating tongue twisters for example.

444
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,170
还有个没筛好蓟草的筛子

445

因为我要筛蓟草”

446
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,930
好的

447

你的肚子软囊囊的

448
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,450
我们要花时间锻炼你的胸膈膜

得先给我一先令的钱
And that's about a shilling's worth.

452

别惦记着你走运赌赢的钱了！
Forget about the blessed shilling!

453
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,720
可能…在有些场合
Perhaps, upon occasion,

454
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,820
需要你的亲自协助
You might be request to assistance…

455

如果有…演讲活动的话

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,890
你同意这样的安排吗
Will that be agreeable?

457
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,670
没问题
Of course.

458
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,350
你的职责仅限于此了
That will be the full extent of your services.

459
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,290
我下周来找你？

深呼吸，扩张胸部
Take a nice deep breath, expand the chest

466

把手放到肋骨上
Put your hands on your ribs

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,030
深吸气，好
Deeper, good

468
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,550
有什么感觉？
How do you feel?

469
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,150
肺里充满热空气
Full of hot air.

470
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,870
公众演讲不就是这感觉吗
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?

471
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,980
“我和妻子很高兴能来到这家重要的…”

深呼吸，提气。殿下

慢慢吐气，收回来。殿下

474
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,790
- 感觉还行，伯蒂？

475
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,100
其实这挺好玩的

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmother.

477
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,080
逐渐缩短哼声的时间
Short the humming each time

478
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,590
工厂…在这个地区…
（“工厂”用到了“母亲”的辅音）

489
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,450
只要能大声对着窗外喊出元音，
就肯定能开口演讲
Anyone who can shout vowels in an open window can learn to deliver a speech.

我的嘴怎么不行
mine doesn't bloody work

493
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,540
加油，再试一次，伯蒂
come on, one more time, Bertie

494
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,740
你能行的

500
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,440
- 现在常出来玩？
- 没这习惯

等了很久？我的天，这么冷
Been waiting long? For Christ, bloody freezing

502
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,160
你去哪儿了？
Where've you been?

503
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,830
到处忙
Been busy.

504
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,120
我也是，伊丽莎白得了肺炎
So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.

505
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,800
我很难过。不过她会好的
I'm sorry. She'll recover.

506
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,360
父亲不会
Father won't.

507
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,850
我来开车
I'll drive.

508
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,830
老家伙肯定是有意这么做的
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

509
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,930
寻死？
Dying?

510
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,790
他这么做，是有意搅乱我和华莉丝的事
Departing prematurely to complicate matters with Wallis.

511
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,140
看在老天的份上，大卫
Oh for heaven's sake, David.

512
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,250
他一直有病，你怎么这么想
You know how long he's been ill.

513
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,800
华莉丝解释给我的，她这方面脑筋很好使
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever about these things.

514
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,000

1912年6月11日，在威斯敏斯特议会大厦
bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912

516
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,500
国王乔治五世确实任命过…
his Majesty King George V did constitute,

517
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,490
说需要有个监护人的角色
order and declare that there should be a guardian,

518
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,380
- 这是怎么回事？
- 以议会的形式
- what's going on here? - Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State.

519
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,920
我完全听不懂你在说什么
I cannot follow you. I'm confused and I don't understand

520
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,620
- 听不明白
- 是议会的决议，陛下
- … what you're taking about  - It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.

521
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,670
- 谁帮帮我？
- 我们能代您行使权利
- would you do that? - So we may act on your behalf.

522
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:43,310
表达的不清楚，我还是没懂什么意思
not clearly I'm afraid...I'm still confused...

523
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,490
- 您同意就好
- 谢谢
But Approved. Thank you.

524
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,070
- 我来帮您，陛下
- 好的
- Let me help you sir - alright

525
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,470
- 谢谢陛下
- 谢谢
- thank you sir - thank you

526
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,730
觉得好点了吗，陛下？
Feeling a little better Sir?

527
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,780
没有任何好转，我感觉很糟
No. I'm not feeling any better. I feel dreadful.

528
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,270
你去滑冰玩了？
Been ice-skating?

529
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,380
没有，乔治
No, George.

530
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,850
他肯定没事儿
Yes, he's alright. Of course.

531
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,450
我知道，亲爱的，这样长谈…
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk,

532
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,960
也绝比不上和你相拥而眠
is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.

533
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,190
近期见面肯定不容易
Nor making our own drowsies either,

534
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,780
尤其是和你一起
as we've had to do far too often lately.

535
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,740
- 大卫，吃晚饭了
- 我在和华莉丝通话
- David, the dinner - I'm on with Wallis

536
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,870
是伯蒂
It's Bertie.

537
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,870
不是要紧事儿。…我也不想啊
No, it's not important. No. I don't want to

538
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,050
回头给我电话？好了，再见
No, telephone me later? Right, bye

539
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,360
华莉丝非常想念我
Wallis misses me terribly.

540
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,310
妈妈说你吃晚饭迟到了
Mama says you're late for dinner.

541
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,580
她忘了老爸的表总是拨快半个小时！
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!

542
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,220
国王身体如何？希望他疼痛缓解
How is the king? I hope he is not in pain.

543
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,960
没事儿了，陛下现在安静很多了
No, no, His Majesty is quieter now.

544
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,740
谢谢
Thank you

545
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,760
大卫，要是你父亲在
这样不守时是绝不允许的
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.

546
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,360
不可能容忍任何这些无礼举止
None of this..unpleasantness would be tolerated

547
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,880
殿下，我很欣赏您和国王有所不同的…
You know Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father

548
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,950
…性格和眼光
Both in outlook and temperament.

549
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,740
我希望您明白，每当国王质询您的举止时
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,

550
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,080
我总是说好话，把您的最佳一面展现出来
I tried in your interest to present it in a most favorable light.

551
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:31,020
我相信您会把我的利益放在心上
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.

552
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,240
恐怕我们的守夜时间不会长了…
I'm fear our vigil will not be of long duration.

553
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,580
请继续用餐，谢谢…
Please continue, thank you

554
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,640
请把我们的兄弟乔治托付给仁慈的上帝
just commend our brother George to the mercy of God,

555
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,810
我们的造物主，赎罪者
our Maker and Redeemer.

556
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,230
国王万岁
Long live the King.

557
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,230
但愿我能成为父亲那样好国王
I hope I will make good as he has made good.

558
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,750
你刚才究竟是怎么了？
What on earth was that?

559
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,840
可怜的华莉丝。我是解脱不了了
Poor Wallis. Now I'm trapped!

560
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,320
在过去的25年的风风雨雨中
And in these last 25 crowded troubled glorious years

561
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,430
国王乔治教给了我们最重要的…
If there's one thing that King George has taught

562
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,400
是他的领袖风范，以及对臣民兄长般的温暖
t is the art of the leader with also a brother to his followers

563
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,550
他活着的时候，是整个帝国的指路明灯
As long as he lives he was the guiding star of a great nation

564
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,970
爸爸？
（广播：当国王过世，街上的小朋友们失声痛哭）
Dad? (When he died, the little children cried in the street)

565
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,760
换换脑筋？
（广播：当国王过世，街上的小朋友们失声痛哭）
Time for a Shake, dad?

566
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,900
- 你愿意？
- 来吧
- You sure? - Go on

567
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,640
你们得绞尽脑汁了
Put your thinking caps on.

568
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,510
我猜他要演苏格兰戏剧
Bet its the Scottish Play.

569
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,520
我猜是《奥赛罗》，每次都是
No, I bet it's Othello. It's always Othello.

570
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,410
“您害怕吗？不要怕”
（莎士比亚戏剧《暴风雨》）
“Art thou afeard? Be not afeard”

571
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,040
- 你演的是 凯列班
- 老天爷，你这是碰巧猜中
- Caliban! - Oh! For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!

572
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,670
别理书呆子了，爸爸你继续
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

573
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,680
“这岛上充满了各种声音”
（凯列班是该剧的头号反派）
“the isle is full of noises,

574
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,820
“悦耳的乐曲，使人听了愉快，不会伤人”
（《暴风雨》第三幕第三场）
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.

575
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,160
“有时成千的叮咚乐器…”
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments

576
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,670
“在我耳边鸣响；有时醒来听到歌声”
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,

577
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,470
“又让我沉沉睡去”
That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:”

578
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,470
那好，搅局的小子，下面什么台词？
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?

579
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,310
- “然后在梦中，我在云端…”
- 是“在云端，我”
- “..and then, in dreaming, Me thought the clouds” - the clouds me thought

580
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,990
“在云端…我见云层打开”
“The clouds me thought would open,

581
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,630
“无数珍宝向我倾倒下来”
And show riches Ready to drop upon me; that...”

582
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,830
“醒来后，哭着想要再做一遍同样的梦”
...when I waked, I cried to dream again.”

583
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,310
这么想真可怜
It's such a sad thought.

584
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,230
我下个病人来早了，抱歉你们得先走了
My next patient must be a bit early. You better go lads, I'm sorry.

585
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,150
克利福德，你稍等一下
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

586
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,930
伯蒂，他们通知我你不过来了
Bertie, they told me not to expect you.

587
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,310
对你父亲的过世，我很遗憾
Sorry about your father.

588
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,660
我不想冒昧打扰的…
I don't wish to intrude..

589
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,710
不不，没关系，请进
No..Not at all, please come in

590
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,440
我一直在练习，每天一小时
I've been practising. One hour a day.

591
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,450
雷打不动
In spite of everything.

592
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,190
这是怎么回事？
What's going on there?

593
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,670
抱歉，我和孩子们闹着玩着
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.

594
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,250
今天还想练习一下？
Do you feel like working today?

595
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,490
柯蒂斯双翼飞机
A Curtis bi-plane.

596
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,670
我准备点热牛奶
I'll put on some hot milk.

597
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,420
罗格，给我来点烈酒
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.

598
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,340
我没见到我父亲的最后一面
I wasn't there for my father's death.

599
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,370
我心里一直很过意不去
Still makes me sad.

600
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,520
我能理解
I can imagine so.

601
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,150
- 你父亲是做什么的？
- 酿酒师
- What did you father do?  - He was brewer.

602
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,440
- 噢
- 至少我有免费啤酒
- Oh. - At least there was free beer.

603
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,950
为纪念你父亲，干一杯
Here's to the memory of your father.

604
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,300
在他…过世后，有人告诉我
I was informed, after the fact,

605
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,570
我父亲的…遗言是：
my father's …last words were:

606
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,260
“伯蒂比…他所有兄弟加起来…还要勇敢”
“Bertie has more.. guts than the rest of his brothers.. put together.”

607
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,320
可惜他没能当面告诉我
He couldn't say that to my face.

608
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,220
我哥哥
My brother.

609
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,670
他怎么了
What about him?

610
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,700
- 你可以唱着说
- 什么？
- Try singing it. - I'm sorry?

611
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,770
你会唱什么曲子？
What songs do you know?

612
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,590
- 歌谣？
- 《斯旺尼河》
- Songs? - “Swanee River”

613
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,060
- 我喜欢这曲子
- 正好是我的最爱
- I love that song. - Happens to be my favorite.

614
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,680
- 把和声哼给我听
- 不，肯定不唱
- Sing me the chorus. - No. Certainly not.

615
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,270
我一直…想要做模型
I always.. wanted to build models.

616
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:55,380
父亲…不会允许的。他…集邮
Father… wouldn't allow it. He.. collected stamps.

617
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,060
我们也得集邮
We had to collect stamps.

618
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,410
要是唱歌的话，你就可以把它做完
You can finish that off. If you sing.

619
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:08,950
- “我哥哥大卫，啦啦啦”
- 我不会坐在这儿傻唱的
- “My brother David, doo-dah” - I'm not going to sit here wobbling

620
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,170
和我别见外
You can with me.

621
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,430
是啊…因为你很怪
Because… you're peculiar.

622
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,290
我就把这当成赞美喽
I take that as a compliment.

623
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,190
你得守规矩
Rules are rules

624
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:29,060
我才不会…哼唱《斯旺尼河》！
I'm not…crooning “Swanee River!”

625
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,590
那换成《康城赛马歌》
Try “Camptown Races” then.

626
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,060
“我哥大卫，他对我说，啦啦啦啦”
“My brother D, he said to me, doodah doo-dah...”

627
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,840
- 连续发声让你保持连贯
- 不行
- Continuous sound will give you flow. - No

628
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,110
现在大卫成了国王，你不觉得不舒服吗？
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?

629
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,810
实话实说，我是松了一口气
Tell you the truth, It was a relief...

630
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,070
得知…国王不是…是我
Knowing.. I wouldn't be ..King.

631
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,260
不过如果他没有后代，那你就是接班人
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.

632
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,610
然后你女儿伊丽莎白会接替你
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.

633
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,470
“这个话题可不对头，医生，医生”
“You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.”

634
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,040
叫我“莱诺”，你没结巴啊
“Lionel,” You didn't stammer.

635
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,180
当然不会，我在唱歌！
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!

636
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,290
好吧，作为小小的奖励
Well, as a little reward,

637
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,130
你可以在这些支架上涂些胶水
you get to put some glue on these struts.

638
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,080
- 你儿子不介意吧？
- 不会，放心吧
- your boy wouldn't mind? - No, not at all

639
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,340
我和大卫很亲近
David and I were very close.

640
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,300
像两头年轻的雄鹿…你懂的
Young bucks... You know.

641
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,720
追求过同一个女孩？
Did you chase the same girls?

642
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:01,100
大卫牵线搭桥很在行
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.

643
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:10,550
我们享受过…巴黎“波莱特”馆的顶级服务
We shared… the expert ministrations of “Paulette” in Paris.

644
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,810
当然不是同时来了
Not at the same time of course.

645
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,720
大卫取笑过你吗？
Did David ever tease you?

646
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,520
当然，别人总是这样
Oh yes they all did.

647
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,330
“伯伯伯…伯蒂”
“Buh-buh-buh-Bertie”.

648
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,260
父亲也推波助澜
Father encouraged it.

649
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,050
“快点说啊，小子”
“Get it out, boy!”

650
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,850
以为这样就能让我不结巴
Said it would make me stop.

651
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,160
他说，“我就很怕我爸”
Said...”I was afraid of my father,

652
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,810
“我孩子怕我是理所当然”
and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me”.

653
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,480
你是天生习惯右手吗？
Are you naturally right handed?

654
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:57,080
我以前是左撇子…老罚我，就改成右手了
Left. I was… punished. Now I use the right.

655
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,320
这在结巴患者中挺常见的
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

656
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,890
还有什么矫正之类的？
Anything other corrections?

657
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,030
膝盖外翻
Knock knees.

658
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:15,400
金属…夹板套着…昼夜都得带
Metal… splints were made...worn…day and night

659
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,750
那肯定不好受
That must have been painful.

660
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,170
非常难受。总算现在是直腿了
Bloody agony. Straight legs now.

661
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,000
家里人谁和你最亲近
Who were you closest to in your family?

662
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,310
奶妈。不过不是最早的那个
Nannies. Not my first nanny..

663
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,810
她喜欢大卫，讨厌我
she loved David...hated me.

664
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:41,070
每天我该见父母的时候…
When I.. was presented to my parents for the daily viewing,

665
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,150
她…她都掐我，我就哭
she'd...She pinch me so I'd cry,

666
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,040
然后我…就马上带回来让她照顾
and be…handed back to her immediately,

667
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,390
然后她就不…
then she wouldn't…

668
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:08,850
- 唱出来吧
- 她就不让我吃饭，离我远远的
- sing it - then she wouldn't feed me, far far away.”

669
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,180
我父母三年以后才发现
Took my parents three years to notice.

670
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,550
你也能想象的到
As you can imagine,

671
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,620
给我胃留下了病根，现在还没好
it caused some stomach problems. Still.

672
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,440
你兄弟乔尼呢？
What about your brother Johnnie?

673
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,080
和他亲近吗？
Were you close to him?

674
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,330
乔尼，人很不错
Johnnie, Sweet boy.

675
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:55,570
有癫痫…他…有点“怪”
Epilepsy...and...he was 'different'.

676
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:04,140
13岁死后，家里人就不再提他
He died at 13, hidden from view.

677
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,910
大人说这不是光彩事儿
I've been told it's not catching.

678
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,250
- 再加点酒
- 多谢
- Do you want a top-up? - Please.

679
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,560
其实，莱诺…
You know, Lionel,

680
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,460
- 你是第一个英国平民…
- 澳大利亚人
- you're the first ordinary Englishman... - Australian.

681
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,820
…我能亲口交谈的人
...I've ever really spoken to.

682
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,870
以前我坐车路过大街
when I'm driven through the streets and see,

683
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,840
看到百姓们盯着我看
you know, the Common Man staring at me,

684
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,940
我忽然想到…
I'm struck by how little I know of his life,

685
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,380
我们其实都彼此了解甚少
and how little he knows of mine.

686
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,900
- 谢谢
- 朋友就是弥补这一点的
- Thank you - What're friends for.

687
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,280
以前我不懂
I wouldn't know.

688
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,080
巴尔默罗城堡，苏格兰
Balmoral Castle, Scotland

689
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,030
“我筛出来七根硬杆蓟草”
（顺口溜）
“I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles

690
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,230
用我又厚又硬的筛子
through strong thick sieves.

691
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,020
我筛出来七…
I sifted seven...”

692
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,900
- 亲爱的，你不歇歇吗？
- 我必须坚持练习才行
- isn't that enough darling? No? - I have to keep doing this

693
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,130
这都怪你
This is your fault.

694
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,240
- 我筛出来七根
- 哦不
- I sifted seven - Oh no

695
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,600
一百年的云杉就这么砍了，怕挡她视线
One hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!

696
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,490
她以为她算老几
Who do you think she is?

697
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,830
不过…我们必须对辛普森太太表现的友好些
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.

698
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,140
你知道她叫我“苏格兰的胖厨师”吗
You know she calls me “The Fat Scottish Cook”?

699
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,930
你才不胖
You're not fat.

700
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,120
我是有点丰满了
I'm getting plump.

701
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,880
你也不做饭啊
You seldom cook.

702
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,850
- 我筛出来七
- 闭嘴啦
- I sifted seven. - Shut up!!

703
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,650
我筛出来…
I sifted…

704
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,850
- 3，2，1，酒会开始
- 约克公爵和公爵夫人殿下到来
- 3,2,1 and booze - Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.

705
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,470
真高兴见到你们俩
How lovely to see you both.

706
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,890
欢迎来到我们的乡村小屋
Welcome to our little country shack.

707
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,800
我是应国王的邀请而来
I came at the invitation of the King.

708
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,440
陛下
Your Majesty

709
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,650
- 好的
- 抱歉我们迟到了
- All right - Sorry we're late

710
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,980
见到您很高兴，辛普森太太
Very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson

711
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,990
很高兴
Very nice

712
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,810
你好，大卫
Hello David.

713
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,860
我看你…改造了…花园
Making… some changes to the garden I see.

714
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,780
是啊，还没完工
I am. I am not quite finished yet.

715
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,740
我这算举止无礼吗，丘吉尔先生？
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.

716
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,510
正好相反，殿下
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.

717
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,510
礼节规定要由宴会主人接待王室成员
Etiquette decrees royalty should be greeted by the official host:

718
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,970
应该是国王本人迎接你，而不是平民百姓
in this case: the King. Not a commoner.

719
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:09,090
- 谢谢
- 她怎么迷住他的？
- Thank you. - what is her hold on him?

720
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,320
想不明白啊
I've no idea.

721
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,660
不过显然她有些…技巧
Apparently she has certain...skills,

722
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,670
在上海的圈子练就了一身功夫
which she learnt in an establishment in Shanghai.

723
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,090
- 大卫
- 马上就弄好，宝贝
- David - just be a sec, darling

724
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,720
失陪
Excuse me.

725
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,340
大卫，我一直想要见你
David, I've been trying to see you...

726
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,520
我日理万机啊
I've been terribly busy.

727
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,170
- 忙什么
- 做国王
- Doing what? - Kinging.

728
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,140
是么
Really?

729
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,170
现在国王…可没那么好当
Kinging.. is a precarious business these days!

730
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,670
俄国沙皇没请？
Where is the Tsar of Russia?

731
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,320
威廉表亲也没来？
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?

732
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,640
别没事找事
You're being dreary.

733
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,080
国王的本职就是先辞掉80个家仆
再送华莉丝更多珍珠？
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis

734
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,370
现在欧洲可是有群众游行，唱着“红旗飘扬”
while there are people marching across Europe singing “The Red Flag”?

735
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,380
别担心了，希特勒肯定会摆平他们
Stop your worrying. Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.

736
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,800
那谁来摆平希特勒？
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?

737
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,450
那瓶23年的酒呢？
Where's the bloody 23'?

738
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,690
你居然让她住母亲的房间？
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?

739
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,730
妈妈现在又没睡觉
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?

740
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,900
这一点都不好笑
That's not funny.

741
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,140
找到了，华莉丝喜欢好酒
Here it is, Wally likes the very best.

742
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,700
我不管你今晚和谁潇洒
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night,

743
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,270
只要你早上能履行职责！
as long as you show up for duty in the morning!

744
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,360
华莉丝不是我只想潇洒一下的对象
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.

745
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,170
我们想要结婚
We intend to marry

746
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,220
什么？
Excuse me?

747
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,680
她正在办离婚
She's filing a petition for divorce.

748
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,810
我的天哪
Good God.

749
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,780
你送她套房子和名头不就行了？
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?

750
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,390
我不想让她当我的情妇
I'm not having her as my mistress.

751
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,740
教会是不会承认离婚的
The Church does not recognise divorce

752
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,100
你还…代表着教会
and you are the… head of the Church.

753
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,450
- 我没有特权吗？
- 很多优待条件
- Haven't I any rights? - Many privileges...

754
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,940
这不一样。你的百姓可以为了爱情结婚
Not the same thing. Your beloved Common Man may marry for love,

755
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,990
我就不行？
Why not me?

756
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,470
如果想当百姓
If you were the Common Man,

757
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,450
你做国王的依据又在哪里？
on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!

758
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,600
听起来你对可悲的宪法研究很透啊
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.

759
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,000
听起来你就没读过
Sounds like you haven't.

760
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,200
原来你是这意思？推我下台？
Is that what this is all about? Bashing up?

761
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,960
背地里搞什么辩论训练
Hence the elocution lessons?

762
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,480
传的满城风雨了
That's the scoop around town.

763
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,430
我只是…是想…
I'm trying to…to...

764
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,320
想要更多人听你的话吗
Yearning for a larger audience are we,

765
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,770
伯伯伯…伯蒂？
B-b-b-bertie?

766
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,160
别…别…
D-don't…

767
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,290
什么？没听懂啊
What's that? I'm sorry.

768
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,310
弟弟想要推翻哥哥的王位
Young brother trying to push older brother off throne...

769
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,380
相当有中…中世纪风格啊
Po..Po..sitively medieval.

770
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,700
- 华莉丝
- 你刚才去哪儿了？
- Wallis - where have you been all this time?

771
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,060
有人找我聊天
I've been talking to.

772
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,430
算了
Never mind.

773
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,780
- 你这国王还真是神秘莫测
- 努力保持风格
- It's very complicated little king you're  - I tried to be

774
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,700
努力了半天都白费了
All that work, down the drain.

775
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:05,670
我对…哥哥…当面说不出…一个字来！
My own ..brother... I couldn't say.. a single word to him in reply!

776
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,190
为什么你对大卫结巴，对我说就没事？
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?

777
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,950
那是因为我给你钱了！
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!

778
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,060
伯蒂，我可不是卖艺的歌女
Bertie I'm not a geisha girl.

779
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,200
你就不能装傻一下吗！
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!

780
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,770
究竟大卫哪一点让你说不出话来？
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

781
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:23,180
你怎么老是对这烂事儿纠缠不休？
What is it about you that bloody well make you want to go on about it the whole bloody time?

782
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,930
说粗话很流利，这时候你不结巴
Vulgar but fluent. You don't stammer when you swear.

783
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,200
滚开！
Bugger off!

784
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,580
骂人只能到这种程度？
Is that the best you can do?

785
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:35,190
你这讨厌的家伙，野蛮的混蛋
Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

786
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,070
小学生都比你骂得狠
A public school prig can do better than that.

787
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:46,100
妈的，妈的，妈的，妈的！
Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

788
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,020
嘴里吐脏字很轻松吧？
Defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?

789
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,280
因为我很生气！
Because I'm angry!

790
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,770
噢，你知道F开头的词？
Ah. Know the f-word?

791
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,110
F..Fornication(通奸)？
Fornication?

792
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,580
别装了
Oh Bertie.

793
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,120
(Fuck)操，操，操，操！
Fuck. Fuck, fucking, fuck!

794
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,380
混蛋，混蛋，混蛋！
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

795
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,130
操操操，贱货
Fuck Fuck ass

796
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,780
- 操蛋，操蛋
- 看到了吧，一点不结巴
- Balls Balls Fuckity - Yes! You see! Not a hesitation!

797
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,390
小鸡鸡，妈的，操，大波波
Willy, Shit and Fuck, and tits

798
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,430
爸爸？你们在干啥？
Dad? What's going on?

799
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,130
抱歉了，你继续安心写作业
Sorry. Just finish your homework.

800
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,970
你的这种形象，人们可不常见到啊
Well that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.

801
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,720
有规矩的…至少公开场合不行
No. No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.

802
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,610
出去透透气吧
Let's get some air.

803
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,380
罗格，我觉得这么出去不太好
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.

804
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,750
怎么了？在担心什么事吗？
What's the matter? Why are you so upset?

805
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,690
罗格，你想都想不到
Logue, you have no idea.

806
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:49,720
我哥哥…迷上了一个结了两次婚的女人
My brother.. is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice

807
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,450
她正在办理离婚
She's asking for a divorce

808
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,990
我哥铁了心要娶她
And he is determined to marry her.

809
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,940
来自巴尔的摩的华莉丝·辛普森夫人
（美国城市名）
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.

810
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,620
听着就不对劲。来自美国的英国王后？
That's not right. Queen Wallis of Baltimore?

811
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,700
成何体统
Unthinkable.

812
01:03:05,017 --> 01:03:06,799
- 他能这么做吗？
- 绝对不行
- Can he do it? - Absolutely not.

813
01:03:08,273 --> 01:03:10,886
不过，他是收不住了，马上事情就会一团糟
But he's going to anyway. All hell's broken loose.

814
01:03:12,686 --> 01:03:14,305
他们就不能私下继续吗？
Can't they carry on privately?

815
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:15,263
要是他们愿意就好了
If only they would.

816
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:18,765
这不是留给你位子了？
Where does that leave you?

817
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:22,553
我知道我的位置！
I know my place!

818
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:30,464
我…会尽一切所能，帮我哥哥保住王位
I'll… do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.

819
01:03:32,353 --> 01:03:37,165
这不是很现实的情况吗？你很可能当上国王
Is it that serious? Your place may be on the throne.

820
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:38,758
我无意顶替我哥哥
I am not an alternative to my brother.

821
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:40,575
- 你会比他更称职
- 说话别太过分
- You can outshine David... - Don't take liberties!

822
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:44,590
你这算谋反
That's bordering on treason.

823
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,515
我只是说你能做个好国王，没问题的
I'm just saying you could be King. You could do it!

824
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:47,857
这是谋反！
That is treason!

825
01:03:48,144 --> 01:03:50,017
我只想让你明白，你没必要被恐惧束缚手脚
I'm trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.

826
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:51,057
我受够了！
I've had enough of this!

827
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:53,857
你在怕什么？
What're you afraid of?

828
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:55,244
你恶毒的蛊惑！
Your poisonous words!

829
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:56,222
那你还来找我？
Why'd you come to me?

830
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,797
你可不是什么中产阶级的银行家，练练嘴皮子
You're not middle-class banker who want elocution lessons…

831
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:02,121
- 好在宴会上显摆一下
- 别插手我的公事！
- so you can chit-chat at posh tea parties? - Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!

832
01:04:03,918 --> 01:04:07,133
我的父亲是…国王
I'm the son of a… King...

833
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:09,181
我的哥哥是…国王
the brother of a King...

834
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:13,186
而你是个让人失望的酿酒师的儿子
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!

835
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:16,564
乡下过来的新手，乱给我指挥
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!

836
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:20,543
你是无名小卒。治疗结束！
You're nobody. These sessions are over!

837
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:00,238
您这边请
Through here sir.

838
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:04,259
花园入口，首相办公室，唐宁街10号
Garden Entrance.Prime Minister's Office.10 Dawning Street

839
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,775
不单单因为她是美国人
It's not just because she's an American.

840
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:13,218
虽然这点就足够了，还因为她就要离婚两次了
That the least of it, it's because she is soon to be a twice divorced American,

841
01:05:14,746 --> 01:05:17,336
国王是英格兰教会的领袖
and the King, as the head of Church of England…

842
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:20,398
不能娶一个离过婚的女人
can not marry a divorced woman.

843
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:26,268
殿下，这么说可能有点过火…
And sir, I apologize for the nature of this, but...

844
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:28,618
不过根据苏格兰场的调查
according to Scotland Yard,

845
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:39,447
辛普森太太爱的不止国王一个
the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs.Simpson's favours and affections,

846
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:44,469
现在还有个已婚的卖汽车的
sharing them with a married used car salesman,

847
01:05:44,797 --> 01:05:46,435
她是脚踩两条船
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.

848
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:53,234
另外，传言希特勒的大使…
In addition, it is also rumored that Hitler's ambassador,

849
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:57,350
里宾特洛甫，每天给她送17支康乃馨
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day......

850
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:03,112
如果国王陛下继续无视内阁的忠告
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government,

851
01:06:03,854 --> 01:06:08,931
要么他自己退位，要么政府集体辞职
He must abdicate. Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.

852
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:15,185
首相，在这个时候把国家变成一团散沙？
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a… government?

853
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:18,921
究竟国王是自己随心所欲…
Does the King do what he wants,

854
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,114
还是承担民众赋予的职责？
or does he do what his people expect him to do?

855
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:26,380
唐宁街上的人们看着首相换了一届又一届
As crowds on Donning Street watch Ministers come and go

856
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:28,095
还是绕不开一个老难题
There raised an age-old problem.

857
01:06:28,377 --> 01:06:30,973
国王能否避免私生活影响自己的职责？
Can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?

858
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:34,614
- 怎么了，爱人？
- 有个病人很让我操心
- What's the matter, love? - I'm just having trouble with a patient

859
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:43,778
- 这可不像你，怎么回事
- 他很害怕
- it isn't like you. Why - He's scared.

860
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,568
不相信自己的力量
Frightened of his own shadow.

861
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:49,487
所以才找你治疗啊
Isn't that why they come to you?

862
01:06:52,953 --> 01:06:57,254
这人可以真正成就一番事业
可他把功夫都花到和我作对上了
This fellow could really be somebody great. He's fighting me.

863
01:06:58,324 --> 01:06:59,507
可能他只想过平常人的生活
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.

864
01:07:03,546 --> 01:07:04,728
是你把想法强加给他
Perhaps that's what you want.

865
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,401
我说的确实有点过分了…
I might have overstepped the mark.

866
01:07:13,653 --> 01:07:16,029
那就道歉，真诚的道歉
Apologize. Deep of good.

867
01:07:28,787 --> 01:07:30,820
很抱歉，罗格先生，公爵现在很忙
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue,the Duke is busy

868
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:35,054
我能等他，或者我回头再来
I'm happy to wait. Or I could come back later.

869
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,557
我告诉过您，公爵非常忙
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

870
01:07:48,642 --> 01:07:49,191
麻烦了
Thank you

871
01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:55,176
多谢
Thank you

872
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:04,837
议会不会支持这桩婚姻
Parliament will not support the marriage.

873
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:09,736
不过反对声音也有其他的考虑
But there were other reasons for concern.

874
01:08:11,446 --> 01:08:12,798
国王这么不懂法规
He was careless with state papers.

875
01:08:13,044 --> 01:08:14,160
这么没有决断和献身精神
He lacked commitment and resolve.

876
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:19,223
会有人担心，当和德国开战的时候
他能否顶住压力
There were those that worried where he would stand when war with Germany.

877
01:08:22,453 --> 01:08:23,248
会开战吗？
We're not coming to that?

878
01:08:24,123 --> 01:08:27,671
确实如此。虽然鲍德温首相可能不承认
Indeed we are, Sir. Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,

879
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,235
不过希特勒的野心昭然若揭
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

880
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:33,006
和德国开战势在必然
War with Germany will come,

881
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,699
我们需要一个强有力的国王代表我们的心声
and we will need a King we can all stand behind united.

882
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:46,419
我担心…我哥哥现在的精神状态不怎么样
I fear..my brother is of sound mind at this time

883
01:08:48,187 --> 01:08:49,931
就没想过由你来承担吗？
Have you thought what you will call yourself?

884
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:56,081
我…我…
I…I…

885
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,853
您当然不会，德国人才这么热衷权力
Certainly not Albert, Sir. Too Germanic.

886
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:12,076
那么想想你哥哥？在你父亲死后？
What about George? After your father?

887
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:15,455
新国王乔治六世
George the sixth.

888
01:09:16,704 --> 01:09:19,458
他可是完美继承了父亲的品性啊，不是么
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think.

889
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:28,091
大卫！总算找到你了，你看起来精神很不好
David! Thank God. You look exhausted!

890
01:09:32,286 --> 01:09:33,114
打起精神来啊
How are you bearing up?

891
01:09:34,531 --> 01:09:37,625
伯蒂，我已经决定了，我离开
Bertie. The decision's been made. I'm… I'm going

892
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:42,852
我不接受，你这么做太不负责任了
I cannot accept that. You are in no condition to make that decision.

893
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,039
我很抱歉，没有其他的方案了
I'm afraid there's no other way.

894
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:47,148
我一定要娶她
I must marry her.

895
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,539
我决心已定。我…很抱歉
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

896
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:57,731
这可不是好消息
That's a terrible thing to hear.

897
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:04,816
对谁来说都不是。尤其对我
nobody wants that. I least of all.

898
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:17,931
我总算能说出我自己的心声了
（我于1936年12月10日签字证明）
At long last I am able to say a few words of my own.

899
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:21,891
我其实一直不想隐瞒什么
（爱德华签署于观景台城堡）
I have never wanted to withhold anything

900
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:27,027
直到现在，按照法规，我才能说出想法
But until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.

901
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:34,731
几个小时以前，我主动解除了国王的职责
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.

902
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,008
现在由我的弟弟，约克公爵继位
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York

903
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,666
我在这里，首先表达对他的忠诚
my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.

904
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,434
全心全意地效忠于他
This I do with all my heart.

905
01:10:54,111 --> 01:10:57,352
你们也知道我不能参加新王加冕的原因
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.

906
01:10:58,948 --> 01:11:01,387
不过，请你们相信
But you must believe me when I tell you

907
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:06,425
如果没有我心爱的女人支持
That I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility

908
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,401
我无法承担国王的重任
and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do

909
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:16,465
也更不会有勇气卸任王位
without the help and support of the woman I love...

910
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:24,144
同样，因为我对我弟弟十分了解
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me

911
01:11:25,475 --> 01:11:27,180
使我卸任时，能够宽慰一些
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

912
01:11:28,415 --> 01:11:31,154
他对国家公事十分熟悉
with his long training in the public affairs of this country...

913
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:34,481
加上他的优秀品质
...and with his fine qualities...

914
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:39,295
不会让国家接下来出现动荡
...will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption

915
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:46,283
或者阻碍大英帝国的发展
or injury to the life and progress of the empire.

916
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:52,292
登基会议，1936年12月12日，圣詹姆斯宫
Accession Council.St James's Palace.12th Dec,1936

917
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:07,734
我今天与你们相见…在…
I meet you today.. in..

918
01:13:12,173 --> 01:13:14,063
…在这样的情况下…下…
in circumstances which are ..

919
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:33,088
你们肯定会喜欢的
I'm sure you'll love it.

920
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,031
谢谢，玛格丽特，装好马鞍
Thank you darling, saddles, Margret

921
01:13:36,426 --> 01:13:36,805
好的
Yes mom.

922
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:37,808
很听话嘛
Good boy.

923
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:41,950
- 妈妈，这是威尔逊马鞍
- 谢谢
- Mama, here's the Wilson saddle - thank you

924
01:13:43,645 --> 01:13:46,477
别担心，一会就喂你吃饭
Don't worry, we'll get you food in a minute

925
01:13:46,846 --> 01:13:49,200
妈妈，新家里会有地方放小马吗？
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?

926
01:13:49,477 --> 01:13:51,202
当然，宝贝们，整个宫殿有的是房间
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.

927
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:02,574
屈膝礼
Curtsey.

928
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:06,260
陛下
Your Majesty.

929
01:14:24,205 --> 01:14:24,585
讲话如何？
How was it?

930
01:14:37,343 --> 01:14:44,645
我试着…熟悉一下公务文件
I'm trying to… familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.

931
01:14:49,674 --> 01:14:53,704
鲍德温的急件我一个字都看不懂
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.

932
01:14:57,922 --> 01:14:58,596
这是哥哥的财务情况…
David's finances.

933
01:15:04,512 --> 01:15:07,537
这是圣诞讲话
The Christmas broadcast –

934
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:10,630
我觉得还会搞砸
I think that might be a mistake.

935
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:11,623
别担心了
Don't worry about that

936
01:15:23,655 --> 01:15:28,201
还有加冕礼。我觉得到时候会更出丑
Plans for the Coronation. I think that's an even bigger mistake.

937
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:32,539
我不是当国王的料
I'm not a King.

938
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:40,566
我只是个前海军军官，我就这水平
I'm a naval officer. That's all I know

939
01:15:44,135 --> 01:15:45,281
我不是当国王的料，我配不上
I'm not a King, not a king.

940
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:52,317
- 我很抱歉，我很抱歉
- 别这样，亲爱的
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No. Dear.

941
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:58,931
我亲爱的
Dear, dear man...

942
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:02,689
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

943
01:16:03,613 --> 01:16:08,907
其实我两次拒绝你的求婚
You know, I refused your first two marriage proposals,

944
01:16:09,255 --> 01:16:10,909
不是因为我不爱你
Not because I didn't love you,

945
01:16:15,272 --> 01:16:14,043
而是因为我受不了王室的生活
but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life

946
01:16:15,434 --> 01:16:18,748
四处出访，还有公众责任
Could bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties,

947
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:23,125
我不可能再安心过自己的小日子
a life that no longer was really to be my own.

948
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:28,274
不过后来我想，他结巴的这么可爱
Then I thought...he stammers so beautifully...

949
01:16:28,695 --> 01:16:29,734
大家会放过他的
they'll leave us alone.

950
01:16:34,734 --> 01:16:38,528
（支持国王。上帝保佑他）
STAND BY THE KING.GOD SAVE THE KING

951
01:16:56,714 --> 01:16:58,613
等待国王的道歉
Waiting for a king to apologize,

952
01:16:58,874 --> 01:17:01,024
可要耐心等上很久
one can wait rather a long wait.

953
01:17:06,037 --> 01:17:08,033
恐怕我们迟到了一会
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

954
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:14,193
这是我家了，我妻子去了伦敦桥
This is home. Myrtle's at bridge.

955
01:17:14,567 --> 01:17:15,688
我也让孩子们出去了
I've made sure the boys are out.

956
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:18,971
很温馨嘛，非常温馨
It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.

957
01:17:20,961 --> 01:17:22,400
- 我能坐下吗
- 当然
- May I sit down? - Yes, of course

958
01:17:30,803 --> 01:17:31,756
需要茶水吗，夫人？
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?

959
01:17:32,202 --> 01:17:33,153
我自己来吧
Yes. I'll help myself.

960
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:36,307
你们忙吧，难道还要我把你俩绑到一起不成？
Off you go now. Or must I knock your heads together?

961
01:17:39,047 --> 01:17:39,744
这是你赢的赌注
Here's your shilling

962
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:55,681
我…我明白你之前的意思了，罗格
I.. understand what you were trying to say, Logue.

963
01:17:57,397 --> 01:18:00,663
是我表达方式不对，很抱歉
I went about it the wrong way. I'm sorry.

964
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:04,780
我还是回来了
So here I am.

965
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:10,433
希望这个国家准备好听我两分钟的静音广播了
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?

966
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,745
每个病人都害怕努力半天又回到起点
Every stammer always fears they will fall back to square one.

967
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:16,370
我绝不会让这种情况出现
I don't let that happen.

968
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:21,399
如果我没能履行职责…大卫还能回来接任
If I fail in my duty... David could come back.

969
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:23,007
我看了布告了
I've seen the placards

970
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:27,856
“上帝保佑我们…国王”
“God Save Our… King!”

971
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:30,376
他们指的不是我
They don't mean me.

972
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:38,981
历史上君主的继任，都是在前人过世的情况下
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead,

973
01:18:40,123 --> 01:18:41,766
或者将不久于人世
Or about to be.

974
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:49,368
我的前任现在不仅活着，还活得好好的
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.

975
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:58,821
真是一团糟！我连圣诞讲话都做不了
Bloody mess! I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.

976
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,005
- 像你爸爸那样？
- 是啊
- Like your Dad used to do? - Precisely.

977
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:04,192
他已经不在了
He's not here anymore.

978
01:19:07,904 --> 01:19:09,982
他还在，就在我给你的硬币上面
Yes he is. He's on that shilling I gave you.

979
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:13,863
放手…其实很容易
Easy enough to give away.

980
01:19:14,953 --> 01:19:16,562
你不需要心里装着父亲的影子
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.

981
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:18,640
或者你哥哥
Or your brother.

982
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:24,047
五岁时能够吓到你的事情已经过去了
You don't need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five.

983
01:19:31,665 --> 01:19:33,040
你现在已经完全自己做主了，伯蒂
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

984
01:19:35,711 --> 01:19:36,080
明白
Right

985
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,591
以后硬币上就是你的肖像了，老兄
Your face is next, mate.

986
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:44,405
莱诺？亲爱的？
Lionel? Dear?

987
01:19:45,576 --> 01:19:45,965
我妻子！
Myrtle!

988
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:48,699
- 她回来了？ - 是的
- Is this your wife? - Yes.

989
01:19:50,727 --> 01:19:51,705
伯蒂，你过来
Bertie, come here

990
01:19:53,886 --> 01:19:55,709
- 罗格，你没事儿吧
- 没事儿
- Are you alright, Logue? - Yes.

991
01:19:59,149 --> 01:19:59,887
不该出去见面吗？
Shall we go through?

992
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:01,367
相信我，这么做才行
Trust me it's important.

993
01:20:03,455 --> 01:20:03,844
怎么回事？
What is it?

994
01:20:06,271 --> 01:20:07,459
你……您……
Your... your...

995
01:20:07,781 --> 01:20:08,861
第一次叫陛下就好
It's “Your Majesty”, the first time.

996
01:20:09,712 --> 01:20:13,205
然后可以称呼“女士”，发音别发错了
After that, “Ma'am”, as in ham, not Ma'lm as in palm.

997
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,977
我没和她说起过你们，先坐下歇歇
I haven't told her about us. Sit down, relax.

998
01:20:19,222 --> 01:20:23,036
我听说，你丈夫叫我丈夫“伯蒂”
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie

999
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:25,401
我丈夫叫你丈夫“莱诺”
and my husband calls your husband Lionel.

1000
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:27,849
希望你不会叫我“莉丝”
（王后名字的昵称）
I trust you won't call me Liz.

1001
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,207
陛下，您可以称呼我为罗格夫人
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.

1002
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:34,376
见到你很高兴，罗格夫人
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue

1003
01:20:37,197 --> 01:20:39,069
- 罗格，咱们不能整天猫在这里
- 必须这样
- Logue, we can't stay here all day. - Yes we can.

1004
01:20:39,386 --> 01:20:41,142
- 罗格…
- 我得等个恰当时机才行
- Logue.. - Look, I need to wait for the opportune moment.

1005
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:44,122
- 你这是怕老婆
- 说的很对！
- You're being a coward! - You're damn right.

1006
01:20:46,339 --> 01:20:47,190
快出去，一家之主
Get out there, man!

1007
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:53,400
你好啊，亲爱的老婆，你回来早了
Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! You're early.

1008
01:20:54,244 --> 01:20:55,919
我相信你们已经见过面了
I believe you two have met!

1009
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:00,792
不过还没见过…国王乔治六世吧？
I don't believe you know....King George VI?

1010
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:02,334
见到您很高兴
It's very nice to meet you.

1011
01:21:07,203 --> 01:21:09,385
陛下能一起吃晚饭吗？
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?

1012
01:21:11,463 --> 01:21:14,509
我们很想，这么盛情邀请，不过…
We would love to, such a treat, but alas...

1013
01:21:15,553 --> 01:21:17,360
我们之前有其他安排了，真是可惜
a previous engagement. What a pity.

1014
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:34,226
大主教
Archbishop.

1015
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,244
欢迎您，陛下
Welcome your Majesty.

1016
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:40,007
这里改造的十分壮观
What a glorious transformation, Sir.

1017
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,525
希望我们继续工作不会妨碍您
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.

1018
01:21:45,448 --> 01:21:50,405
请允许我讲一下仪式过程
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.

1019
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:59,518
我们从西入口开始，然后到中间广场
We begin, of course at the West Door, then into the nave.

1020
01:22:02,007 --> 01:22:04,766
大主教，听说你的所有宣言都会被广播
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1021
01:22:06,215 --> 01:22:10,824
是啊，无线电是把双刃剑
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.

1022
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:15,057
恐怕我也得批准新闻摄影机的拍摄
I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.

1023
01:22:15,652 --> 01:22:18,688
回头我会亲自剪辑的
The product of which I shall personally edit.

1024
01:22:19,553 --> 01:22:21,068
肯定毫不犹豫
Without momentary hesitation.

1025
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:25,174
这位是哈雷街的罗格医生
This is Dr. Logue from Harley Street.

1026
01:22:25,645 --> 01:22:28,635
他是我的语言矫正医生
He's… my speech therapist.

1027
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:30,657
大人
Your Grace

1028
01:22:31,205 --> 01:22:33,980
要是我知道陛下需要协助
Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance

1029
01:22:34,237 --> 01:22:35,669
我肯定会亲自推荐人选
I would've made my own recommendation.

1030
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:41,113
罗格医生需要参加加冕礼
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.

1031
01:22:42,536 --> 01:22:44,307
我当然可以和主持牧师说一下
Well of course I shall speak to the Dean,

1032
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,191
不过可能会很难办
but it will be extremely difficult.

1033
01:22:46,959 --> 01:22:54,077
我希望…医生坐在…国王的包厢中
I should like… the Doctor to be seated in the… King's Box.

1034
01:22:56,216 --> 01:22:58,367
可您的家人才能坐在那里，陛下
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.

1035
01:22:58,987 --> 01:22:59,980
所以他正合适
That why it's suitable.

1036
01:23:03,154 --> 01:23:05,071
现在，如果大人不介意的话
我们需要场地做一下排练
And now, if you don't mind, your grace we need the premises.

1037
01:23:05,357 --> 01:23:07,502
这位先生，这里可是威斯敏斯特教堂！
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!

1038
01:23:07,886 --> 01:23:09,596
教会一定要为陛下做好准备
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

1039
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,029
我的准备同样重要
My preparations are equally important.

1040
01:23:17,255 --> 01:23:19,176
需要无人打扰，希望您不要介意
With complete privacy. If you don't mind.

1041
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:23,574
这也是我的意思，大人
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1042
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:29,672
那今晚我把教堂给您处置
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal...this evening.

1043
01:23:31,388 --> 01:23:31,879
陛下
Your Majesty.

1044
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:55,849
看，他又来了。咱们走
Look, he again. Come on.

1045
01:24:03,902 --> 01:24:06,709
真不敢相信我走在乔叟、亨德尔、狄更斯的墓上
（这些诗人葬在教堂的诗人角落里）
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1046
01:24:10,789 --> 01:24:12,089
准备好了？开始吧
Everything alright? Let's get cracking.

1047
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,834
我来这儿不是彩排的，罗格“医生”
I'm not here to rehearse, "Doctor" Logue.

1048
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,144
叫我莱诺
Call me Lionel

1049
01:24:24,362 --> 01:24:27,351
是啊，你是一直…
True, you never…

1050
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:34,438
不叫自己医生，是我自己这么称呼的
called yourself 'Doctor'.I did that for you.

1051
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:46,911
没有训练，没有文凭，没有…执照
no training, no diploma, no.. qualifications.

1052
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:51,196
穷有一身的胆量
Just a great deal of nerve.

1053
01:24:52,757 --> 01:24:54,590
你这是来秘密审问我喽？
the star chamber inquisition, is it?

1054
01:24:55,246 --> 01:25:00,473
你还希望能信任你，公平对待你
You asked for trust and.. total equality.

1055
01:25:01,692 --> 01:25:03,028
伯蒂，我听了你在温布利的讲话
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley,

1056
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:04,396
我在场
I was there.

1057
01:25:06,197 --> 01:25:09,761
我儿子劳里说“你不能想法帮帮这个可怜人”？
My son Laurie said “Do you think you could help that poor man?”

1058
01:25:10,129 --> 01:25:10,928
就凭一个失业演员？
What, as a failed actor!?

1059
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:16,932
我确实不是医生，我也曾经参加表演
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,

1060
01:25:18,621 --> 01:25:21,708
我以前在酒吧朗诵，在学校教书
I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.

1061
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:27,187
战争来临时，大量前线士兵因为惊吓…
When the Great War came, our soldiers were pouring back from the front,

1062
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,000
…回到后方了，就不再开口说话
shell-shocked and unable to speak

1063
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:33,367
有人说，“莱诺，你不是对语言挺在行么”
and somebody said,"Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.

1064
01:25:33,664 --> 01:25:34,759
“你能想法帮帮他们吗”
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers”.

1065
01:25:37,268 --> 01:25:39,715
我尝试了肌肉治疗、练习、放松
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,

1066
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:41,205
不过我知道想根治还得更深入
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1067
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,701
这些小伙子们因为恐惧哭出声来
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear,

1068
01:25:46,111 --> 01:25:47,048
却没有人去用心听他们说话
and no-one was listening to them.

1069
01:25:50,028 --> 01:25:51,829
我的工作，是给他们说话的自信
My job was to give them faith in their voice

1070
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,798
让他们知道，总有位朋友愿意倾听
and let them know that a friend was listening.

1071
01:25:58,461 --> 01:26:00,160
这不是和你的治疗很像吗，伯蒂
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.

1072
01:26:06,007 --> 01:26:07,256
你这样太拔高自己了
You give a very noble account of yourself.

1073
01:26:08,265 --> 01:26:09,739
你去问问，都是事实
Make inquiries. It's all true.

1074
01:26:10,543 --> 01:26:11,649
我都问过了！
Inquiries have been made!

1075
01:26:11,962 --> 01:26:15,004
你是不知道有多少人巴不得帮我打听清楚
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.

1076
01:26:16,777 --> 01:26:22,672
我为你做了担保，你却连证书…都没有
I vouched for you and you have no…credentials.

1077
01:26:23,098 --> 01:26:26,175
可我治疗成功了很多人！我没有证书给你看
But lots of success! I can't show you a certificate

1078
01:26:27,122 --> 01:26:28,363
那时也没有系统的训练机构
there was no training then.

1079
01:26:28,628 --> 01:26:29,914
我只是按着经验行事
All I know I know by experience,

1080
01:26:30,262 --> 01:26:32,865
是这场战争，给了我经验
and that war was some experience.

1081
01:26:36,465 --> 01:26:38,242
我的牌子上写的是“L 罗格 语言矫正”
May plaque says, ‘L.Logue, Speech Defects'.

1082
01:26:38,687 --> 01:26:40,256
我没有自称医生
No Dr., no letters after my name.

1083
01:26:46,757 --> 01:26:47,474
关我进监狱好了
Lock me in the Tower.

1084
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:48,957
如果我有机会的话！
I would if I could!

1085
01:26:49,258 --> 01:26:49,944
什么罪名？
On what charge?

1086
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:52,029
诈骗！战争迫在眉睫
Fraud! With war looming,

1087
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:55,613
你让这国家的国王不能说话
you've saddle this nation with a voiceless King.

1088
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,731
毁了我家庭的幸福
You destroyed the happiness of my family...

1089
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:02,761
这都是精心诱捕一个知名病人的圈套
all for the sake of ensnaring a star patient

1090
01:27:03,099 --> 01:27:05,814
你不可能治好！
you couldn't possibly hope to assist!

1091
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:12,630
我会像疯国王乔治三世那样…
It'll be like mad …King George the Third,

1092
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:20,265
留下个结巴国王乔治的名号
there'll be…Mad King George the Stammerer,

1093
01:27:23,546 --> 01:27:26,292
在这样的关键时刻辜负人民的期望
who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!

1094
01:27:28,111 --> 01:27:30,570
你这成何体统？起来！
这不是你坐的！起来
What're you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! Get up

1095
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:31,802
有什么？不过是把椅子
Why not? It's a chair.

1096
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:37,137
这不是…这是…圣爱德华的椅子
No, it's not, that is… Saint Edward's Chair-

1097
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,863
人们还往上刻名字呢！
People have carved their name into it!

1098
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,776
这椅子上坐过所有的国王和王后
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen

1099
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,405
不过是块石头上的椅子
It's held in place by a large rock!

1100
01:27:43,696 --> 01:27:45,089
这是命运之石
That is the Stone of Scone,

1101
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:48,028
- 你怎么藐视一切
- 我不在乎
- you are trivialising everything - I don't care.

1102
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:51,126
我不在乎有多少王室成员的屁股坐过这里
I don't care how many Royal arses have sat in this chair-

1103
01:27:51,407 --> 01:27:52,078
你听我说！你听我说！
Listen to me... ! Listen to me... ! Listen to me... !

1104
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:52,934
- 听你的？为什么
- Listen to you?! By what right?

1105
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,207
我有权，你必须服从，我是国王！
My divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!

1106
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:55,965
你才不是，亲自跟我说…
Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself.

1107
01:27:56,262 --> 01:27:59,067
…你不想当。我干嘛要听你的？
Said you didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening to you?

1108
01:27:59,318 --> 01:28:00,390
因为我有发表意见的权利！
Because I have a right to be heard!

1109
01:28:00,665 --> 01:28:01,216
我的声音有份量！
I HAVE A VOICE!!!

1110
01:28:07,572 --> 01:28:08,386
是的，你有
Yes you do.

1111
01:28:18,984 --> 01:28:20,419
伯蒂，你有毅力
You have such perseverance, Bertie,

1112
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:21,477
你是我认识的最勇敢的人
you're the bravest man I know.

1113
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:24,171
你会成为一个相当好的国王
you'll make a bloody good king.

1114
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:34,497
这究竟是怎么回事，陛下？
What on earth's going on, Sir?

1115
01:28:34,914 --> 01:28:35,968
大主教，没事的
It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1116
01:28:37,016 --> 01:28:40,683
罗格先生，我已经找到了一个治疗师替换你
Mr Logue, you should know that I have found a replacement English specialist

1117
01:28:40,996 --> 01:28:45,255
简历无可挑剔。这里也不再需要你的服务了
with impeccable credentials. Hence, your services will no longer be required.

1118
01:28:45,956 --> 01:28:46,474
怎么回事？
I'm sorry?

1119
01:28:46,806 --> 01:28:49,340
国王可以询问或者被告知结果
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.

1120
01:28:49,745 --> 01:28:52,587
您没询问过我，那我告诉您结果
You didn't consult, but you've just been advised.

1121
01:28:55,101 --> 01:29:01,849
那我告诉你：这件事上，我必须自己做主
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.

1122
01:29:02,596 --> 01:29:06,579
我关心的是，王冠加冕在明君的头上
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.

1123
01:29:07,332 --> 01:29:08,567
我欣赏您的坦诚，大主教
I appreciate that Archbishop

1124
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:11,938
可这是我的头
but it's my head!

1125
01:29:14,536 --> 01:29:15,314
那卑职告退
Your humble servant.

1126
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:24,105
谢谢，伯蒂
Thank you Bertie.

1127
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:28,212
我们排练一下？
Shall we rehearse?

1128
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:30,117
来吧，坐在你位置上
Come on, up on your perch

1129
01:29:38,502 --> 01:29:41,027
当你和王后进入西门
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through West door,

1130
01:29:41,697 --> 01:29:45,004
人们会唱赞歌迎接你们：“对我说，我就欢喜”
you'll be greeted with the hymn “I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.”

1131
01:29:45,864 --> 01:29:47,427
不过你们欢喜不了
You won't actually be that glad,

1132
01:29:47,744 --> 01:29:48,659
他们会唱上很久很久
because they sing it for a great long time.

1133
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:54,886
然后你的朋友，主教大人会登上楼梯
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs towards you

1134
01:29:56,033 --> 01:30:00,499
对你说“陛下，您愿意宣誓吗？”
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"

1135
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:02,987
“我愿意”
“I am willing”.

1136
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:07,298
你当然愿意!我在后排听听效果如何
Course you are! I'll see what it sounds like from the cheap seats

1137
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:08,705
得让你的老奶妈也听得到
so even your old nanny can hear.

1138
01:30:10,108 --> 01:30:13,763
“您愿意统治大不列颠的领土…”
“Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland,

1139
01:30:14,086 --> 01:30:20,154
还包含爱尔兰，加拿大，澳大利亚，新西兰，
并尊重他们的土地和习俗吗？”
Canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?”

1140
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:23,072
“我庄严起誓，我愿意”
"I solemnly promise so do so."

1141
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:24,992
大声点！后面听不到
LOUDER! I can't hear you up the back.

1142
01:30:25,298 --> 01:30:27,177
“我庄严起誓，我愿意！”
“I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!”

1143
01:30:27,953 --> 01:30:32,673
非常好！“您愿意在所有决定中…”
Very good! "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice,

1144
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,550
“都考虑到法律、公平和仁慈吗？”
in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?"

1145
01:30:36,522 --> 01:30:37,469
“我愿意”，“我愿意！”
"I will." “I WILL!”

1146
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:41,769
然后会有人们共同努力之类的话…等等
Then a long bit about upholding the faith goes on, rubbish, rubbish

1147
01:30:42,433 --> 01:30:43,306
最后，你需要说…
To which you finally say...

1148
01:30:44,657 --> 01:30:48,757
“刚才我所承诺过的”
“These things which I have here before promised,

1149
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:53,612
“我会为之鞠躬尽瘁，请上帝保佑我”
I will perform and keep. So help me God.”

1150
01:30:54,672 --> 01:30:56,683
需要说的就这么多，简短四句话
That's all you have to say. Four short responses,

1151
01:30:57,589 --> 01:30:58,741
亲吻法典，签上誓言
kiss the book and sign the oath.

1152
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:00,661
大功告成：你就是国王了
There you are: you're King.

1153
01:31:02,059 --> 01:31:02,438
很简单
Easy.

1154
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:18,551
你差点把王冠戴反了，大主教
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!

1155
01:31:20,455 --> 01:31:23,982
有人把王冠正面的线拆掉了，陛下
Someone had removed the thread marking the front of the Crown, Sir.

1156
01:31:24,965 --> 01:31:26,456
可别这样了，大主教
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.

1157
01:31:28,104 --> 01:31:29,691
大主教，你戴偏了王冠
Archbishop, your missing Papa.

1158
01:31:35,102 --> 01:31:37,720
非常好，非常好，大主教
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1159
01:31:39,706 --> 01:31:42,317
我希望陛下对于结果很满意
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.

1160
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,793
你可以把机器关掉了
You can switch that machine off now.

1161
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:47,233
不，等等，继续放吧
No, wait, keeping going.

1162
01:31:48,998 --> 01:31:49,957
主教请坐
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

1163
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:02,347
（希特勒）
(Hitler)

1164
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,602
爸爸，他在说什么？
Papa, what's he saying?

1165
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:16,442
听不懂，不过听起来他说得很流利
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.

1166
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:45,248
陛下，我今天请求见您是要辞掉首相职务
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.

1167
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:49,857
鲍德温先生，我很遗憾
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.

1168
01:32:51,044 --> 01:32:53,764
张伯伦会接替我的首相职务
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.

1169
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:57,614
是原则问题，我之前的判断失误
It's a matter of principal. I was mistaken.

1170
01:32:59,943 --> 01:33:03,963
我仍然难以相信…
I have found it impossible to believe that

1171
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:10,168
世界上会有希特勒这样没有道德感的人
there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1172
01:33:12,113 --> 01:33:18,574
整个世界可能会卷进第二次战争的漩涡
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.

1173
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:25,912
丘吉尔是对的，希特勒一直有这个野心
Churchill was right all along. This was always Hitler's intention.

1174
01:33:27,499 --> 01:33:31,620
我只是觉得，在这样的危机关头辞职
I am only sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.

1175
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:36,265
我深感遗憾，我担心
I am very much afraid Sir,

1176
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:41,000
对您的最大考验，即将到来
That your greatest test is yet to come.

1177
01:33:46,551 --> 01:33:52,188
我是在唐宁街10号的内阁会议发来报道
（1939年9月3日）
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street.(3rd,Sep,1939)

1178
01:33:54,143 --> 01:34:02,847
今天早上，在柏林的英国大使
向德国政府发出最后通牒
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government

1179
01:34:03,343 --> 01:34:07,091
如果我们不在11点之前收到答复
a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock

1180
01:34:08,325 --> 01:34:12,369
如果德国不立即从波兰撤军的话
that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1181
01:34:13,532 --> 01:34:16,174
英国将对德国宣战
a state of war would exist between us.

1182
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:22,937
我们现在没有接到德国的通知
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received,

1183
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:29,541
这意味着英国对德国正式宣战
and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.

1184
01:34:36,132 --> 01:34:40,309
总算好了，这是您的演讲，6点钟直播
At last. Sir, here's your speech. You are on air at six.

1185
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:45,849
演讲大概需要9分钟
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.

1186
01:34:46,269 --> 01:34:47,943
稿子已经经过了审核
The wording is fully approved.

1187
01:34:48,686 --> 01:34:51,277
首相也会在广播节目中和您一起出席
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast

1188
01:34:51,599 --> 01:34:53,463
讲话会对整个大英帝国广播
which will go out live across to the Nation,

1189
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:55,661
我们的武装部队也能收到
the Empire and to our Armed Forces.

1190
01:34:56,101 --> 01:34:56,910
马上请罗格过来
Get Logue here immediately.

1191
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:13,627
吸引火力用的气球
there are the barrage balloons.

1192
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:17,691
是啊，很快就升起来了
Yes, they got them up there quickly.

1193
01:35:32,171 --> 01:35:33,456
我们要不停车躲一下？
Should we pull over and find shelter?

1194
01:35:33,911 --> 01:35:35,591
不，继续往前开，别担心
No, go straight there. We'll be alright.

1195
01:35:46,036 --> 01:35:49,323
- 您好
- 我是莱诺·罗格，哈丁少校找我
- Yes sir? - Lionel Logue, Major Harding is expecting me

1196
01:35:49,768 --> 01:35:50,357
这是我儿子劳里
This is my son Laurie

1197
01:35:58,882 --> 01:36:00,443
- 谢谢，劳里
- 祝你好运，爸爸
- Thank you Laurie  -Good luck dad

1198
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,764
- 国王的演讲，还有40分钟的时间
- 谢谢
- The King's speech, we have about 40 minutes to the broadcast - Thank you

1199
01:36:14,673 --> 01:36:15,884
非常感谢，谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you

1200
01:36:17,524 --> 01:36:22,162
“黑暗的日子即将来临…”
"There may be dark days ahead,and..."

1201
01:36:23,064 --> 01:36:23,909
再来
Try again.

1202
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:32,694
“黑暗的日子即将来临，战…”
“There may be dark days ahead, andw-... ”

1203
01:36:34,471 --> 01:36:36,570
把犹豫变成语气停顿，心里默念
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself,

1204
01:36:36,848 --> 01:36:37,445
“上帝保佑国王”
“God save the King”.

1205
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:40,681
我一直这么说，看起来没人听啊
I say that continually, but apparently no one's listening.

1206
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:44,077
长时间的停顿很不错，在这样的场合更显得庄重
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.

1207
01:36:45,106 --> 01:36:47,316
那我就是历史上最庄重的国王了
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.

1208
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:51,761
如果我是…国王，那我有什么权力？
If I am a..King...where is my power?

1209
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:53,871
我能组建政府吗？
Can I form a Government,

1210
01:36:54,285 --> 01:36:59,354
提高税收，或者发动战争？
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?

1211
01:36:59,794 --> 01:37:01,903
不行！可我还是要出面坐头把交椅
No! Yet I am the seat of all authority.

1212
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:07,167
为什么？因为整个国家相信…
Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak,

1213
01:37:07,459 --> 01:37:09,154
我的声音代表着他们。可我说不出来！
I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!

1214
01:37:11,581 --> 01:37:14,115
我们从头再来一遍，“在这样的严峻时刻”
Let's take it all again from the top. "In this grave hour..."

1215
01:37:26,736 --> 01:37:30,790
“在这样的严峻时刻，操操操”
“In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck

1216
01:37:31,164 --> 01:37:32,547
可能是历史上最紧要的…
perhaps the most fateful in our

1217
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:33,951
…关头，混蛋，妈的
history bugger shit shit

1218
01:37:34,205 --> 01:37:40,815
我为每个家庭的人…
I send to every household of my p-p-

1219
01:37:41,072 --> 01:37:42,121
我唱歌的时候都发不好P这个音
The ‘P' is always difficult even when I'm singing

1220
01:37:42,869 --> 01:37:44,210
那就利用a的发音跳过去
Bounce onto it 'a-peoples'

1221
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:53,327
不论是国内还是海外…
“a-peoples both at home and overseas,...”

1222
01:37:54,059 --> 01:37:54,818
很不错
Beautiful.

1223
01:37:55,729 --> 01:37:57,803
“这消息，啦啦啦啦”
“... this message, doo-dah, doodah....

1224
01:37:58,058 --> 01:37:59,954
我和你们一样怀着深情…啦啦
spoken with the same depth of feeling...doodah

1225
01:38:00,245 --> 01:38:03,833
带给我全部的子民们，操，妈的，混蛋
for each one of you as if I able to fuck shit bugger

1226
01:38:04,244 --> 01:38:07,576
跨过家家的门槛，带来我的…
cross your threshold and speak to you m-my - ...”

1227
01:38:10,167 --> 01:38:11,672
脑子现在想：“我有发言权”
In your head, now: “I have a right to be bloody well heard!”

1228
01:38:11,979 --> 01:38:12,802
发什么言，发什么言
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard,

1229
01:38:13,152 --> 01:38:14,888
除了我自己谁在听
bloody well heard myself!

1230
01:38:15,753 --> 01:38:18,640
现在是华尔兹舞，动起来，连续运动
Now Waltz. Move! Get continuous movement.

1231
01:38:19,246 --> 01:38:23,510
“这是我们大部分人第二次…”
“For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at wa - ...”

1232
01:38:25,092 --> 01:38:26,997
暂停…“我们…”再暂停
Pause. “we are...” Take a pause.

1233
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:27,861
这我做不成
I can't do this.

1234
01:38:28,251 --> 01:38:32,951
伯蒂，你能行的，看看最后一个自然段
Bertie, you can do it. Have a look at the last paragraph.

1235
01:38:33,386 --> 01:38:34,292
伯蒂，时间到了
Bertie...it's time.

1236
01:38:49,427 --> 01:38:50,932
- 大主教
- 陛下
- Archbishop - Your Majesty

1237
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,969
载入历史的时刻，陛下
A great moment, sir.

1238
01:38:58,755 --> 01:39:00,364
- 首相
- 陛下
- Prime Minister. - Your Majesty

1239
01:39:02,892 --> 01:39:07,106
很高兴能这么快再次见面
Nice to see you again, so soon.

1240
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:18,350
你能来…很好。相信你们今天都很忙
Good.. of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.

1241
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:22,472
希望我们不会受到空袭警报的影响
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.

1242
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:24,023
或者这些可怜的小狗
Or the wretched dogs.

1243
01:39:26,476 --> 01:39:31,170
- 恭喜，新任海军大臣
- 陛下
- Congratulations. First Lord of the Admiralty. - Your Majesty.

1244
01:39:35,614 --> 01:39:38,766
还得走上一段路
The long walk.

1245
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:46,973
祝您好运。我也担心过发音问题
Good luck, Sir. I too dread this...apparatus.

1246
01:39:48,872 --> 01:39:50,343
我也结巴
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.

1247
01:39:52,514 --> 01:39:57,259
- 这我可真不知道
- 家族秘密了，说话结巴
- I didn't. - Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1248
01:39:57,643 --> 01:39:58,452
做手术的话风险太大
An operation was considered too dangerous.

1249
01:39:58,882 --> 01:40:02,149
最后终于把这种嗓音变成我的个人特色
I eventually made an asset of it.

1250
01:40:05,637 --> 01:40:07,336
- 谢谢，丘吉尔先生
- 陛下
- Thank you, Mr Churchill. - Sir.

1251
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:09,070
亲爱的
Darling

1252
01:40:10,034 --> 01:40:10,761
还需要多久？
How long, Logue?

1253
01:40:11,267 --> 01:40:12,117
还要3分钟
Just under three minutes, Sir.

1254
01:40:32,618 --> 01:40:35,761
（5，4，3试音，2，1）
(5,4,3,check,2,1)

1255
01:40:43,948 --> 01:40:44,372
伍德先生
Mr Wood.

1256
01:40:44,874 --> 01:40:45,587
祝您好运，陛下
Good luck, Your Majesty.

1257
01:40:49,549 --> 01:40:49,944
伍德先生
Mr Wood.

1258
01:40:51,559 --> 01:40:54,234
- 你重新布置了这里，罗格
- 让环境舒服些
- You've redecorated, Logue. - I made it cozy.

1259
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,193
来点新鲜空气
Some fresh air.

1260
01:40:59,190 --> 01:40:59,815
好了，亲爱的
There you are, darling.

1261
01:41:04,736 --> 01:41:09,364
我筛选蓟草,我有个筛好蓟草的筛子
（绕口令）
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles

1262
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:11,606
我有个没筛好蓟草的筛子
and a sieve on unsifted thistles..

1263
01:41:11,975 --> 01:41:13,941
我筛选蓟草,我有个筛好蓟草的筛子
I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve of sifted thistles

1264
01:41:14,223 --> 01:41:16,260
伯蒂，宝贝，确定麦克风没开吧
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!

1265
01:41:17,597 --> 01:41:20,377
记住，红灯闪烁4下之后，我会让人灭掉灯
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off,

1266
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:23,827
免得有个鬼眼似的东西老盯着你
because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.

1267
01:41:25,937 --> 01:41:26,485
还有1分钟
One minute, sir.

1268
01:41:30,063 --> 01:41:31,579
肯定会有出色的表现
I am sure you will be splendid.

1269
01:41:43,923 --> 01:41:44,594
还有40秒
40 second, sir

1270
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:52,002
罗格，不管演讲结果怎样
Logue, however this turns out,

1271
01:41:54,716 --> 01:41:57,511
我都不知道该怎么回报你的帮助
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.

1272
01:42:00,932 --> 01:42:01,459
奖个爵位？
Knighthood?

1273
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,853
20秒
Twenty seconds.

1274
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:17,863
排除杂念，只想着说给我听
Forget everything else and just say it to me.

1275
01:42:19,825 --> 01:42:21,514
说给我这个朋友听
Say it to me, as a friend.

1276
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:20,224
在这样严峻的时刻，可能是国家存亡的紧要关头
In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,

1277
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:31,310
我向领土上的所有子民
I send to every household of my peoples,

1278
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:42,619
不论是国内或是海外
both at home and overseas

1279
01:43:53,489 --> 01:43:54,262
传达这份消息
this message

1280
01:43:56,750 --> 01:44:02,761
我和你们一样，百感交集
spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you

1281
01:44:04,317 --> 01:44:12,924
只希望我能挨家挨户亲自向你们诉说
as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.

1282
01:44:17,374 --> 01:44:26,491
我们大部分人，都是第二次经历战争的洗礼
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war.

1283
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:45,441
不止一次，我们尝试过寻求和平之道
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out

1284
01:44:46,434 --> 01:44:58,875
求同存异，化敌为友
of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.

1285
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:09,853
然而徒劳无功。我们被迫卷入了一场战争
But it has been in vain. We have been forced into a conflict.

1286
01:45:11,569 --> 01:45:17,711
我们所面临的，是一个邪恶信念的挑战
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which,

1287
01:45:18,254 --> 01:45:26,077
如果敌方取胜，世界的文明秩序将毁于一旦
if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.

1288
01:45:28,356 --> 01:45:35,217
这样的信念，剥去伪装的外衣
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,

1289
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:49,384
只是赤裸裸的权力追求
is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.

1290
01:45:51,457 --> 01:45:55,646
为了捍卫凝聚起我们的所有
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear,

1291
01:45:57,182 --> 01:46:06,597
我们无法想象去逃避这样的挑战
it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.

1292
01:46:10,247 --> 01:46:20,513
为了如此崇高目标，我呼吁国内的民众
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home

1293
01:46:21,522 --> 01:46:29,995
海外的子民们，万众一心
and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.

1294
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:42,068
我希望你们能冷静坚定，在时间的历练中团结向前
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.

1295
01:46:43,409 --> 01:46:49,911
任务将会困难重重，前路可能乌云密布
The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead,

1296
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:57,909
战场将不再局限于前线阵地。
and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.

1297
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:03,696
只有掌握真知才能正确行事
But we can only do the right as we see the right

1298
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:13,356
在此我们虔诚的向上帝承诺
and reverently commit our cause to God.

1299
01:47:15,665 --> 01:47:23,028
如果我们大家坚定信念
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it,

1300
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:34,066
上帝会保佑，我们必将获胜
then, with God's help, we shall prevail.

1301
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,343
说的非常棒，伯蒂
That was very good, Bertie.

1302
01:48:06,025 --> 01:48:07,766
不过发w这音还是会结巴
You still stammered on the “w”.

1303
01:48:09,732 --> 01:48:12,640
不能太流利了，免得怀疑是替身
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.

1304
01:48:18,385 --> 01:48:20,810
祝贺您，陛下，专业的播音员水准
Congratulations, your Majesty. A true broadcaster.

1305
01:48:21,504 --> 01:48:22,015
谢谢，伍德先生
Thank you, Mr Wood.

1306
01:48:26,387 --> 01:48:27,140
恭喜陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1307
01:48:29,228 --> 01:48:30,141
恭喜陛下
Congratulations, your Majesty.

1308
01:48:31,302 --> 01:48:31,625
谢谢
Thank you.

1309
01:48:43,037 --> 01:48:45,597
- 准备？
- 好
- Ready? - Good

1310
01:48:46,284 --> 01:48:46,682
非常好
Perfect

1311
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:52,934
你的第一次战时演讲，祝贺你
Your first war time speech. Congratulation.

1312
01:48:54,598 --> 01:48:58,187
以后的演讲少不了
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.

1313
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:03,158
谢谢，罗格
Thank you, Logue.

1314
01:49:13,608 --> 01:49:16,578
做得好，我的老兄
Well done. My friend.

1315
01:49:19,743 --> 01:49:22,307
谢谢您，陛下
Thank you... Your Majesty.

1316
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:36,776
我就知道你没问题
I knew you'd be good.

1317
01:49:47,114 --> 01:49:47,636
谢谢你…
Thank you...

1318
01:49:49,284 --> 01:49:50,302
莱诺
...Lionel. (first time call Lionel)

1319
01:49:53,437 --> 01:49:53,928
去阳台？
Onwards?

1320
01:49:56,099 --> 01:49:56,611
恭喜陛下
Congratulations, Sir

1321
01:49:59,032 --> 01:50:00,508
我自叹不如
Couldn't have said it better myself, Sir

1322
01:50:01,142 --> 01:50:03,626
陛下，您让我哑口无言
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.

1323
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:05,326
祝贺您，陛下
Congratulations, Sir

1324
01:50:06,073 --> 01:50:07,157
先生们
Gentlemen.

1325
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:10,896
爸爸表现如何，伊丽莎白？
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?

1326
01:50:13,788 --> 01:50:16,916
开头停了会，不过后面好的多
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.

1327
01:50:17,782 --> 01:50:18,228
上帝保佑你
Bless you.

1328
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:21,085
你觉得呢，玛格丽特？
And how about you, Margret?

1329
01:50:21,955 --> 01:50:23,624
你很了不起，爸爸
You were just splendid, Papa.

1330
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:24,771
是很惊人
Of course I was.

1331
01:50:27,269 --> 01:50:27,771
你们都准备好了？
You're all ready?

1332
01:50:29,522 --> 01:50:29,911
过来吧，孩子们
Come on girls.

1333
01:51:33,959 --> 01:51:36,703
乔治六世在1944年
King George VI made Lionel Logue

1334
01:51:37,169 --> 01:51:38,397
授予莱诺 维多利亚三等勋章
a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1944.

1335
01:51:39,657 --> 01:51:42,611
这份国王的感恩之情也开创了先例
This high honour from a grateful King made Lionel part of

1336
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:45,826
这是唯一一枚为王室服务的特别骑士勋章
the only order of chivalry that specifically rewards acts of personal service to the Monarch.

1337
01:51:47,209 --> 01:51:50,368
国王在战争中的每次演讲，都有莱诺陪在身边
Lionel was with the King for every wartime speech.

1338
01:51:50,844 --> 01:51:53,311
这些广播，使乔治六世成为了英国抵抗精神的代言人
Through his broadcasts, George VI became a symbol of national resistance.

1339
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,734
莱诺和伯蒂在余生中一直维持着亲密的友谊
Lionel and Bertie remained friends for the rest of their lives.

1340
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,720
