00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,910
公开讲话是我丈夫的职责之一
My husband is required to speak publicly.

101
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,650

是你让我开得太慢了，爸爸！
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

129
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,250

谢谢
Thank you.

234
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,670
你可以在这儿等你妈妈

242
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,780
我听说不能坐的太近
I was told not not to sit too close.

273
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,610
你最早的回忆是什么？

282
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,250
什么时候开始结巴的？
When did the defect start?

283
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,910
我从小就这样！
I've always been this way!

284
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,080
我很怀疑
I doubt that.

288
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,530
什么时候开始的？
When did it start?

290
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,990
这很典型

294
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,510
别开玩笑了
Don't be ridiculous.

295
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,510
自言自语的时候呢？
How about when you talk to yourself?

303
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,470
当你自言自语的时候，结巴吗？
when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?

304
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,320
当然不会！
Of course not!

305
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,950
这说明你的缺陷不是不可改变的
That proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.

321
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,990
这我读不了
I can't read this.

325
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960

412
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,900
那我怎么听到我说什么？

459
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,290
我下周来找你？
Shall I see you next week?

460
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,300
我要每天都见你
I shall see you every day.

465
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,960
深呼吸，扩张胸部
Take a nice deep breath, expand the chest

466
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,480
把手放到肋骨上
Put your hands on your ribs

467
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,030
深吸气，好
Deeper, good

493
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,540
加油，再试一次，伯蒂
come on, one more time, Bertie

494
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,740
你能行的
you can do it

502
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,160
你去哪儿了？
Where've you been?

507
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,850
我来开车
I'll drive.

529
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,380
没有，乔治
No, George.

539

540
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,310
妈妈说你吃晚饭迟到了

544
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,740
谢谢
Thank you

583
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,310
这么想真可怜
It's such a sad thought.

590
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,440
我一直在练习，每天一小时
I've been practising. One hour a day.

592
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,190
这是怎么回事？
What's going on there?

596
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,670
我准备点热牛奶
I'll put on some hot milk.

608
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,220
我哥哥
My brother.

639
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,340
我和大卫很亲近
David and I were very close.

645
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,720
大卫取笑过你吗？
Did David ever tease you?

653
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,480
你是天生习惯右手吗？
Are you naturally right handed?

659
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,750
那肯定不好受
That must have been painful.

661
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,000
家里人谁和你最亲近？
Who were you closest to in your family?

693
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,130
这都怪你
This is your fault.

705
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,470

708
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,440
陛下
Your Majesty

710

是么
Really?

736
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,800
那谁来摆平希特勒？
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?

740
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,900
这一点都不好笑
That's not funny.

745
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,170
我们想要结婚
We intend to marry

746
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,220
什么？
Excuse me?

748
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,810
我的天哪
Good God.

780
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,770
究竟大卫哪一点让你说不出话来？
What is it about David that stops you speaking?

783
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,200
滚开！
Bugger off!

789
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,280
因为我很生气！
Because I'm angry!

802
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,610
我们出去透透气吧
Let's get some air.

817
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:22,553
我知道我的位置！
I know my place!

824
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:47,857
这是谋反！
That is treason!

825
01:03:48,144 --> 01:03:50,017
我只想让你明白，你没必要被恐惧束缚手脚
I'm trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear.

826
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:51,057
我受够了！
I've had enough of this!

827
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:53,857
你在怕什么？
What're you afraid of?

829
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:56,222
那你还来找我？
Why'd you come to me?

839
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,775
不单单因为她是美国人
It's not just because she's an American.

857
01:06:28,377 --> 01:06:30,973
国王能否避免私生活影响自己的职责？
Can the King separate his personal life from his public duty?

867
01:07:28,787 --> 01:07:30,820
很抱歉，罗格先生，公爵现在很忙
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue,the Duke is busy

869
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,557
我告诉过您，公爵非常忙

别担心了
Don't worry about that

942
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:02,689
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

958
01:17:30,803 --> 01:17:31,756
需要茶水吗，夫人？
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?

959
01:17:32,202 --> 01:17:33,153
我自己来吧
I'll help myself.

969
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:23,007
我看了布告了
I've seen the placards

971
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:30,376
他们指的不是我
They don't mean me.

974
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:49,368
我的前任现在不仅活着，还活得好好的
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.

977
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:04,192
他已经不在了
He's not here anymore.

983
01:19:31,665 --> 01:19:33,040
你现在已经完全自己做主了，伯蒂
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

989
01:19:50,727 --> 01:19:51,705
伯蒂，你过来
Bertie, come here

1010
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:02,334

01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,244
欢迎您，陛下
Welcome your Majesty.

1030
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:41,113
罗格医生需要参加加冕礼
Dr. Logue will be attending the Coronation.

1034
01:22:56,216 --> 01:22:58,367
可您的家人将坐在那里，陛下
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.

1037
01:23:05,357 --> 01:23:07,502
这位先生，这里可是威斯敏斯特教堂！
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!

1038
01:23:07,886 --> 01:23:09,596
教会一定要为陛下做好准备
The Church must prepare his Majesty.

1039
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,029
我的准备同样重要
My preparations are equally important.

1041
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:23,574
这也是我的意思，大人
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1043
01:23:31,388 --> 01:23:31,879
陛下
Your Majesty.

1046
01:24:10,789 --> 01:24:12,089
准备好了？开始吧
Everything alright? Let's get cracking.

1065
01:25:37,268 --> 01:25:39,715
我尝试了肌肉治疗、练习、放松
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation,

1069
01:25:50,028 --> 01:25:51,829
我的工作，是给他们说话的自信
My job was to give them faith in their voice

1072
01:26:06,007 --> 01:26:07,256
你这样太拔高自己了
You give a very noble account of yourself.

1087
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:55,613
你让这国家的国王不能说话
you've saddle this nation with a voiceless King.

1097
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,863
人们还往上刻名字呢！
People have carved their name into it!

1108
01:27:59,318 --> 01:28:00,390
因为我有发表意见的权利！
Because I have a right to be heard!

1112
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:21,477
你是我认识的最勇敢的人
you're the bravest man I know.

1113
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:24,171
你会成为一个相当好的国王
you'll make a bloody good king.

1114
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:34,497
这究竟是怎么回事，陛下？
What on earth's going on, Sir?

1115
01:28:34,914 --> 01:28:35,968
大主教，没事的
It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1126
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:24,105

01:31:35,102 --> 01:31:37,720
非常好，非常好，大主教
Very good, very good. Archbishop.

1164
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,602
爸爸，他在说什么？
Papa, what's he saying?

1186
01:34:46,269 --> 01:34:47,943
稿子已经经过了审核
The wording is fully approved.

1187
01:34:48,686 --> 01:34:51,277
首相也会在广播节目中和您一起出席

那我就是历史上最庄重的国王了
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.

1233
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:27,861
这我做不成
I can't do this.

1239
01:39:02,892 --> 01:39:07,106
很高兴能这么快再次见面
Nice to see you again, so soon.

1251
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:09,070
亲爱的

来点新鲜空气

说给我这个朋友听

1304
01:48:18,385 --> 01:48:20,810
祝贺您，陛下，专业的播音员水准
