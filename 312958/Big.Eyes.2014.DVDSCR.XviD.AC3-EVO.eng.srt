15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,414
Come on, Jane.

16
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,533
North Beach, San Francisco

17
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:14,427
Sugar, you've made it, you're at North Beach!

18
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,111
Look at you, Dierdre!

19
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:17,653
DeeAnn.

20
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:21,965
I know, but I came on this scene, DeeAnn just sound like something my mom would call me.

21
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,580
So, are you flipping through all this? are you settled?

22
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,610
How is Jane? Well, Jane is well

23
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:30,316
She is going to this sweet little school, you know it's really hard without her father

24
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,726
- just don't know we gonna be able to...
- Stop.

25
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,192
You better off

26
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:36,266
To be honest, I never like Frank.

27
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,080
You are a bridesmaid.

28
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:39,851
Exactly, that's why I couldn't say anything.

29
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:42,893
But  if I see you run off again, I will tell you.

30
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,367
Now come on, let's have some fun.

31
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:46,993
For jazz, check out Hungry i.

32
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:48,313
For Italian, Vanessa.

33
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,215
For salvation, try the Buddhist Temple.

34
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,793
For Art, Six Gallery.

35
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,854
Today only show Modern?

36
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,348
Everyone only shows Modern.

37
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:56,641
And in basement, they have espresso.

38
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,904
Espresso, What's that, is it like whiffer?

39
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:00,651
You have a lot to learn.

40
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,810
<I> Back then, women didn't live... </ i>

41
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,327
<I> ...not without a job or prospects. </ I>

42
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,919
<I> All she has is her painting in the trunk. </ i>

43
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,185
<I> ...and her daughter in the back seat. </ I>

44
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,076
Good luck.

45
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,140
We don't get many ladies in here.

46
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,560
So your husband aproves you working?

47
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,797
My husband and I are seperated.

48
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,721
Seperated?

49
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:54,701
I realize I have no employment experience, but I really do need this job.

50
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,688
I have a daughter to support.

51
00:05:57,938 --> 00:06:00,909
I am not very good at tool knive and hone, but I do like to paint.

52
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:03,951
So I could just show you my portfolio.

53
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,966
I studied at the Watkins Art Institute, Nashville.

54
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,701
took some illustration classes in New York.

55
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:13,969
This is a soft pastel I did.

56
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:20,147
This is a charcoal portrait.

57
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,315
You do understand this is a furniture company?

58
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:05,739
- You see anything like?
- I like those over there.

59
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,690
They are relly neat.

60
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,458
Your stuff is cute.

61
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:11,702
Thank you.

62
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:12,694
How much?

63
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,928
Today's special, two dollars.

64
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:18,378
- I give you one.
- All right.

65
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:21,631
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead and have a seat.

66
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:23,770
What's your name?

67
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:26,041
- My name is Dolly.
- Dolly.

68
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,463
- How old are you?
- I'm 9 years old.

69
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:30,598
Nine years old.

70
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:37,589
- Looks like Monet. 
- Monet?

71
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,590
That's hell of a compliment.

72
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,755
If I may respectfully disagree, I'm more a traditional Pissarro

73
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,900
Come, come a little closer.

74
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,205
See these daring spacing, bold color!

75
00:07:57,654 --> 00:07:59,000
You wanna touch it?

76
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,932
Come on, come on, do it.

77
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,792
I don't lay it on thick, you not gonna break it.

78
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,077
It's $ 35.

79
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,361
Would you excuse me one second?

80
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,394
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

81
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:29,019
You're better than spare change.

82
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,225
Shouldn't sell youself so cheap.

83
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,301
Well I'm just glad he like it.

84
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,960
You past that point.

85
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,409
your heart is in your work.

86
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:41,942
What's your name?

87
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,107
Margaret

88
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,285
What would you rather have? flirting with those girls over there?

89
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,327
No, I, like you, Margaret ...

90
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,851
... Ulbrich.

91
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,117
You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you undervalue yourself.

92
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,201
Let me show you how is done.

93
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:05,527
Little girl!

94
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:09,633
How would you like your portrait sketched by ...

95
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,164
... world renowned Margaret Ulbrich,

96
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,182
... queen of the bay?

97
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,337
in mere minutes she capture you soul!

98
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:18,680
- Nah. 
- Why nay?

99
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:21,116
Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?

100
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,619
That is me.

101
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:24,088
And That's me ...

102
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:28,215
that starts is me, then mother change it into chinese boy.

103
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:30,700
My apology.

104
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,905
I misconstrue the situation.

105
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:38,324
I'd better mosey along before Mr. Olbrich comes back, socks me in the eye.

106
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:44,246
Mr. Olbrich is out of the picture

107
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:53,977
- Good evening, Henry!
- Mr. Keane!

108
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,307
Sorry for not calling first.

109
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,615
Let's see, your regular table is ready.

110
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,791
Madame, good evening,  follow me.

111
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,275
And I don't have to pay,  I'm set because I give a chef a painting.

112
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,966
- You know what he said?
- What?

113
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,560
He said, "no one paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!"

114
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,526
I can't believe you lived in Paris.

115
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,291
Best time of my life.

116
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,753
I never even on a airplane.

117
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,124
You have to experience these things.

118
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,778
You have to grab on.

119
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,793
I want to be a artist, I just went.

120
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,968
Studied painting at the Beaux Arts.

121
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:41,637
Live in the left bank studio, survive on bread and wine.

122
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:42,936
You are a romantic.

123
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,699
Damn right you are.

124
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,902
Of course, walking away from bourgeois things wasn't easy.

125
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,324
I have to quit my job.

126
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,530
Leave my wife.

127
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,600
Yeah, these choices aren't easy.

128
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,748
I never act freely.

129
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,141
I was a daughter, then wife ...

130
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,828
... then a mother.

131
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,704
All of my paintings are Jane, because she is all I know.

132
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,893
Don't knock off you work.

133
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:16,216
You have amazing talent.

134
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:20,247
You can look someone, capture them on canvas.

135
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,173
You can paint people.

136
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,537
I can only paint things.

137
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,723
Yeah, my street things are ...

138
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,924
... charming.

139
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,249
But, at the end of day, they are just collections of ...

140
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,040
... buildings and sidewalks.

141
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:38,276
Walter, I bet you can paint anything.

142
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:44,659
When you look at me like that, I could fall a lot hard.

143
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,056
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,320
This just moving really fast.

145
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,128
I haven't been on a date in a long time.

146
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:14,774
Jane, sweetie, stop wiggling.

147
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:18,243
Mother, after all these time you must know what my face looks like.

148
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,931
Hey, you canvas is blank.

149
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,118
You can't rush for inspiration.

150
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:31,133
Don't bother Mr. Keane, you know creativity come from within.

151
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,702
Don't worry, she is not bothering me.

152
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,957
Can I ask you a question.

153
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,155
What's that with big crazy eyes?

154
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,645
I believe you can see things in the eyes.

155
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,747
Eye is the window to the soul

156
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,903
Yeah, but you paint two pancakes.

157
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,375
Way out of proportion.

158
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:09,060
Eyes are how I express my emotions.

159
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,500
I always draw them like that.

160
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:14,689
When I was little, I had surgery left me deaf for a period.

161
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:18,718
I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring.

162
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,218
And idle on peoples' eyes.

163
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,657
Walter?

164
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,158
Hey, I thought that was you!

165
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,054
I am gald to see you.

166
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,250
Hey, any heard back from the city on that setback?

167
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,844
My guy really need versions for the forth floor retail.

168
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,069
- We will hear from permits by Thursday.
- Yeah, that's terrific, I'll tell the architect.

169
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,285
What was that?

170
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:53,221
I didn't want you to know.

171
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,786
I'm in comercial real estate.

172
00:13:58,314 --> 00:13:59,960
You're a realtor?

173
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:05,961
Yeah, hugely successful realtor, top earner, downtomn office.

174
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,177
Three years running.

175
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,646
And you are ashame?

176
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:14,394
Any blockhead can arrange a sublease.

177
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,100
All I ever wanted ...

178
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,575
... is to surpport myself as a artist.

179
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:24,864
Try to make a clear break, couldn't cut it.

180
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,371
I am just a sunday painter.

181
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,564
Thank you, just come right in here.

182
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,549
Just set it down over here ...

183
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:55,354
- Right here?
- Yeah, that's great, I just like to keep it out of the way.

184
00:14:56,593 --> 00:15:00,383
This is one of them I'm working on.

185
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,583
You can see I'm working on it.

186
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,626
I got the mail.

187
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,992
What's wrong?

188
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,978
Frank wants take Jane away.

189
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:59,639
- He say I'm a unfitted mother ...
- You're a perfect mother.

190
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:06,148
He told the court that she lacks a proper home ...

191
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:11,201
... it is beyond my capability as a single mother.

192
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,119
Marry me.

193
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:24,589
Don't think of a reason to say no, I got a million reasons to say yes.

194
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:29,010
- I know it makes no sense.
- no, it doesn't.

195
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,482
Just think the fun we'll have.

196
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,183
I'm gonna to take care of you girls.

197
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:44,321
Margaret, I'm on my knee, come on what do you say? let's get married!

198
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,183
We could be at Hawaii by the weekend.

199
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,706
Hawaii, marriage?

200
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:53,703
I don't know, Walter. I'm crazy about you, I'm just really overwhelmed righ now ...

201
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:56,045
... why we go to Hawaii, why?

202
00:16:56,545 --> 00:17:00,115
Because you're a pricess, you deserve to get married in paradise.

203
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:23,774
You were right, it's paradise.

204
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:26,874
Only God could creat these colours.

205
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,829
I knew you would love it.

206
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,456
Can we just stay here forever?

207
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,940
I don't know about forever, but I guess I could arrange for another week.

208
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,995
That's waterfall, and air is so fresh, you can taste it.

209
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,007
This is an ancient altar, that's a statue of Kane, the God of Creation.

210
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,008
I said a prayer to him.

211
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,841
That's Walter and Jane, they build that sand castle together.

212
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:38,320
Well, these just all happening mighty quick, by the time you moved here ...

213
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,649
... I had two days, you're already married.

214
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:44,303
Well, I thought there is a void in my life, and Walter fills it.

215
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:48,196
Walter fills a lot of things, he did every skirt in the acts.

216
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,247
That's my husband you're talking about.

217
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,618
I know, that's why I brought it up.

218
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,540
I'm not naive.

219
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:00,097
I am naive, but I know who I married.

220
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,462
Walter can be rush, but he is a good provider, and he is really wonderful with Jane.

221
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,834
We just looking to make a fresh start, I'm a divorcer with a child.

222
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,856
Walter is a blessing.

223
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:31,702
"You are on a threshold of untold success."

224
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,251
Its brilliant is about the compostion of spontaneity.

225
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,550
The image has no visual center for attention.

226
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:42,402
- It's quite gestural.
- Oh definitively, strongly influenced by Tachism.

227
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:45,798
I heard Tab Hunter was in here looking at one.

228
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,799
Well, I am not allow to say.

229
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:57,785
For Christ!

230
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:00,298
Don't come in here, not now, please ...

231
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:03,736
Ruben, good day, you got a minute?

232
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,829
Walter, polite to say, the word is appointment.

233
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,349
I can come back later.

234
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:12,536
You gonna love my stuff today.

235
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,706
Have I not seen that one before?

236
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:25,732
No, that was painted in the fifth arrondissement, this is sixth arrondissement.

237
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,412
I don't understand. you lived in Paris for a week, how can you still be cranking out paintings?

238
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,145
It's all up here, and here.

239
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,832
That's not going up here.

240
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,945
Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz, you're too literal.

241
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:40,693
- Art is a fashion.
- Yes it is!

242
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,963
People want Kandinsky or Rothko, they don't want goofy street scene.

243
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,153
How about this.

244
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:04,623
Good God, you enter a new period.

245
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,588
They are my wife's.

246
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,245
Why are their eyes so big?

247
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,932
Like they steal jelly beans.

248
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:20,058
It's expressionism, truly a recognized.

249
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,362
Well, I'm just glad your two found each other.

250
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,905
- So what do you say?
- I say no, it's not art.

251
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,370
- It's not art?
- Like a back of magzine, you know.

252
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:34,184
"Draw a turtle, send a nickel, win the big contest."

253
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:36,455
How dire you? lots of people will like these.

254
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,987
Well, nobody who walks in the door of this gallery.

255
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,112
Now, please clear out the clunker before taste police arrive.

256
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,416
We never break in.

257
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,563
It's a secret society of gallery owners and critics.

258
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,545
Who get together for sunday brunch at Sausalito to deciding what's cool.

259
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:17,193
Like McCarthy hearings "I knowing that painter, I banish that painter to nowhere."

260
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,626
I think people buy art because it touches them.

261
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,310
Yeah, you're living in fairy land.

262
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:29,498
People don't get to discovery anythings, they buy arts because ...

263
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,322
... it's in the right place at right time.

264
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,946
Ok, give it up for Cal Jader

265
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,164
Be sure to stick around for 1 am show.

266
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:59,956
Hey Banducci, I love the music tonight, it's aghast.

267
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,782
Thanks, thank you.

268
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,431
Walter Keane, I'm a painter.

269
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,697
I was looking at your walls, they are pretty plain.

270
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:10,826
Oh maybe you're right.

271
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,590
What color would you think?

272
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:14,884
No, I'm a artist

273
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,418
I used to base on left bank.

274
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:24,067
Now I relocate to the States, I'm looking for an exhibition venue.

275
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:26,435
I like my club the way it is.

276
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,264
The stuff is so hot, don't put it into a museum.

277
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,350
OK, I respect that, you're a business man.

278
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,167
Not a charity.

279
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,794
How about if I rent your walls?

280
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,453
Walter, Margaret, we're ready.

281
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,583
Ah, an art lover, beautiful!

282
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:20,955
What can I do for you sir?

283
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:22,728
I am just looking for the junk

284
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:25,597
Thanks.

285
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:03,680
Look at that child!

286
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:06,743
She so sad.

287
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:10,964
- Is she poor?
- She is forgotten.

288
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,921
Just make me wanna cry.

289
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,339
Are you Keane?

290
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:20,432
Yes, I am.

291
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,546
You are hell of a painter.

292
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:25,807
Thank you, thank you very much.

293
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,354
Your work is very powerful.

294
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:32,509
There is so much emotion in those eyes.

295
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,933
- Is something wrong?
- No.

296
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:41,698
I didn't realize you mean that waif.

297
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,547
I get it, the artist doesn't want to part with his favorite piece.

298
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,652
Oh sweetie, thank you! I love it!

299
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,282
Hey, Picasso!

300
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,283
Nice crowd, Huh?

301
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,627
You wouldn't know from that brown closet you pack me in.

302
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:15,377
What do you talk about? That plan is thoroughly.

303
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,835
People drink, they gonna relieve themselves.

304
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,189
That's insulting.

305
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,072
When people see art, they shouldn't think their shit.

306
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,470
Hey, why your use proper language.

307
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,471
Hey, there's lady present here.

308
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,032
BISTRO BRAWL: BANDUCCI AND ARTIST SLUGFEST

309
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:42,947
I have never post a bail before.

310
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:43,778
Sorry.

311
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:46,601
Banducci laugh at our arts, I socked him.

312
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,258
Since when do you thin skin?

313
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,881
Artists have to handle critic.

314
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,165
I know, I know, you're right.

315
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,071
I was at a bad place already.

316
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:56,779
I had a couple of men, I made some guy believe I painted your big eyes.

317
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:57,826
What?

318
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,917
I don't understand, why would you do such thing?

319
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:03,022
It was a misunderstanding.

320
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,363
And then I didn't want to risk the sell.

321
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:09,708
Well, don't ever do it again.

322
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:21,825
Don't give me a hard time, I'm just grabbing my stuff.

323
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:28,321
Can you believe it?

324
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,755
We sold out, I don't even have a headliner.

325
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,756
Hell it's monday!

326
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:36,197
Walter, we made the front page.

327
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,422
People are here because they want to see that sappy painting...

328
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,805
... that made grown man fight.

329
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,965
- I'm sick of you, Keane!
- I'll see you in court gate!

330
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:52,377
- You son of a bitch! I'll sue you ...
- I'm sick of you and your paintings!

331
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:55,354
I'll sue you for slander!

332
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,739
<I> Walter Keane was not a subtle man. </ I>

333
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,577
<I> But subtle dosen't sell. </ I>

334
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:20,935
Yes sir, that was quite a lot horse shit you just relate out there.

335
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,592
I'm Dick Nolan, Examiner.

336
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,620
Hey pal, I don't lose any sleep. I eat stuff from spoon.

337
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,821
Give me something to write about. my column.

338
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:34,663
I thought you were only doing celebrities

339
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,471
Banducci is famous, and you hit him.

340
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:39,456
So you're a celebrity worth snoop.

341
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:42,266
Buy me a drink.

342
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:48,579
Hi, Gary, I like a ... , and my friend will have the same.

343
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,979
So, Walter, tell me about your work.

344
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,753
When I was in Paris ...

345
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,619
No, no jesus not those.

346
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:06,159
I mean the little hobo kids.

347
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:24,804
Wake up.

348
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,127
You were a hit.

349
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:33,779
What a night.

350
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,198
I sold out all your <Big Eyes>.

351
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:37,902
$ 200.

352
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:40,498
They adore you!

353
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,499
Because of that article, the joint was packed.

354
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:49,505
There are famous journalists, sold all of it. I need more paintings!

355
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,606
...

356
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,459
This is a opportunity, we gonna make a cracker jack team!

357
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:07,575
Me show them in the club, you got here doing what you love.

358
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,264
Get out of here.

359
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,297
I love you.

360
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:35,297
The eyes are so powerful.

361
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:37,954
You know a poet once said ...

362
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:41,109
... The eyes are the windows of the soul.

363
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,797
That's why I paint them so big, I always done it that way.

364
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:47,589
If you're interested in that style, one of new pieces.

365
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:51,955
I have a little blond girl in a yellow dress.

366
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,030
It'll tear you heart out.

367
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:57,981
Baby, what're you doing here?

368
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,732
Why are you lying?

369
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:04,670
Excuse me.

370
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,327
You are taking credit for something that isn't yours.

371
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,628
I'm just trying close a deal.

372
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,983
These children are part of my being.

373
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:17,435
I must say, you know buyers would pay more if they meet the painter.

374
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,193
They couldn't meet me because you told me to stay home.

375
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,084
Look, we're making money.

376
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,774
Your pocket, my pocket, where is the difference?

377
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,049
You're taking this so lightly.

378
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,270
Not at all, this is not about ego.

379
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:30,648
You want to say you did the street scene, that's fine.

380
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,835
I don't care,say a monkey painted them.

381
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:36,967
Oh God, you could just dash your word without any emotional connection.

382
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:41,887
Honey, I just wanna share it with the world.

383
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:45,582
Would you rather your children pouting in closet ...

384
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,744
... or hanging in someone's living room

385
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:56,026
Who is that man?

386
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,034
That is Dino Olivetti.

387
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,408
Don't even think about, Walter, he doeson't speak  lack of english.

388
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:36,321
Mr Olivetti is enchanted by the painting, he would like to know who is the artist.

389
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,506
I am.

390
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:30,327
Five grands!

391
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:33,813
We made  5000 dollors!

392
00:34:34,262 --> 00:34:36,574
That was not even for one of your good ones.

393
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,505
Don't you mean your good one?

394
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,764
No!

395
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,951
Our, one of our good ones.

396
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:47,557
We now hanging in the collection of italian industrialist Dino Olivetti.

397
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,107
With his patronize comes credibility.

398
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:53,239
With credibility, comes respect.

399
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:55,371
What about honesty?

400
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:57,206
All our paintings say Keane.

401
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:00,242
I'm Keane, you're Keane.

402
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:03,255
From now on, we're one of the same.

403
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:16,761
<I> My source tell me the mayor expect big surprise today. </ I>

404
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,838
On behalf of the children of the world, I pesent this painting ...

405
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,306
... to the mayor of San Francisco.

406
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:31,286
<I> My man on the street tells me Soviet ambassador in town as speak. </ I>

407
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,543
In the interest of peace throught culture ...

408
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,918
... I donate this painting to the people of Soviet Union.

409
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,266
The Purple Onion, 21:30, Joan Crawford have dinner reservation.

410
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:51,905
Mrs. Crawford, in recognition of your cinematic craft ...

411
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:54,921
... we bestow with this painting of you!

412
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,453
<I> The cat is out of the bag. </ I>

413
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:05,114
<I> I can revail our local luminary Walter Kean is open his own gallery. </ I>

414
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,742
Ruben gonna choke when he see these.

415
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:18,424
I remember my mom painted that.

416
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:26,847
Are you sure? that would been awhile ago.

417
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,600
Sure it is.

418
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:31,205
It was at old apartment you had me sit still in the kitchen.

419
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:34,291
No, sweetie, you're comfused. I painted that.

420
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:37,364
No, mother did, I wear my wool dress.

421
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,708
Lots of girls have that dress.

422
00:36:42,364 --> 00:36:44,301
You have a good eye.

423
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:47,490
I painted it, and try to mimic your mom's style

424
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,294
You know, the style she used to paint.

425
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,270
You did a really good job.

426
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:14,734
Hello.

427
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,929
I'm sorry, I've never done this before.

428
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,477
I was raised Methodist, so if that's a problem I could go.

429
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:26,130
No no, please, we don't chase people away.

430
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:29,479
What is troubling you?

431
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,166
I lie to my child.

432
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,355
Why did you do that?

433
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,489
My husband he pressure me to do it.

434
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:45,465
I just never lie to her, I am not that kind of person.

435
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,702
Is your husban that kind of person?

436
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,991
I don't think him that way.

437
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:56,456
He likes to tell stories, and he exaggerates about.

438
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,014
He is a good man.

439
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,394
He just try to save enough money to buy a house for the family.

440
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:07,751
But what about the chlid, will this lie bring harm to her?

441
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:09,944
Harm? no, no.

442
00:38:13,988 --> 00:38:15,929
I'm just looking for some answers.

443
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,695
Well, the modern world is a complex place.

444
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,719
Occasionally, children may need to be sheltered from certain truth.

445
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:29,611
No, it's not like ...

446
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:33,237
It sounds if your husband is to try to make the best of ...

447
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:35,282
... a imperfect situation.

448
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,028
You were raised Christian, you know we were taught ...

449
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,332
... man is the head of a household.

450
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,798
Perhaps  you should trust his judgement.

451
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,114
Keane Gallery, Opening Night, 1960

452
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:56,797
I think it's creepy, modern, and amateurish.

453
00:38:57,332 --> 00:38:58,623
Exactly.

454
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:00,414
I love it.

455
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,492
We got here early, we are three.

456
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,880
Thanks.

457
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:21,255
Hey, baby! killer party, it's happening

458
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,568
So, where is your stuff?

459
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:27,862
We decided this just be Walter show.

460
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,950
Well, he did? why would he do that?

461
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,550
Oh, because Walter is more established.

462
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:38,503
Strange you know, Walter doesn't really strike me ...

463
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,580
... as cute hungry kids type.

464
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:44,661
It's really good to see you.

465
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,645
Thank you for coming.

466
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:54,228
Your husband's quite a talent.

467
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:57,834
Do you paint too?

468
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:03,924
I don't know.

469
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,790
I'm curious about your technique.

470
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,056
How long that piece take to excute?

471
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:19,909
Probably a month.

472
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:25,949
First, thinking, sketching, then the time just me and oil.

473
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,902
Oil? but is it acrylics?

474
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,907
That? yeah!

475
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:37,907
It's just like a jumbo ideas rattling aroung in my brain.

476
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,952
So where did you get your ideas?

477
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:45,909
What do you mean?

478
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:51,237
I mean why are they all images of the children?

479
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:57,137
May I remind you, Mrs. Rogers,  you sworn under the oath.

480
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:03,637
Mrs Rogers, you testify that ...

481
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:08,137
When you met Jason Bailey Crowley, he's been talking to a man at the bar.

482
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:10,237
I don't understand.

483
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:14,237
Couldn't it be just some stranger who just struck a conversation with Mr. bailey?

484
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:17,637
- No!
- Thank you, Mrs. Roger, that would be all.

485
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:21,304
<I> Perry Mason  will return after this. </ I>

486
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:24,070
<I> New York Times art critic John Canaday ... </ i>

487
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,180
<I> ... with a perspective into the work of Walter Keane </ I>

488
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:29,990
<I> Keane's work is completely without distinction. </ I>

489
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:33,056
<I> He is not a member of society western artists. </ I>

490
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,055
<I> He's won no awards. </ I>

491
00:41:35,445 --> 00:41:40,135
<I> He's only known to others for his appearence in certain newspaper's gossip columns. </ I>

492
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,267
<I> Mr. Keane is why society need critics. </ I>

493
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:47,374
<I> to protect them from such atrocities. </ I>

494
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,478
Mom!

495
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:54,089
Mom, can I come in?

496
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,415
No, you can't, mom is busy right now.

497
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:03,634
What're you doing?

498
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,171
Jane, sweetie, come.

499
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:16,137
You need to respect your mother's privacy.

500
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:19,205
Sometimes grown-up need their own time.

501
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:31,235
Is that the  icecream truck?

502
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:38,410
Go get youself a ...

503
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:50,633
Out of this world!

504
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,810
I don't know.

505
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:56,484
I'm not comfortable with this, Jane and I were really close, now ...

506
00:42:57,757 --> 00:42:59,020
Jane is fine.

507
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:03,692
She is eating icecream, she hasn't assume she even has a college fund.

508
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:08,671
Maybe I'm just light-headed from all this turpentine ...

509
00:43:08,814 --> 00:43:10,396
... up here all day

510
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:12,399
I need you help.

511
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:15,055
I want to go on television to defend our art.

512
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:18,588
Wait, you going on the television?

513
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,790
Yeah, but what am I gonna say?

514
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,250
Meaning what compells me to painted these things?

515
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:30,764
Maybe you have a unhealthy obession with little girls.

516
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:34,034
- Cute.
- I'm sorry.

517
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:36,944
Looks like "you pin youself into a corner"

518
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,166
Yeah, you want heat this winter, help me out.

519
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:43,774
Walter, art is personal.

520
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:51,638
What compells a grown man to paint a picture like this?

521
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:56,481
Because I grew up surrounded by six sisters.

522
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,431
I grew up in a orphanage.

523
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,998
I lived at a world where adult had vanished ...

524
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:09,771
... and kids and kittens run wild over desolate landscape?

525
00:44:11,197 --> 00:44:13,324
What about your street scenes? why did you paint these?

526
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,384
Well I lived it, I experienced it.

527
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:20,729
Was it all sunlight dappled streets and flower venders?

528
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:22,121
Of course not.

529
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,785
It was after war.

530
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:32,451
There was destruction everywhere.

531
00:44:34,857 --> 00:44:40,684
I traveled continent, the ravages were horrifying.

532
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:44,707
My psyche was scarred in my art student days.

533
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:50,841
Nothing in my life has ever made such a impact as the sight of children.

534
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,094
The war racked innocents without parents, without home.

535
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,248
Fighting over garbage.

536
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:05,911
That's when my life as a painter began at earliest.

537
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:14,712
From then on, I painted lost children with big eyes.

538
00:45:17,056 --> 00:45:20,786
Those eyes forever will retain their haunting quality

539
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:02,138
How many sales today?

540
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,866
Sales? none with this crowd.

541
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:08,335
Those people all lowly looks, they can't afford these paintings.

542
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:11,017
But we have been giving away a lot of posters.

543
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:22,848
Craziest thing!

544
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:25,777
I started charging for the posters.

545
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,854
First a nickel, then a dime, yes, it's cool!

546
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:37,069
But, then it got me thinking, would you rather sell one $ 500 painting ...

547
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:40,050
... or millions cheaply reproduced posters?

548
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,221
See, folks don't care it's a copy.

549
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,754
They just want art that touches them.

550
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,493
Then we could sell it to anywhere.

551
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,193
Eeverywhere!

552
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:46,593
<I> Lana Del Rey - Big Eyes </I>
<I> ... I used to think I could trust you. </I>

553
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:51,793
<I> I was your woman. </I>

554
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:56,793
<I> You were my knight </I>

555
00:47:57,993 --> 00:48:01,093
<I> shining companion. </I>

556
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:07,693
<I> To my surprise, my loves demise. </I>

557
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:12,693
<I> Was his own greed and lullaby. </I>

558
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:22,093
<I> With your big eyes, and your big lies. </I>

559
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:32,093
<I> With your big eyes, and your big lies ... </I>

560
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:36,157
Stinks here, you should open a window.

561
00:48:36,968 --> 00:48:38,163
What time is it?

562
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:39,789
6:30.

563
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:42,400
What you got back there? let me see.

564
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:44,149
Walter, it's personal.

565
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:48,063
Personal, we married! we're not suppose to have secret from each other.

566
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:49,401
Put it out there.

567
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:02,057
It's completely diferent style.

568
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:04,985
Yes, it is.

569
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:06,901
Kind of looks like you.

570
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:10,090
Well, it's a self portrait.

571
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,761
How am I gonna explain that?

572
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:18,523
I was thinking that ...

573
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,580
... maybe I could sigh it myself.

574
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:25,903
That sounds a bit comfusing? doesn't it?

575
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:28,614
Keane means me.

576
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,531
I know, but when people asks me if I paint ...

577
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,031
... I don't know how to answer it.

578
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:36,343
It would be nice to have a pride being able to say that's mine.

579
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:38,208
Who you tells about "Big Eyes"?

580
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:39,787
Nobody.

581
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:40,545
If you tell anyone ...

582
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,879
... this empire collapses!

583
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,989
You wanna give back the money?

584
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:48,514
- We could become Fraud!
- I know!

585
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:52,805
My God, I know, I live with this every minute of my life.

586
00:49:54,173 --> 00:50:00,080
I hold my end of the bargain, I have not told anyone.

587
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:05,297
Please, just let me handle this.

588
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,679
I don't know you painted, Margeret.

589
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:10,581
Yeah, we don't know about that.

590
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,097
Sadly, people don't buy lady art.

591
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,474
What about Georgia O'Keeffe?

592
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,471
So, Margaret, where did you get your ideas?

593
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,885
From the world around me ...

594
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:30,186
... and I just love Modigliani.

595
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,467
"Monti" ... what?

596
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:33,811
For Christ's sake, Margaret!

597
00:50:34,082 --> 00:50:35,156
Dick writes gossip column.

598
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:36,770
Stick to the family angle.

599
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,332
Get a angle over little Janey over here.

600
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,741
What a talent!

601
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:43,522
Look at these Keanes!

602
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:46,273
When you cut open our veins, we bleed oil!

603
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:56,208
Ah, little treat.

604
00:50:57,043 --> 00:51:00,729
The forth member of the painting Keane.

605
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:03,514
Lily, sweetie, how are you?

606
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,995
I'm fine dad, I lost a tooth.

607
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:08,315
Really?

608
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:10,554
You getting into a fight?

609
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,479
No, it fell out.

610
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:18,385
Well, is the tooth fairy something I have to deal with? or your mom alreay handled it?

611
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,315
She handled it.

612
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,317
Good, good, good!

613
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:27,957
Janey, come, show her the kids room.

614
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:31,971
And then you girls can join the fun.

615
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:40,969
Hey, Walter, you never told me you had another daughter.

616
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,031
Didn't I? sure.

617
00:51:44,629 --> 00:51:46,512
Lily is from my first marriage.

618
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:53,419
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.

619
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:58,569
Walter, may I have a word with you?

620
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,949
- What is going on in here?
- That's Lily.

621
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:07,684
I'm sure mentioned her.

622
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,239
No, you didn't.

623
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:13,032
- Is she moving in?
- No.

624
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,418
Her mother has gone to Vegas for the weekend.

625
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:17,127
I supposed to have her once a month ...

626
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:18,433
... but I don't make her mom ...

627
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,804
How could you lie about something so big?

628
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:23,176
- Oh she is a very sweet girl.
- I'm sure she is.

629
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:26,067
Well I put up with your daughter, never said a peep.

630
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:28,903
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

631
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,099
I'm sorry.

632
00:52:32,509 --> 00:52:34,743
Please, let's just get through this.

633
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:47,443
... Walter Keane and Paul Gauguin have a lot in common.

634
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:51,443
Both walk away from a career to travel the globe ...

635
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:55,084
<I> I've learn a lot of famous personalities. </ I>

636
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:58,325
<I> Only a certain type of creature can live in that spotlight. </ I>

637
00:52:58,773 --> 00:53:00,399
<I> Walter had a chops. </ I>

638
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,605
<I> Margaret not so much. </ I>

639
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:08,036
- I painted that.
- really?

640
00:53:09,422 --> 00:53:12,132
It's very evocative.

641
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:15,090
sensual.

642
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,790
MDH

643
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:27,295
You're so mystery.

644
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,052
Yes, we don't use my name since people don't ...

645
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,521
... take women's art seriously.

646
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:37,440
MDH is my initials.

647
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:42,955
And more, I'm really interested in numerology, you know 7 is a really good number.

648
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,327
7?

649
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:48,660
Luckily, my main name is Margaret Doris Hawkins

650
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:52,642
"M" is the 13 letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8.

651
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,950
And you add that up 1 and 3 in 13 ...

652
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,142
an orgy of color!

653
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:00,663
Excuse me.

654
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:04,469
Which makes 4 plus 4 plus 8 equal 16.

655
00:54:04,604 --> 00:54:07,005
And 1 plus 6 equal 7.

656
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,647
Magrate, one second?

657
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,320
Good God, what did you think about? longer vision?

658
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,083
Could you please help the world and shut your mouth.

659
00:54:18,832 --> 00:54:21,539
The only number you want in his head  ... is the price.

660
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:24,011
Two nuts fell from the same tree.

661
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,698
It's insufferable.

662
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:27,728
Why are we starving while they print money?

663
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:30,238
Because that's how genius sells paintings.

664
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:34,662
And they sell pictures of the paintings, then they sell postcard of the pictures of the paintings.

665
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:37,265
I bet I could bang one out in 10 minutes.

666
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:39,486
Wouldn't you have to dealt with the sincerity.

667
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:40,770
Well the costumer wouldn't notice.

668
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:49,052
Christ ... it's a movement.

669
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,786
KEANE TAKES ON ART WORLD

670
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:54,714
The Man Behind The Eyes

671
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:56,631
ARITST KING KEANE

672
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:10,429
Woodside, California 1963

673
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:23,610
My God! I thought I had the wrong address.

674
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:26,690
I know it's a really long drive.

675
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,445
Honestly I can't believe I live here.

676
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:32,515
I know.

677
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:36,630
- You got two acres.
- A pool, Five bedrooms.

678
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,222
I thought it was excessive.

679
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:42,455
Since there is only three of us here.

680
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:45,736
Been so long since I see you.

681
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:47,384
I know

682
00:55:47,419 --> 00:55:50,914
North beach is 30 miles, might as well be 300.

683
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:54,439
Well, you probably busy hanging out with all your new rich buddies.

684
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:56,639
Please! those are Walter's friends.

685
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,452
He brings people by.

686
00:55:58,716 --> 00:56:00,341
The Beach Boys came by.

687
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,218
Are you hungry?

688
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,751
I'm thirsty.

689
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,243
When I moved in, I thought a wet bar is kind extravagant.

690
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,492
But you would be surprise how much issues can get out of it.

691
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,908
So how is Walter?

692
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:21,057
He couldn't be happier.

693
00:56:21,814 --> 00:56:23,749
He has everything he's ever dreamed of.

694
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:26,453
So do you, fabulous!

695
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:32,778
Is that your arts studio?

696
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:36,908
- You don't want to go in there.
- I wanna take a peek.

697
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:40,766
I want to see what work phase of wildly successful artist looks like.

698
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:42,366
No no no...

699
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,278
DeeAnn, Please do not go down there.

700
00:56:47,753 --> 00:56:49,585
You can't go in there.

701
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:55,587
Walter paints here too.

702
00:56:57,645 --> 00:56:59,257
Is Walter home now?

703
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,241
What the hell is going on?

704
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:04,316
Nothing.

705
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:08,782
I just invite DeeAnn over.

706
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,943
You know I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done.

707
00:57:34,672 --> 00:57:38,349
You and your all none representation crap are fraud!

708
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:40,328
Shut up, you're so full of shit! Walter.

709
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:41,414
Get out of my house ...

710
00:57:41,649 --> 00:57:43,431
... get out of my big house!

711
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:46,691
Go back selling your sculpture ...

712
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,116
... in fishmen's wharf!

713
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:49,437
Fuck you!

714
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,128
I don't want her ever invited here.

715
00:57:58,104 --> 00:57:59,563
I won't.

716
00:58:10,178 --> 00:58:12,246
- All right Jane, I'm get to work.
- Can I come?

717
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,328
No, I can't ever come.

718
00:58:15,005 --> 00:58:16,703
No, I shouldn't even ask.

719
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:35,631
How did you get in here?

720
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,438
Didn't you hear that there is no visitors.

721
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,204
This is what it comes to, huh!

722
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,569
You're the only living soul I can tell my secret to.

723
00:58:50,644 --> 00:58:51,945
Well, I painted them.

724
00:58:52,757 --> 00:58:55,832
I did ... every single one of them.

725
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,519
Every "Big Eyes".

726
00:58:57,521 --> 00:58:58,632
Me.

727
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,426
But no one will ever know but you.

728
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:05,762
I'm gonna paint another one right now.

729
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:07,866
Take Walter off ...

730
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:10,453
... I'll paint one about a crazy girl talking to a dog.

731
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:27,341
Productive day today.

732
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,994
Stumble on some hot gossip.

733
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:35,434
Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town ...

734
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:37,310
... straight from Taipei.

735
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:43,417
I think we should present her with a painting, get Dick to flack it.

736
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:48,476
Well, hell with Dick, I met a new guy at UPI

737
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:52,426
Maybe she'll like one of your street scenes.

738
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,095
Yeah, I don't know.

739
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:58,687
I thought you could rip off a doodler of china town with a cute little girl.

740
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:01,341
Sort of big eye slanting eye thing.

741
01:01:02,764 --> 01:01:03,984
No.

742
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:06,425
She is a dignitary.

743
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,903
She deserve a piece come straight from you.

744
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:13,267
You think?

745
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,706
Maybe you're right.

746
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:20,465
She probably doesn't has a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace.

747
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:23,426
Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a S. Cenic.

748
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,966
- What's that?
- A S.Cenic.

749
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:31,687
That's the painter that painted all your early work.

750
01:01:39,646 --> 01:01:41,147
It's scenic.

751
01:01:42,355 --> 01:01:43,831
That's my nickname in Paris.

752
01:01:44,302 --> 01:01:47,328
All my art school pals love my scenic view so much.

753
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:49,617
They call me, well they couldn't pronouce properly ...

754
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,355
... so they call me S. Cenic.

755
01:01:53,617 --> 01:01:55,484
The more you lie, the smaller you seem.

756
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:58,885
How dare you accused me of lying?

757
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:00,851
I'm proud of my early scenics.

758
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,563
Then why did you painted over the name?

759
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,032
Piece of advice ...

760
01:02:04,182 --> 01:02:05,617
... never use water base over nowhere ...

761
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,521
... I'm just flay right off.

762
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:10,761
You sound like crazy for God's sake.

763
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:12,767
You see me paint.

764
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:16,058
No, I haven't

765
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,528
I always thought ... I had ...

766
01:02:20,994 --> 01:02:22,649
... but it's like a mirage.

767
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:25,673
I'm in distance, you look like a painter.

768
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:28,656
Up close, there is not much there.

769
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:32,496
I've been to Paris!

770
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:35,330
I studied at the Beaux Arts!

771
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:36,747
At grande Chaumiere!

772
01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:43,390
I spent hours and hours at the Louvre staring at the great of the masters!

773
01:02:46,515 --> 01:02:48,900
Have you even been to Paris?

774
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:06,912
I wanted it, I so wanted to become a artist, just never turn out so well.

775
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:21,493
I don't want you sleep here any longer.

776
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:25,128
There are three extra bedroom in this house, go pick one.

777
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:51,365
- How many more this under back?
- I don't know, maybe 3000?

778
01:03:52,073 --> 01:03:53,863
- Does the printer ...
- Excuse me, Mrs.

779
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:57,132
- How much this painting?
- Go! what do I pay you for?

780
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,540
Not even one of mine, one of hers.

781
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:10,571
1964 New York World's Fair
Construction Races Toward April Opening

782
01:04:16,804 --> 01:04:18,545
This doesn't change anything.

783
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:23,149
- I know the truth.
- Oh who cares?

784
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:28,734
Maybe it's time to shake things off, start putting my name under the MDHs.

785
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:29,973
No.

786
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:33,500
Absolutely not, I already hate myself giving you the waifs.

787
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,027
Quiet!

788
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:41,981
- Don't raise your voice.
- I will talk as loud as I want.

789
01:04:42,439 --> 01:04:45,780
No, you won't, or I have you whacked.

790
01:04:47,213 --> 01:04:48,429
What?

791
01:04:48,888 --> 01:04:51,958
If you tell anyone, I'll have you taking ？...

792
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,726
I know people, remember Banducci's cousin? liquor wholesaler.

793
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:58,943
Are you threatening me?

794
01:05:00,324 --> 01:05:02,199
Fine, kill me.

795
01:05:03,353 --> 01:05:06,420
My God, I keep our secret for years, never once ...

796
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:11,178
You know how hard this is been for me?

797
01:05:13,438 --> 01:05:14,702
I don't have any friends.

798
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:18,003
I lie to my own child.

799
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,734
Life imitating art, a crying Keane.

800
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,506
Walter, what do you want?

801
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:34,611
Everything was your calculated.

802
01:05:34,862 --> 01:05:36,580
We're back where we have our first date.

803
01:05:42,593 --> 01:05:46,140
I don't deny I need you, you're the one with the gift.

804
01:05:47,799 --> 01:05:49,849
Now there is a shot ...

805
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:52,684
I'm shaking, I'm so exciting!

806
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,485
The New York World's Fair.

807
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:58,037
70 millions visitors.

808
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:01,089
Opening day I unveil my master piece.

809
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:03,824
- What master piece?
- Exact.

810
01:06:04,788 --> 01:06:06,344
What have we been listening all this time?

811
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:10,615
Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa, Renoir has his Boatmen's lunch.

812
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,047
Where is my defining statement?

813
01:06:13,282 --> 01:06:15,440
You sound insane.

814
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:18,711
Artist doesn't just annouce his master piece.

815
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:19,664
Why not?

816
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:24,635
Didn't Michelangelo know he is hitting a home run when he's on his back painting Sistine Chapel?

817
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:26,180
That take him four years.

818
01:06:27,178 --> 01:06:29,021
But there is the best part.

819
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:31,830
It's for Unicef!

820
01:06:31,865 --> 01:06:34,901
Unicef sponsors the hall of education.

821
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:38,328
We can finally give back to the children of the world.

822
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:43,934
WORLD'S FAIR REPORT WITH LOWELL THOMAS

823
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:45,534
<I> Hello, everybody. </ I>

824
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,092
<I> I'm Lowell Thomas. </ I>

825
01:06:47,427 --> 01:06:49,535
<I> Standing in front one of what will soon be ... </ I>

826
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:52,035
<I> ... one of the wonders of the modern world. </ I>

827
01:07:09,478 --> 01:07:11,547
<I> When people asked me why did she stay. </ I>

828
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:14,348
<I> Was it fear, lack of confidence? </ i>

829
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:17,135
<I> Margaret was trapped in the lie that she helped creat. </ I>

830
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,856
<I> Another cover up is worth than a crime. </ I>

831
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:24,854
Why did you have to promise them similar the size?

832
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:28,949
Because it has encompass all children, all races.

833
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:33,321
Hundreds of stricken faces marching to infinity.

834
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:35,608
The ultimate of the Walter Keane.

835
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,958
A publicist says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book.

836
01:07:40,443 --> 01:07:43,347
You know, 『Classy』, 『Tomorrow's  Masters』.

837
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:48,369
They need my early portfolio, artistic evolution.

838
01:07:48,515 --> 01:07:51,016
Yes, where are all of your preliminary sketches?

839
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:55,097
All that time you spent in art school seem to ...

840
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:58,542
... well laid all of your useful experiment, all these unfinished charcoals.

841
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,912
Could be around here somewhere.

842
01:08:04,717 --> 01:08:07,510
I know you been sarcastic, these are good idea.

843
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:11,296
Put in more orphans, early self portraits.

844
01:08:12,078 --> 01:08:14,145
Get out here, I'm try to work.

845
01:08:18,197 --> 01:08:21,248
Mom, what about dinner?

846
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,812
Mom, are you home?

847
01:09:20,496 --> 01:09:23,411
Jane, this is Walter's studio, you need to leave.

848
01:09:24,484 --> 01:09:27,786
Mom, I know.

849
01:09:29,638 --> 01:09:31,138
No, you don't know anything.

850
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:33,329
I'm not a child anymore.

851
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,208
Five... six pages. Is something here I missing?

852
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:04,443
He's like the hula hoop, he just won't go away!

853
01:10:06,003 --> 01:10:09,240
" ... will be unveil in the grand pavilion of the hall of education ... "

854
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:13,927
" ... internationally celebrated artists been selected ... "

855
01:10:14,722 --> 01:10:17,502
" ... will represent the aspiration of the children worldwide. "

856
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:19,759
This is absurd!

857
01:10:28,928 --> 01:10:31,524
Under who was on selection committee?

858
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:35,045
Oh, there wasn't a committee precede.

859
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:40,349
We just had luncheon, with me, Ed, and Jerome, Jerome's wife ...

860
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,316
Though technically we didn't invite submissions.

861
01:10:44,016 --> 01:10:46,416
Mr. Keane just contact us directly.

862
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,118
New York City, April. 1964

863
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:54,727
Come on.

864
01:10:55,692 --> 01:10:59,393
Wednesday the World's Fair opens, Thursday our books on sell.

865
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:02,015
Friday I file for divorce.

866
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:05,310
Why are you always so miserable?

867
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,953
Well, I'm going to enjoy my afternoon.

868
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,324
Mrs. Tisdale, Walter Keane.

869
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:23,604
I just want to thank you  for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree.

870
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,937
You're most welcome.

871
01:11:28,768 --> 01:11:30,980
Keane, did you see the Times?

872
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:35,937
Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely occasion.

873
01:11:36,468 --> 01:11:38,593
I think you should read the Times.

874
01:12:00,093 --> 01:12:02,193
Art: World's Fair Pavilion Selects Theme Painting

875
01:12:03,075 --> 01:12:05,885
Appalling, grotesque, tasteless hack.

876
01:12:06,123 --> 01:12:08,071
How can somebody say something so cruel?

877
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:11,831
Why do you care? this my name being drag through mud.

878
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:14,750
Is he here?

879
01:12:15,392 --> 01:12:18,220
Yes, which is perhaps why it's best for everybody if ...

880
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:26,097
Who wrote this shit?

881
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:31,934
Mr. Keane, this is not the venue.

882
01:12:32,659 --> 01:12:35,374
Perhaps you would like to write a letter to the editor?

883
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:36,892
What are you afraid of?

884
01:12:37,536 --> 01:12:41,340
Just because people like my work, that means automatically it's bad?

885
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,007
No, but it doesn't make art either.

886
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:47,037
Art should elevate, not pander.

887
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,089
Particularly at the Hall of Education.

888
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:50,631
You have no idea!

889
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:54,412
Why does someone become a critic? because he can not creat.

890
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:57,302
Oh dear, that mouldy chastener.

891
01:12:57,437 --> 01:12:58,321
Don't interrupt!

892
01:12:58,456 --> 01:13:04,001
You don't know what's like to put your emotion out there, naked for the whole world to see!

893
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:07,414
What emotions? it's synthetic hack work.

894
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:10,397
Your "master piece" has infinite Keanes.

895
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:13,183
Which makes it infinite kitsch.

896
01:14:00,058 --> 01:14:03,012
What is wrong with the Lowest common denominator?

897
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:08,655
That's what this country was build of!

898
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:16,006
I'm gonna sue everybody.

899
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,623
I'm gonna sue everybody!

900
01:14:25,756 --> 01:14:31,605
I want to sue this pansy critic, sue the World's Fair.

901
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:47,143
I'm gonna take down Unicef, or his precous little box of dime.

902
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:01,292
But I can't sue you, can I?

903
01:15:03,127 --> 01:15:10,728
You're really ultimate betrayal, you fail me with that painting.

904
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:23,602
You cross over from sentimentality to kitsch.

905
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:26,602
Walter, stop it!

906
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:44,105
You like making me look bad, you enjoy people laughing at me?

907
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:50,216
Open it up, open it up! let me in!

908
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:10,113
I can see you!

909
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:24,265
I'm gonna burn you out!

910
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:30,788
You gonna blow up like atomic bomb!

911
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,617
Where are you?

912
01:16:59,693 --> 01:17:03,575
I am so sorry, I was not the mother I could've been.

913
01:17:05,274 --> 01:17:07,478
I should've done this years ago.

914
01:17:08,409 --> 01:17:11,006
Can't believe we're going, We don't have any clothes.

915
01:17:13,164 --> 01:17:15,225
Where we're going, we don't need much!

916
01:17:17,021 --> 01:17:18,644
Hawaii.

917
01:17:19,938 --> 01:17:20,801
Really?

918
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:24,550
Yes, Hawaii, because it's paradise there.

919
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:29,054
You know there're birds, flowers, beautiful colours.

920
01:17:30,886 --> 01:17:33,239
We gonna make a new life for ourselves.

921
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:37,835
That's my girl.

922
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:47,041
Honolulu, One year later.

923
01:18:31,762 --> 01:18:35,545
You're sure hard to track down, I thought I may never find you.

924
01:18:37,203 --> 01:18:38,548
Walter ...

925
01:18:39,098 --> 01:18:41,277
I was a little agitated.

926
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:45,190
I got this strangest paper in the mail today.

927
01:18:46,253 --> 01:18:49,949
It's a decreed legal seperation, I would appreciated it if you sign it.

928
01:18:51,236 --> 01:18:53,579
Aren't you acting a little rush?

929
01:18:54,366 --> 01:18:56,356
Walter, I want a divorce.

930
01:18:57,969 --> 01:19:01,642
Hurts to hear you say these words, that's sure how we come to this.

931
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:07,493
I suppose I could agree just split as long as...

932
01:19:08,423 --> 01:19:12,276
... as you sign me all rest of every painting you ever produce.

933
01:19:15,773 --> 01:19:17,461
If that's the price.

934
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:19,055
Really?

935
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:26,073
Ok, well, then we have to consider future revenue strings ...

936
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,255
My God, Walter! how much more money do you need?

937
01:19:28,528 --> 01:19:31,822
If you want me out of your life, here is my bargain.

938
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:34,411
You have to paint me a hundred more waifs ...

939
01:19:34,578 --> 01:19:36,990
... a hundred more Walter Keanes.

940
01:19:42,134 --> 01:19:46,251
Jane, I'm gonna go to post stop, you wanna come?

941
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,879
No, I'm gonna go surf's game.

942
01:19:48,978 --> 01:19:51,804
- Jane, I think your friends are a little wild.
- Who's not, mom?

943
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:53,729
You're impossible.

944
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,080
You move all the way ...

945
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:59,102
... to Hawaii, and I actually make some friends, all you do is complain about them.

946
01:20:00,289 --> 01:20:02,115
Maybe you need to make some.

947
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,545
You know that I can not have people over to the house.

948
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:09,276
That's right, or else they would see the precious paintings.

949
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,751
Hello, we visit everyone in this neighbourhood with an important message.

950
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:56,309
We have something to share with you ..

951
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,810
... about the wonderful things the God's kindom  ...

952
01:20:58,911 --> 01:21:00,111
... would do for mankind.

953
01:21:00,825 --> 01:21:03,121
Well from where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere ...

954
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:06,722
... just a lot of pride deviant people treating each other poorly.

955
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:09,722
Do you know what it says in Timothy 3: 1-5?

956
01:21:10,644 --> 01:21:15,128
In the last days, critical time hard to dealt with will be here ...

957
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:18,324
... for men would be lovers of themselves.

958
01:21:18,645 --> 01:21:20,308
Sounds like my ex-husband.

959
01:21:30,648 --> 01:21:32,015
Would you like to come in?

960
01:21:37,452 --> 01:21:42,920
It says right here, "a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things".

961
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:47,396
I just can't believe you let people in the house.

962
01:21:48,005 --> 01:21:54,941
It also says, "No lies speak the truth, let stealer steal no more."

963
01:22:00,627 --> 01:22:06,042
Shit, this is crazy man! all these copies! you're like Worhol!

964
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:08,341
Worhol like me.

965
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:11,060
That fruit fly stole my art.

966
01:22:12,959 --> 01:22:14,896
My art supplies!

967
01:22:16,076 --> 01:22:16,856
I had a factory ...

968
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,357
... even before what soup can was!

969
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:37,455
Oh yeah, we got a special guest today.

970
01:22:37,756 --> 01:22:38,956
A  world famous celebrity.

971
01:22:39,141 --> 01:22:41,849
So let's give a big 'Aloha' to Margaret Keane.

972
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:48,765
So, is it true you husband Walter is the top selling painter in the world?

973
01:22:53,087 --> 01:22:57,839
No, big Lolo, everything you just said is false.

974
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:03,026
One, Walter and I are no longer married.

975
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:08,408
And two, he is not a painter.

976
01:23:12,858 --> 01:23:16,542
But did I mistake, is he the guy does the 'crazy eyes'?

977
01:23:17,967 --> 01:23:19,153
No.

978
01:23:19,962 --> 01:23:23,842
Although he's been taking credit for 10 years.

979
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:29,375
I am the only painter in family.

980
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,083
You got to be kidding!

981
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:11,841
<I> You know what piss me off? </ i>

982
01:24:12,153 --> 01:24:15,614
<I> Margaret give the scoop to some button pusing Big Lolo. </ I>

983
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,753
<I> Instead of some respectful jounalist like myself. </ I>

984
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,533
I knew it.

985
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:29,804
Who were the waif craft?

986
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,550
Margaret gone berserk, you got to help me.

987
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,703
I need a story, wire story, national, just to calm things down.

988
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:50,511
I don't know, Walter. which she said is pretty inflammatory.

989
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:53,507
This is nuts, doesn't even make sense!

990
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:58,835
When I studied art at Beaux Arts at the Paris,  she was still a little kid in Tennessee!

991
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:01,064
Look.

992
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,665
My very sketches.

993
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:10,414
Berlin orphans, 1949.

994
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,917
Why would Margaret do something like that?

995
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:18,164
She's unhinge. she left me to move into the jungle.

996
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:20,169
Fell in with religious zealous.

997
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:25,070
Jehovah's witness.

998
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:28,316
I really don't know all that much about that.

999
01:25:28,576 --> 01:25:31,313
They don't celebrate Christmas, can't salute to flag.

1000
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:33,813
They won't even let Jane go to the prom.

1001
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:39,043
He makes me sound crazy.

1002
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:42,391
He said I copy him, he taught me how to paint.

1003
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,325
"She use a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors"

1004
01:25:47,172 --> 01:25:48,776
Which part of that isn't true?

1005
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:50,314
All of  it!

1006
01:25:50,848 --> 01:25:54,628
I feel good about myself for the first time in years, I can't let Walter ...

1007
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:56,419
... just take that away from me.

1008
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:00,092
Is Jehovah ok with suing?

1009
01:26:04,154 --> 01:26:06,256
U.S. Federal District Court Honolulu
Reporter: $ 17.000.000.

1010
01:26:06,533 --> 01:26:08,233
The art world is a buzz.

1011
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:11,313
Today at federal court, lawyers will present their opening argument ...

1012
01:26:11,414 --> 01:26:14,514
... indicate Magaret Keane vs. Walter Keane and Gkanet newspaper ...

1013
01:26:14,715 --> 01:26:19,115
... a trial could produce largest libel and slander reward in Hawaii histories.

1014
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,205
Step aside, please.

1015
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,294
Mr. Keane, are you at all concerns about the charges?

1016
01:26:36,804 --> 01:26:41,255
I am angry as hell, but I'm lucky I have the mighty Gkanet news company watching my back.

1017
01:26:41,422 --> 01:26:43,693
I expect this whole trial dismissed by noon.

1018
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:48,590
My only concern is somebody give this women some psychiatric help, she needs it.

1019
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:50,817
All right, excuse me, gentle man, excuse me.

1020
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:57,078
Margaret Keane is a public figure ...

1021
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:00,078
... and such him has approve that our newspaper's public statements  ...

1022
01:27:00,162 --> 01:27:02,451
... aware of probable falsity.

1023
01:27:02,663 --> 01:27:06,697
Now there is not evidence to suggest our editors could've known these assertion were untrue.

1024
01:27:07,214 --> 01:27:12,566
We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. Keane ...

1025
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:17,479
... credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so call "Big Eyes Children".

1026
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:29,860
How many years back these go?

1027
01:27:30,748 --> 01:27:33,228
Mrs. Keane has been making these statement since 1958.

1028
01:27:35,197 --> 01:27:37,678
This is very strange case.

1029
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:42,968
These paintings hanging museums all over the world all tribute to Mr. Keane.

1030
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:49,078
And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the comfusion.

1031
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:55,048
It seems impossible to connect such action would ever meet the standard of libel..

1032
01:27:55,697 --> 01:27:57,911
So the charge againts them is dismissed.

1033
01:27:58,146 --> 01:27:59,583
Thank you, Your Honor.

1034
01:28:03,096 --> 01:28:04,521
Good luck, Keane.

1035
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,082
Good luck? where're you going?

1036
01:28:07,426 --> 01:28:10,364
We're charged with libel, you're charged with slander.

1037
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:21,458
Mr. Keane?

1038
01:28:22,274 --> 01:28:24,471
You appear to be without consult.

1039
01:28:24,574 --> 01:28:27,594
Would you like to post permit in order to get your fair and orders?

1040
01:28:29,866 --> 01:28:32,784
I've always taken care of myself, I don't need a bunch of rented suits ...

1041
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:34,791
... to defend my good name.

1042
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:36,274
Let's proceed.

1043
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:44,274
AP -- HNOLULU -- KEANE TRIAL TAKES STARTLING TURN

1044
01:28:46,574 --> 01:28:48,874
UPI -- HONOLULU -- HE'S A PAINTER AND A LAWYER?

1045
01:28:49,676 --> 01:28:52,679
<I> I concern about my old pal Walter Keane. </ I>

1046
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:55,279
<I> The Hawaii heat may cook his brain. </ I>

1047
01:28:55,535 --> 01:29:00,798
<I> The only thing he knows about court room and laws come from watching Perry Mason on televison. </ I>

1048
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:04,985
I am the sole creator of my art.

1049
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:10,935
This is my entire life, my contribution to the world.

1050
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:15,361
Mr. Keane, I told you, you must ask witness questions.

1051
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:18,966
If you acting as your own attorney, you can not make statement this time.

1052
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:20,968
Alright.

1053
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:24,216
It's hard to keep all these things straight.

1054
01:29:25,844 --> 01:29:31,173
Mrs. Keane, how did you expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story?

1055
01:29:31,677 --> 01:29:33,064
Mr. Keane!

1056
01:29:39,093 --> 01:29:46,081
Mrs. Keane, you seems to be lucid, reasonablely intelligent woman.

1057
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:52,159
So how could you possibly have gone along with far-out statement like that?

1058
01:29:55,048 --> 01:29:57,177
I feel forced into it.

1059
01:29:58,478 --> 01:29:59,878
You have me ...

1060
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:05,049
He had me dominated.

1061
01:30:06,394 --> 01:30:09,762
He would rant and rave if I don't give he what he wanted.

1062
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:13,831
I was afraid, and I didn't see any options, so I went along.

1063
01:30:14,063 --> 01:30:16,163
May I remind you that you're under the oath?

1064
01:30:19,756 --> 01:30:26,569
I just give in, I allow him to take credit for the "Big Eyes".

1065
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:31,683
They were the reflection of my feelings, and  it was like losing a child.

1066
01:30:33,152 --> 01:30:34,830
But I was weak.

1067
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:40,432
I didn't think I can live and surpport myself and my daughter.

1068
01:30:41,075 --> 01:30:45,266
And he said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality.

1069
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:49,385
Maybe he was right.

1070
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:59,513
You were very talented been charming, and you're a genius at sale and promotion.

1071
01:31:02,234 --> 01:31:05,964
It sounds like you're describing two different man.

1072
01:31:07,036 --> 01:31:12,698
One a sadistic ogre, the other one a delightful bon vivant.

1073
01:31:13,483 --> 01:31:16,684
That's you, Walter, you're Jekyll and Hyde.

1074
01:31:17,432 --> 01:31:20,767
That's outrageous statement! I demand we strike it out from the record.

1075
01:31:21,014 --> 01:31:21,986
Overrule!

1076
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:27,058
You were outrageous, constantly criticise me, wore me down ...

1077
01:31:27,229 --> 01:31:30,309
... saying you would have me knocked off if I told the truth.

1078
01:31:30,621 --> 01:31:32,138
Well, I'm telling the truth.

1079
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:33,684
Your Honor!

1080
01:31:33,965 --> 01:31:35,369
I asks for mistrial.

1081
01:31:35,404 --> 01:31:38,527
You're a liar, you don't even know what the truth is!

1082
01:31:38,811 --> 01:31:41,212
You don't even know, but I'm stating the truth now.

1083
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:43,012
You can not shut me up!

1084
01:31:44,925 --> 01:31:48,094
This is not a domestic squabble, or maybe it is.

1085
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:51,613
But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it.

1086
01:31:55,988 --> 01:31:58,292
I'm sorry for my emotion.

1087
01:32:00,388 --> 01:32:02,077
I'm a artist.

1088
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:05,203
Maybe.

1089
01:32:06,441 --> 01:32:07,712
Your Honor!

1090
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:13,251
I call as my witness, Mr. Walter Stanley Keane!

1091
01:32:20,106 --> 01:32:24,427
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1092
01:32:24,662 --> 01:32:26,035
Yes.

1093
01:32:33,785 --> 01:32:42,569
Mr. Keane, there seems a lot of in your window and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "Big Eye Waifs"

1094
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:48,962
Would you mind clarify to this court who spawn these paintings?

1095
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:57,146
Why, I created these children.

1096
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,180
Choreography is not necessary, Just sit down and testify.

1097
01:33:13,058 --> 01:33:15,000
I had a wonderful life.

1098
01:33:15,901 --> 01:33:20,901
I was a artist, and friend of untold celebrities.

1099
01:33:21,002 --> 01:33:23,802
Yeah, when I look back at all ...

1100
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:27,034
... to define what really mattered ...

1101
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:32,135
... it was that I was dedicated to hungry children of the world.

1102
01:33:34,638 --> 01:33:39,558
It all began in Berlin, after World War II ...

1103
01:33:40,233 --> 01:33:47,795
The orphans clutching part of wire, their bodies lacerated ...

1104
01:33:49,021 --> 01:33:52,748
... their fingers scrawny ... their eyes big.

1105
01:33:55,217 --> 01:33:57,249
Mrs. Joan Crawford walked out ...

1106
01:33:57,384 --> 01:33:59,810
Mr. Keane, sit down.

1107
01:34:00,438 --> 01:34:01,729
Marilyn Monroe ...

1108
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:03,530
the Newton and I ...

1109
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:08,431
Jerry Lewis calls me says I wants you to paint me and my family in clown suits.

1110
01:34:08,808 --> 01:34:12,838
Mrs. Natalie Wood walked out to me and said ...

1111
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:19,639
"This is the greatest single painting I've ever seen in my entire life!"

1112
01:34:19,748 --> 01:34:20,730
You done!

1113
01:34:21,016 --> 01:34:22,866
- I'm not finished.
- Actually you are!

1114
01:34:23,251 --> 01:34:26,099
I can not stand one more wire or shaggy dog tale.

1115
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,199
You're not testify, you filibuster it.

1116
01:34:28,322 --> 01:34:32,148
Federal court overburden enough without you ducky clacking nonsense.

1117
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:35,236
We can stay here until we grow old and die ...

1118
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:38,057
... but it's obvious this case boils down to your words ...

1119
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:39,658
... versus Mrs. Keane's words.

1120
01:34:39,858 --> 01:34:40,458
Mistrial.

1121
01:34:40,685 --> 01:34:42,554
No, it's not a mistrial!

1122
01:34:43,874 --> 01:34:47,675
In my opinion, there is only one way to clear this thing up.

1123
01:34:49,783 --> 01:34:51,898
You're both going to paint!

1124
01:34:54,685 --> 01:34:58,018
All right, bring those easels down, set them up on both side of the bench.

1125
01:35:11,189 --> 01:35:13,268
Now I'm not looking for a master piece.

1126
01:35:13,468 --> 01:35:16,768
I'm don't know much about these things, I'm a amateur, not art critic.

1127
01:35:17,055 --> 01:35:19,084
But is one hour enough?

1128
01:35:19,877 --> 01:35:21,295
Yes, Your Honor.

1129
01:35:24,533 --> 01:35:25,479
Ok, then.

1130
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:29,041
You both been provided with identical supplies.

1131
01:35:29,294 --> 01:35:33,544
So, without any further business, Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane. the court is yours.

1132
01:36:41,047 --> 01:36:42,627
Mr. Keane?

1133
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,146
Just setting them.

1134
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:51,463
Waiting for the muse to strike.

1135
01:36:52,737 --> 01:36:55,660
Well, your muse has 58 minutes.

1136
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,310
Mr. Keane, are you alright?

1137
01:37:30,436 --> 01:37:35,967
My old shoulder injury just flare up a bad muscle.

1138
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:40,293
I've been taking medicationg for inflammation ...

1139
01:37:56,849 --> 01:37:58,919
I don't think I will be able to paint today.

1140
01:38:17,243 --> 01:38:20,079
The jury found a favour with Margaret Keane on all points.

1141
01:38:20,179 --> 01:38:24,979
She went on charges of defamation, emotional destress, and damaged reputation.

1142
01:38:25,579 --> 01:38:27,579
Congratulation... Margaret ...

1143
01:38:27,879 --> 01:38:29,479
Thank you, thank you very much.

1144
01:38:30,705 --> 01:38:32,838
Margaret, what do you going to call the painting?

1145
01:38:34,346 --> 01:38:36,783
exhibit 224.

1146
01:38:39,097 --> 01:38:41,362
Margaret, can I possibly have your autograph?

1147
01:38:43,242 --> 01:38:44,921
<I> Two things matter to Margaret. </ I>

1148
01:38:45,122 --> 01:38:46,822
<I> Her daughter and her paintings. </ I>

1149
01:38:47,301 --> 01:38:49,719
<I> And after all the crazy turn the story took ... </ i>

1150
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:52,566
<I> ... she came out the end with bountiful. </ I>

1151
01:39:01,959 --> 01:39:05,178
Walter never accepted defeat.

1152
01:39:05,743 --> 01:39:08,753
Insisting he was the true artist for the rest of his life.

1153
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:10,991
He died in 2000, bitter and penniless.

1154
01:39:11,414 --> 01:39:13,806
He never produced another painting.

1155
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:17,492
Margaret found personal happiness and remarried.

1156
01:39:18,054 --> 01:39:21,958
After many years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Franciso.

1157
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:24,399
And opened a new gallery.

1158
01:39:25,225 --> 01:39:28,913
She still paints everyday.
