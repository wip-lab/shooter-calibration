00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,960
纯粹意志所驱使的人
sheer will.

165
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,990
是你所不了解的
Something you know very little about.

166
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,630
我曾亲眼看到他在酒吧用铅笔杀了3个人
I once saw him kill three men in a bar.

167
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,930
用一支铅笔
With a pencil.

168
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,770
就用他妈一支
With a fuckin'...

169
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,170
铅笔
...pencil.

170
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,250
突然有一天他说要金盆洗手了
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

171
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,890
当然是为了一个女人
It's over a woman, of course.

172
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,730
所以我和他做了笔交易
So I made a deal with him.

173
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,840
我给了他一个不可能完成的任务
I gave him an impossible task.

174
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,210
一个无人能完成的任务
A job no one could have pulled off.

175
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,220
他那天所埋下的尸体
The bodies he buried that day

176
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,250
成就了我们的今天
laid the foundation of what we are now.

177
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
那么 我的儿子
And then, my son,

178
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,230
就在他妻子死了的几天后
a few days after his wife died,

179
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,970
你却偷了他的车
you steal his car

180
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,700
还杀了他的狗
and kill his fuckin' dog.

181
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,750
父亲 我可以搞定这件事
Father, I can make this right.

182
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,110
哦
Oh...

183
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,080
你想怎么做
How do you plan that?

184
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,140
搞定由我所挑起的事
By finishing what I started.

185
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,110
他有听到我说的话了吗
What the... Did he hear a fucking word I said?

186
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
Iosef! Iosef! 听着
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

187
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,290
什么
Huh?

188
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,220
John会过来找你寻仇
John will come for you.

189
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,000
而你什么都做不了
And you will do nothing,

190
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,070
因为你本就一事无成
because you can do nothing.

191
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,600
滚出我的视线
So get the fuck out of my sight!

192
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,130
你好 John
Hello, John.

193
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,840
我听说了你妻子的事了 我很抱歉
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

194
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,960
节哀顺变
My condolences.

195
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,210
这似乎是命运 或是偶然
It seems to be fate, or happenstance

196
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,980
或只是纯粹运气不好让我们又相遇了
or just bad fuckin' luck caused our paths to cross once again.

197
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,960
John
John

198
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,930
我们不要被自己不好的天性所驱使
Let us not resort to our baser instincts

199
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,930
让我们像文明人一样来解决这件事
and handle this like civilized men, to move on...

200
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,980
他说了什么
What'd he say?

201
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,050
够了
Enough.

202
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,150
天啊
Oh, God.

203
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,940
准备好人手
Task your crew.

204
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,190
多少人
How many?

205
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,660
你有多少人
How many do you have?

206
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:16,500
快快睡觉 夜魔人要来找你了

207
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,110
他从沼泽而来

208
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,210
收拾不听话的孩子

209
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,500
夜魔

210
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,310
晚上好 John

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,450
晚上好 Jimmy

212
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,920
有邻居抱怨噪音

213
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,550
是的 是噪音
Noise complaint.

214
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,130
你又重新工作了
You, uh, workin' again?

215
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,100
没有 只是理清点事情
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

216
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,940
啊 好吧
Ah, well...

217
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,210
那就这样吧
I'll leave you be, then.

218
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,350
晚安 John
Good night, John.

219
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,550
晚安 Jimmy

是的 John Wick
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

222
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,970
我想预定个12人份的晚餐
I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12.

223

你气色不错啊
You look good.

226
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,510
我就怕你早就不干这些了
And here I'd feared you'd left all this behind.

227
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,460
我以后还能再接到你电话吗
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

228
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,030
再见 Carlie
Goodbye, Charlie.

229
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,760
John
John

230
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,770
肯定是他干的

两百万
Two million.

234
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,200
舍不得孩子套不着狼

235
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,520
请说英语 Viggo
English, Viggo, please.

236
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,260
把Iosef放在红圈里 然后我们守株待兔
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

237
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,660

238
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,830

我有个工作给你做
I have a job for you.

242
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,570
你怎么不在电话里说
And I've got a phone.

我想要当面给你
I want to offer you this face to face

245
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,410
鉴于你可能觉得这有点私人
seeing as how you might find it personal.

246
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,280
你会为了两百万杀了John Wick吗
Would you kill John Wick for two million dollars?

247
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,590
毕竟 你是他最亲密的人
After all, you were close.

248
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,360
这悬赏只面向我一人吗
Is the contract exclusive?

249
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,160
不 面向所有人
No, it's open.

250
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,330
这是紧急问题 得马上解决
It's a timely matter, it has to be handled quickly.

00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,680
当然 先生
Of course, sir.

261
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,620
这里什么时候装修过了
So when did the old place get a facelift?

262
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,690
大概在4年前
Around four years ago.

263
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,690
我保证你 先生 这里没多大变化
But I assure you, sir, she really hasn't changed much.

264
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,890
还是同一个主人

265
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,460

你好 Winston
Hello, Winston.

273
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,500
Jonathan
Jonathan.

274
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,870
据我回忆
Now, as I recall,

275
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,940
你是不是就是那个
weren't you the one tasked to dole out

276
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,040
打架从来不挨揍的人?
the beatings, not receive them?

277
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,540
生疏了 我想
Rusty, I guess.

278
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,250
您有何贵干
To what do we owe the pleasure?

279
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,850
Iosef Tarasov.
Iosef Tarasov.

280
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,520
他怎么了
What about him?

281
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,760
我想和他谈谈
I'd like to talk with him.

282
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,720
谈谈 哈
A talk, you say.

283
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,800
我对你这种说辞很熟悉, Johnathon
I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan.

284
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,270
我想要问问你
I want to ask you this.

285
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,130
你有真正退休过吗
Have you returned to the fold?

286
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,900
只是拜访下
Just visiting.

287
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,010
那你有想过吗
Have you thought this through?

288
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,810
彻头彻尾的
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

289
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,710
你已经收手不干了一次
You got out once.

290
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,220
但你如果再跟这里扯上一丁点关系
You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond,

291
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,560
你就会发现有东西伸出来
you may well find something reaches out

292
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,920
又把你拽到深处
and drags you back into its depths.

293
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,190
我到哪儿去找他?
Where can I find him?

294
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,100
嘿.
Hey.

295
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,730
Wick在洲际酒店里.

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,100
欢迎回家 John

297
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,470
我们有人愿意帮我们摆平他
We have a contact there who's willing to take him out for us.

298
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,670
怎么样?
Yeah?

299
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,540
真无耻.
How Bracen.

300
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,650
如果他们敢于破坏酒店的规矩
If they're willing to break the rules of Continental,

301
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,220
双倍悬赏金
double the bounty.

302
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,750
你知道这儿的规矩的
You know the rules.

303
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,860
别在酒店的地盘上接活办事
No business can be conducted on these premises

304
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,290
以免遭受严重惩罚
Lest incurring heavy penalties

305
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,960
先喝一杯
Have a drink

306
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,670
然后放松
and relax.

307
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,100
现在
For now.

308
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,910
这是私事
It's personal.

309
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,820
我的天啊! Jonathan!
Holy shit! Jonathan!

310
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,090
嘿, Addy. 我的天啊
Hey, Addy. My God!

311
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,960
多久没见面了四年
How long has it been? Four years?

312
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,590
五年多吧
Five and change.

313
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,030
告诉我，退休的生活怎么样
So tell me, how was life on the other side?

314
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,030
很好，Addy
It was good, Addy.

315
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,870
比我应得的生活好多了
Far better than I deserved.

316
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,970
嘿 我很抱歉关于你
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...

317
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,070
谢谢
Thanks.

318
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,970
我从来没见过你像这样
I've never seen you like this.

319
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,040
像怎么样
Like what?

320
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,650
憔悴
Vulnerable.

321
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,720
我退休了
I'm retired.

322
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,650
只要你在这喝酒 就代表着你没有
Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.

323
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,250
老样子
Usual? Please.

324
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,100
酒店请客

00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,630
谢谢

492
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,720
你结婚了 稳定下来的
Then you got married, ah? Settled down.

493
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,440
你是怎么做到的
How did you manage that anyways?

494
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,830
运气
Luck, I guess.

495
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,300

496
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,330
是的 你有你的妻子 我有我的儿子

相信我 你本有个更好的活可做

498

但你却洗手不干了
And then you left.

499
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,810
你退出的样子
And the way you got out,

500
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:46,280
自欺欺人说过去不会影响将来
lying to yourself that the past held no sway over the future.

501
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,880
但是到最后
But in the end,

502
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:54,520
我们还是要为我们的恶行做出代价
a lot of us are rewarded for our misdeeds,

503
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,260
这就是为什么上帝带走了你的妻子

504
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:02,270
然后你摊上了我
and unleashed you upon me.

505
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,370
这种命运会紧紧跟着你
This life follows you.

506
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:13,280
纠缠着你
It clings to you,

507
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,620
感染每一个与你亲近的人
infecting everyone who comes close to you.

508
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,420
你和我 都被诅咒了
We are cursed, you and I.

509
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,920
这个我同意
On that we agree.

510
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,930
终于达成了共识
Finally, common ground.

511
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,600
好吧
Okay.

512
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,870
站一边去
Step aside.

513
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,800
交出你的儿子

514
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,440

夜魔
Baba Yaga

516
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,450
那只是部车 一条狗

517
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,880
只是条狗
Just a dog...

518
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,410
Viggo?
Viggo?

519
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

520
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,720
Helen死了后，我失去了一切
When Helen died, I lost everything.

521
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:05,400
直到那条狗到了我的门前
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.

522
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,630
一个来自我妻子最后的礼物
A final gift from my wife.

523
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,800
那一刻 我看到了希望

524
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,870
一个不在独自一人痛苦的机会

525
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,580
但是 你的儿子

526

夺走了它

527
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,550

从我身边偷走了它
Stole that from me!

529
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,550
从我面前杀了它
Killed that from me!

530
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,290
人们一直在问我是不是重操旧业了
People keep asking if I'm back.

531
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,890
但我不知如何回答
And I haven't really had an answer.

532
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:38,600
但是现在 我觉得 我回来了
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

533
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,700
所以 你要么交出你的儿子

534
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,370
要么就在他旁边尖叫着死去
