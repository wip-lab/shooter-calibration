90
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,802
- She's asleep.
- She was in hysterics 3 minutes ago.

91
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:36,607
- Are you asleep, ma'am?

00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:41,384

93
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:46,156
l'm very ashamed, Doctor.
Suddenly l was crying.

94
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,133
To cry is perfectly normal.

99
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,652
There she goes again.
Give her something, please.

100
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,852
Uncover her arm, please.

101
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,270
- What's that?
- Sleep and calm.

102
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,138
This will relax you
and make you feel a little happy.

103
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,143
lt's a new drug, quite harmless.

104

There.

105
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,857

You will. lt may take
a little time to take hold.

107
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,535
Just now, lie back.

108
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:40,534
- Can l keep just one light on?
- Of course.

109
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:46,516
The best thing l know is to do
exactly what you wish for a while.

110
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,417
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,293
Oh, the General! Doctor, quick.

112
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,065

113
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,869

114
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:08,212

123
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:47,993
A nervous straight.
Come home, you fools.

124
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:53,432
Look at that, 6,500.
Not bad, that's ten bucks.

125
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,436
One more round and l'm gonna throw

00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:10,585
What do you mean early?
My personal invitation says 1 1 .45.

129
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,427
Could it be because you're ahead?

130
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,762
- lt could.
- Works out fine for me.

131
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:20,967
This is my last 5,000 and
you hyenas are not gonna get it.

You may sit down.

143
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,968
You'd better sit up, or you'll
get picked up by the police.

144
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,638

You know, people who can't
handle liquor shouldn't drink it.

148
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:41,562
''lf l were dead and buried
and l heard your voice,''

149
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:47,901
''beneath the sod my heart of dust
would still rejoice.''

150
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,037

snoozing away in a public street.
Would you care to make a statement?

154
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,333
What the world needs

155
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:13,501
is a return to sweetness and decency
in the souls of its young men and...

156
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:24,423
Yeah, l couldn't agree
with you more, but...

157
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:38,914
Get yourself some coffee,
you'll be all right.

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,481
All right. l'll drop you off, come on.

163
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:28,682
- lt's a taxi!

00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:41,638
- Colosseum.

00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:02,233
Where do you want to go?
Where shall l take you?

171
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,076
Where do you live?

172
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:10,150
Come on. Where do you live?

173
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:14,191
Come on, where do you live?

174
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,656
Colosseum.

175
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,969
- She lives in the Colosseum.
- lt's the wrong address.

176
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,079
Look, for me it is very late night.

177
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:32,745
My wife... l have three bambino,
you know bambino?

178
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:38,252
My taxi go home,
we go home together.

179
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,400
Via Margutta 51 .

180
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,900
Via Margutta 51 !

181
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:00,692
Here is Via Margutta 51 .
l am very happy.

182
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:04,629
A thousand lire. Mila lire.

183
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:19,589
One, two, three, four mila.

184
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:23,726
- OK.
- For me?

185
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:29,095
OK. Now, look,
take a little bit of that.

186
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,439
Take her wherever she wants to go.

187
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:39,281
Goodnight.

188
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:45,787
Oh! No, no. Momento.

189
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:51,405
All right. Look, when she wakes up,
she'll tell you where to go.

190
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:55,670
Momento.
My taxi is not for sleep.

191
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,712
You understand?

192
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,887
Look, pal, this is not my problem.

193
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,718
l never see her before. OK.

194
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,328
ls not your problem,
is not my problem.

195
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:13,302
What you want?
You don't want girl, me don't want girl.

196
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:15,805
Police. Maybe she want girl!

197
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,971
Stay calm, stay calm. OK.

198
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:03,139
So happy.

199
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,943
So happy.

200
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,451
l ought to have my head examined.

201
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:36,523
ls this the elevator?

202
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,330
lt's my room!

203
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:46,840
l'm terribly sorry to mention it,
but the dizziness is getting worse.

204
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:52,547
- Can l sleep here?
- That's the general idea.

205
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:57,627
Can l have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

206
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,198
l'm afraid
you'll have to rough it tonight.

207
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:05,304
- ln these.
- Pyjamas.

208
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:09,172
Sorry, honey, l haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

209
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:14,345
Will you help me
get undressed, please?

210
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:21,621
OK.

211
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:37,944
There you are.
You can handle the rest.

212
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,899
May l have some?

213
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,542
No!

214
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:58,508
- Now, look!
- This is very unusual.

215
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:03,956
l've never been alone with a man
before, even with my dress on.

216
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:08,032
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

217
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,267
l don't seem to mind. Do you?

218
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:21,176
l think l'll go out for a cup of coffee.
You'd better get to sleep.

219
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:24,283
Oh, no. On this one.

220
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:27,724
You're terribly nice.

221
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:29,729
Hey, come here.

222
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:35,368
These are pyjamas, they're
to sleep in. You're to climb into them.

223
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:37,101
- Understand?
- Thank you.

224
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:42,547
And you sleep on the couch. Not on
the bed, on the couch. ls that clear?

225
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:46,247
- Do you know my favourite poem?
- You've already recited it.

226
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:50,726
''Arethusa arose
From her couch of snows''

227
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:54,530
''ln the Acroceraunian Mountains.''

228
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,706
- Keats.
- Shelley.

229
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,970
Keep your mind off the poetry
and on the pyjamas.

230
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,171
- You'll be fine.
- Keats.

231
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,513
Shelley. l'll be back
in about ten minutes.

232
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:07,815
Keats.

233
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:18,899
You have my permission to withdraw.

234
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:20,837
Thank you very much.

235
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:30,249
- Well?
- No trace.

236
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,758
- Did you search the grounds?
- Attics to cellar.

237
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,558
You must swear not to
speak of this to anyone.

238
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:40,968
l must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

239
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:45,613
This must be classified as top
crisis secret. Have l your pledge?

240
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:48,306
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

241
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:53,617
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

242
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:19,351
- So happy.
- The pleasure's mine.

243
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,789
Screwball!

244
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:14,325
Holy smoke,
the princess's interview!

245
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:17,606
Eleven forty-five!

246
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,437
Oh, sh!

247
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:04,875
Hi, Joe.

248
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,743
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

249
00:32:11,457 --> 00:32:15,053
Mr Hennessy has been
looking for you.

250
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:16,786
Uh-oh.

251
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:20,131
Thanks a lot, hon.

252
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,793
Come in.

253
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:33,635
- Looking for me?
- Just coming to work?

254
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:37,572
- Who, me?
- We start at 8.30 in this office.

255
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,270
- We pick up our assignments...
- l got mine last night.

256
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:44,574
- What assignment was that?
- The princess, 1 1 .45.

257
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:50,344
You've already been to the interview?

258
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,079
Sure, l just got back.

259
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,418
- Well, well. All my apologies.
- lt's all right.

260
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,490
- lnteresting.
- No, just routine.

261
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:01,991
Did she answer
all the questions on the list?

262
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:05,857
Of course. l've got 'em
right here somewhere.

263
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:09,089
Don't disturb yourself,
l have a copy here.

264
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:13,758
How did Her Highness react to
the idea of a European Federation?

265
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:17,837
- She thought it was just fine.
- She did?

266
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:23,266
- She thought there'd be two effects.
- Two?

267
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:27,844
- The direct and the indirect.
- Remarkable.

268
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:33,607
Naturally, she thought that the indirect
would not be as direct as the direct.

269
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,012
- That is, not right away.
- No.

270
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,312
Later on, of course, nobody knows.

271
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,613
Well, well.

272
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,949
That was a shrewd observation.

273
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:51,584
They fool you, these royal kids.
They're smarter than we suspect.

274
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:57,459
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

275
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:02,726
Youth. She felt that
the youth of the world

276
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:07,065
must lead the way to a better world.

277
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:09,895
Original.

278
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,043
By the way, what was she wearing?

279
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,939
- You mean what did she have on?
- That's usually what it means.

280
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:23,479
- ls it too warm for you?
- No, l just hurried over here.

281
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:26,310
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

282
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,146
- Did you say she was wearing grey?
- No, l didn't.

283
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:35,346
- She usually wears grey.
- Well, it was a kind of a grey.

284
00:34:35,558 --> 00:34:38,491
l think l know the dress,
it has a gold collar...

285
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:42,024
That's the one. l didn't know
exactly how to describe it.

286
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:45,957
l think you described it very well,

287
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:50,328
in view of the fact that
she was taken violently ill at 3 a.m.,

288
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:52,524
put to bed with a high fever,

289
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:57,637
and has had all her appointments
for today cancelled in toto!

290
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,071
- ln toto?
- Yes, Mr Bradley, in toto.

291
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:10,779
- That's pretty hard to swallow.
- ln view of the fact you just left her.

292
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:14,971
Here it is, Mr Bradley, all over the
front page of every paper in Rome.

293
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:18,118
All right, l overslept.
lt can happen to anybody.

294
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,650
lf you ever got up
and read a morning paper,

295
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:24,948
you might discover little news events,
little items of general interest,

296
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:28,956
that might stop you getting
immersed in such a gold-plated,

297
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:32,754
triple-decked, star-spangled
lie as you have just told me.

298
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:36,556
lf l were you l'd try some other
business, like mattress testing!

299
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:40,131
- ls this the princess?
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

300
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:44,292
lt isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour
or Madame Chiang Kai-Shek.

301
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:47,869
Take a good look. You might
interview her again some day.

302
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:50,436
Am l fired?

303
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:55,007
No. When l want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

304
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:56,735
You'll know you're fired.

305
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:02,077
The man's mad.

306
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,988
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

307
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,790
Now listen carefully.

308
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:34,662
Hurry up to my place and see
if there's somebody there, asleep.

309
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,535
Aha. Si, Mr Joe.

310
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,070
l look, you wait.

311
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:05,984
- Mr Joe?
- Yeah. Tell me.

312
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,890
Giovanni, l love you! Now listen.

313
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:15,119
Yes, Mr Joe.

314
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:19,355
A gun? No.

315
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:22,501
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything.

316
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:26,659
But nobody goes in
and nobody goes out.

317
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,230
OK.

318
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,314
You still here?

319
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:46,813
What would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

320
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:51,249
- Are you referring to Her Highness?
- l'm not referring to Annie Oakley...

321
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:53,113
- How much?
- What do you care?

322
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:56,620
- You've got no chance...
- lf l did, how much?

323
00:37:56,824 --> 00:38:01,588
Just a plain talk on world
conditions might be worth 250.

324
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:04,261
Her views on clothes, a lot more.

325
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:05,951
- Maybe 1 ,000.
- Dollars?

326
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:10,257
l'm talking about
her views on everything.

327
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:14,833
The private and secret
longings of a princess.

328
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:18,664
Her innermost thoughts, as revealed
to your own correspondent,

329
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:25,708
in a private, personal,
exclusive interview.

330
00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:35,314
Can't use it, huh?
l didn't think you'd like it.

331
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:39,514
Come here.

332
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:45,280
- Love angle too, l suppose?
- Practically all love angle.

333
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,217
With pictures?

334
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,949
Could be. How much?

335
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,218
That particular story would be worth
five grand to any news service.

336
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:56,260
But tell me, Mr Bradley,
if you are sober,

337
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:59,522
how you are going to
obtain this fantastic interview.

338
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:03,132
l'll enter her sick room
disguised as a thermometer.

339
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:07,703
You said five grand?
l want you to shake on that.

340
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,968
You realise she's in bed
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

341
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:16,473
- Yes.
- l'd like to make a little side bet.

342
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:20,634
Five hundred says
you don't come up with the story.

343
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:31,477
- What are you looking at that for?
- Just want to see what day it is.

344
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:36,584
- lt's a deal.
- Now l'd like you to shake.

345
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,152
You're into me for about $500 now.

346
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:45,420
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me $1 ,000.

347
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:48,120
You poor sucker,
l'll practically own you.

348
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:52,164
You practically have for a couple
of years but that's all over.

349
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:57,167
l'm going to win that money and buy
a one-way ticket back to New York.

350
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,770
Go on, l love to hear you whine.

351
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:03,065
When l'm back in a real
newsroom, l'll think of you,

352
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:07,675
sitting here with an empty leash
and nobody to twitch for you.

353
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:11,040
So long, pigeon.

354
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,089
- Signor Bradley.
- Everything OK, Giovanni?

355
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:46,497
Si Signor Joe.
Nobody come, nobody go.

356
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:50,104
- Absolutely nobody.
- Swell, thanks a lot.

357
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:58,669
Oh... Giovanni...
How'd you like to make some money?

358
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,436
- Money?
- Yeah.

359
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:04,012
That's the stuff. l've got a sure thing.

360
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:08,173
- Double your money back in two days.
- Double my money?

361
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,875
l need a little investment
capital to swing the deal.

362
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:14,987
Now if you'll lend me a little cash...

363
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:22,987
You owe me two months rent

364
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:26,560
and you want me to lend you money?

365
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:29,422
No.

366
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:33,064
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

367
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:39,907
Your Highness...?

368
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:44,913
Your Royal Highness...?

369
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:49,617
Yes, what is it?

370
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:33,550
Dear Dr Bannochhoven...

371
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:37,221
Oh, sure, yes, well...

372
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:41,517
You're fine, much better.
ls there anything you want?

373
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:46,024
- So many things.
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.

374
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,287
Tell the good doctor everything.

375
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:52,298
l dreamt and l dreamt...

376
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:56,026
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

377
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:01,168
l dreamt l was asleep in the street,

378
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:07,832
and a young man came,
he was tall and strong.

379
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,876
He was so mean to me.

380
00:45:11,913 --> 00:45:14,072
He was?

381
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:22,546
lt was wonderful.

382
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,735
Good morning.

383
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:06,041
- Where's Dr Bannochhoven?
- l'm afraid l don't know him.

384
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,910
- Wasn't l talking to him just now?
- Afraid not.

385
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,645
Have l had an accident?

386
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:17,748
No.

387
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:22,087
Quite safe for me to sit up, huh?

388
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:24,489
Perfectly.

389
00:46:34,636 --> 00:46:36,159
Thank you.

390
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:47,832
Are these yours?

391
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:59,242
- Did you lose something?
- No.

392
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:06,319
Would you be so kind
as to tell me where l am?

393
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,684
This is what is laughingly
known as my apartment.

394
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:16,828
- Did you bring me here by force?
- No, no. Quite the contrary.

395
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:24,121
- Have l been here all night...alone?
- lf you don't count me, yes.

396
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:30,127
So l've spent the night here with you?

397
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:35,864
Well, l don't know that
l'd use those words exactly,

398
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:42,374
but from a certain angle, yes.

399
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,752
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

400
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:04,222
- And you are?
- Bradley, Joe Bradley.

401
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:08,260
- Delighted.
- You don't know how delighted l am.

402
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:11,989
- You may sit down.
- Thank you very much.

403
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:19,436
What's your name?

404
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:28,105
- You may call me Anya.
- Well thank you, Anya.

405
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:33,302
- Coffee?
- What time is it?

406
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:35,001
About one-thirty.

407
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:37,738
One-thirty! l must get dressed and go!

408
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,781
Why the hurry? There's lots of time.

409
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:44,545
No there isn't, and l've been
enough trouble as it is.

410
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:48,711
Trouble?
You're not what l'd call trouble.

411
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:55,023
- l'm not?
- l'll run a bath for you.

412
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,569
There you are.

413
00:49:56,503 --> 00:49:58,230
Here we go now.

414
00:50:00,638 --> 00:50:04,662
There you are, that does it. All right.

415
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,535
Give me a little slack, will you?

416
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:11,506
lrving! Why don't you answer?

417
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:14,941
lt's Joe. Can you
get here in five minutes?

418
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:18,378
No, l can't come now, Joe, l'm busy.

419
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,811
Oh, no.

420
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,746
Joe, l'm up to my ears in work.

421
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:28,444
Get into your next outfit.
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

422
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:31,123
l can't talk over the phone.

423
00:50:31,325 --> 00:50:33,723
This whole thing
might easily blow sky-high.

424
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:36,416
lt's front-page stuff,
that's all l can say.

425
00:50:36,629 --> 00:50:39,619
lt might be political or
a scandal, l don't know,

426
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,389
but it's a big story.
l need pictures.

427
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,192
But l can't come now, Joe, l'm busy.

428
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:49,800
And l'm meeting Francesca
at Rocca's in half an hour.

429
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:52,139
- Don't understand.
- Don't understand?

430
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,686
There you are.

431
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:20,893
l was looking at all the people.
lt must be fun to live in a place like this.

432
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:25,122
lt has its moments. l can give you
a commentary on each apartment.

433
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,198
l must go.

434
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:34,702
- l only waited to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? But we've only just met!

435
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:37,405
- How about breakfast?
- l haven't time.

436
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:42,500
lt must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

437
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:46,169
- lt is.
- l'll go with you.

438
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:49,075
That's all right, l can find the place.

439
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:54,713
Thank you for letting me
sleep in your bed.

440
00:52:55,622 --> 00:53:00,750
- That's all right. Think nothing of it.
- lt was very considerate of you.

441
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:03,720
You must've been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

442
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:06,519
No, l do it all the time.

443
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:14,360
- Goodbye, Mr Bradley.
- Goodbye.

444
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:19,992
Go right through there,
and down all the steps.

445
00:53:20,204 --> 00:53:21,692
Thank you.

446
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:56,121
- Well... Small world!
- Yeah.

447
00:53:56,328 --> 00:53:59,625
l almost forgot.
Can you lend me some money?

448
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,127
Oh, yeah.

449
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:05,423
That's right,
you didn't have any did you?

450
00:54:08,635 --> 00:54:10,863
How much was it you wanted?

451
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:14,368
l don't know. How much have you got?

452
00:54:14,574 --> 00:54:18,770
Suppose we just split this fifty-fifty.
Here's a thousand lire.

453
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:22,375
A thousand!
Can you really spare all that?

454
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:25,978
- lt's about a dollar and a half.
- Oh.

455
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:32,014
l'll arrange for it to be sent back to you.
What is your address?

456
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:33,844
Via Margutta 51 .

457
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:36,576
Via Margutta 51 .

458
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:38,380

Goodbye. Thank you.

460
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,734
Double my money, eh?
You tell me how?

461
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:01,563
- Tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.

462
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:40,835
What a wonderful hair you have.

463
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:43,475
- Just cut, thank you.
- Just cut?

464
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:49,077
- Well, then... Cut so?
- Higher.

465
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:52,478
- Higher? Here?
- More.

466
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:56,876
- Here!
- Even more.

467
00:57:58,455 --> 00:57:59,751
Where?

00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:15,291
- All off?
- All off.

471
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,430
Off!

472
00:58:27,742 --> 00:58:30,106
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

473
00:58:31,443 --> 00:58:32,739
Yes!

474
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:37,410
Off!

475
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:43,947
Off!

476
00:58:49,255 --> 00:58:50,551
Off!

477
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:03,260
Oh no, no.

478
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:06,157
Off!

479
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:28,744
That's a nice camera
you have there. Nice...

480
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:33,248
You don't mind if l borrow it?

481
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,885
- Miss Webber.
- Just for two minutes.

482
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:37,678
No.

483
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:40,878
Go, it's my camera.

484
00:59:49,268 --> 00:59:52,060
You musician, maybe?

485
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:54,853
You artist, huh?

486
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:56,685
Painter?

487
00:59:58,592 --> 01:00:01,554

488
01:00:01,756 --> 01:00:04,344
- Model, huh?
- Thank you.

489
01:00:05,953 --> 01:00:07,576
lt's perfect.

490
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:13,870
You're nice without long hair.
Now it's cool, huh? Cool.

491
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,167
lt's just what l wanted.

492
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:20,900
Now, why don't you
come dancing tonight with me?

493
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:23,365
You should see, it's so nice.

494
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:28,056
lt's on a boat, on the Tiber,
the river, by Sant'Angelo.

495
01:00:28,267 --> 01:00:32,990
Moonlight, music, romantic.
lt's very, very...

496
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:37,090
- Please, you come?
- l wish l could.

497
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:44,681
But your friends,
l don't think they'll recognise you.

498
01:00:44,886 --> 01:00:47,440
No, l don't think they will.

499
01:00:47,649 --> 01:00:50,168
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

500
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:58,338
After nine l'll be there, dancing on
the river. Remember Sant'Angelo.

501
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:03,991
All my friends... lf you come,
you will be most pretty of all girls.

502
01:01:07,766 --> 01:01:09,696
Thank you.

A thousand lire.

Look.

509
01:02:59,517 --> 01:03:00,983
l'm sorry.

510
01:03:34,446 --> 01:03:38,244
- Well, it's you!
- Yes, Mr Bradley.

511
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,541
Or is it?

512
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:44,780
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

513
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,385
So that was your
mysterious appointment.

514
01:03:51,593 --> 01:03:54,823
- l have a confession to make.
- A confession?

515
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:59,760
Yes, l ran away
last night...from school.

516
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:01,662
Why?

517
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:05,166
- Trouble with the teacher?
- No, nothing like that.

518
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,667
You wouldn't run away for nothing.

519
01:04:07,872 --> 01:04:10,203
lt was only meant to be
for a few hours.

520
01:04:10,408 --> 01:04:14,138
They gave me something
last night to make me sleep.

521
01:04:14,345 --> 01:04:15,811
Oh, l see.

522
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:23,478
- l'd better get a taxi and go back.
- Look, before you do,

523
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:26,619
why not take a little time for yourself?

524
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:29,078
Maybe another hour.

525
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:33,020
Live dangerously, take the whole day.

526
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:35,386
l could do some things
l've always wanted to.

527
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:36,892
Like what?

528
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:41,964
You can't imagine. l'd like to do
whatever l liked, the whole day long.

529
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:44,760
Like having your hair cut
and eating gelati?

530
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:48,426
Yes, and l'd like to
sit at a sidewalk café,

531
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,233
look in shop windows,
walk in the rain.

532
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:55,069
Have fun, and maybe
some excitement.

533
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:58,868
lt doesn't seem much to you,
does it?

534
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:00,910
lt's great.

535
01:05:01,117 --> 01:05:05,552
Tell you what. Why don't we
do all those things...together?

536
01:05:05,754 --> 01:05:09,586
- Don't you have to work?
- No. Today will be a holiday.

537
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,781
You don't want to do
a lot of silly things.

538
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,449
Don't l? First wish, one sidewalk café.

539
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,130
Coming right up.
l know just the place.

540
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:18,858
Coming right up.
l know just the place.

541
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,037
What will they say in school
about your hair?

542
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:34,607
They'll have a fit.

543
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,369
What would they say if they knew
l'd slept in your room?

544
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:42,775
Tell you what, you don't tell your folks
and l won't tell mine.

545
01:05:42,984 --> 01:05:44,280
lt's a pact.

546
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:49,749
- Now, what would you like to drink?
- Champagne, please.

547
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:56,286
Champagne?

548
01:05:56,494 --> 01:06:01,794
Well, champagne,
and cold coffee for me.

549
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:07,592
Must be quite a school,
champagne for lunch.

550
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:10,465
- Only on special occasions.
- For instance?

551
01:06:10,673 --> 01:06:12,833
The last time
was my father's anniversary.

552
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,269
- Wedding?
- No.

553
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:20,037
The fortieth anniversary
of...the day he got his job.

554
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:24,375
Forty years on the job.
What do you know about that?

555
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:26,950
What does he do?

556
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:30,712
Well, mostly you might
call it public relations.

557
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:32,980
Oh, well that's hard work.

558
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:35,591
- l wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

559
01:06:35,793 --> 01:06:37,885
l've heard him complain about it.

560
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,494
Why doesn't he quit?

561
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:44,325
People in that line of work
almost never do quit,

562
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,227
unless it's actually unhealthy
for them to continue.

563
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,427
Well, here's to his health then.

564
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,937
You know, that's what
everybody says.

565
01:06:58,512 --> 01:07:01,604
- lt's all right?
- Yes, thank you.

566
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:04,242
What is your work?

567
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:07,475
Oh, l'm in the selling game.

568
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:09,380
Really? How interesting.

569
01:07:09,588 --> 01:07:11,577
What do you sell?

570
01:07:13,924 --> 01:07:18,825
Fertiliser. Chemicals, stuff like that.

571
01:07:26,702 --> 01:07:31,536
- lrving! Am l glad to see you!
- Why, did you forget your wallet?

572
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:34,605
- Sit down.
- Aren't you going to introduce me?

573
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:39,437
Yes. This is a very good friend of
mine, lrving Radovich. Anya, lrving.

574
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,235
- Anya...?
- Smith.

575
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:44,745
- Oh. Hiya, Smitty.
- Charmed.

576
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:51,943
Hey, did anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

577
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:03,762
- Well, l guess l'll be going.
- No, don't do that, join us.

578
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:10,601
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

579
01:08:10,804 --> 01:08:14,739
Tell me Mr Radovich,
what is a ringer?

580
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,374
- Oh, waiter!
- lt's an American term.

581
01:08:18,577 --> 01:08:23,308
lt means anyone who has
a great deal of charm.

582
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:26,414
Oh, thank you.

583
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:27,913
You're welcome.

584
01:08:32,055 --> 01:08:33,521
Cousins.

585
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:37,622
Mr Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

586
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:40,693
- l'd like to have heard that.
- What do you do?

587
01:08:40,895 --> 01:08:44,294
l'm in the same racket as Joe,
only l'm a...

588
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:47,193
l'm awfully sorry, lrving.

589
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:49,890
- What are you...?
- l'm sorry.

590
01:08:50,102 --> 01:08:53,559
l can take a hint. l'll see you around.

591
01:08:53,772 --> 01:08:58,707
- But your drink's just here.
- Yeah, lrving, take it easy.

592
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:03,004
l'm sorry about that.
Sit down, that's a good fellow.

593
01:09:03,214 --> 01:09:05,408
That's the boy.

594
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:09,843
You're... You're twisting
my arm, you know.

595
01:09:10,053 --> 01:09:13,510
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

596
01:09:13,722 --> 01:09:16,519
- Spill? Who's been spilling?
- You.

597
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:18,657
- Me?
- Yeah.

598
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:22,760
Where did you find this loony?

599
01:09:25,098 --> 01:09:30,398
You're OK. Here's to you, huh?
Here's hoping for the best.

600
01:09:30,604 --> 01:09:34,800
lf it wasn't for that hair,
l'd swear that you...

601
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:39,839
Thanks.

602
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:43,340
You slipped, you almost hurt yourself.

603
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:46,673
- l slipped?
- Yes, you did.

604
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,872
- l didn't slip.
- A bad sprain...

605
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:53,020
- Never mind!
- You'd better get it fixed up.

606
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:57,087
- Would you excuse us?
- Of course, l'm so sorry.

607
01:09:57,292 --> 01:10:01,590
Joe, what are you trying to do?
Take your hands off me.

608
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:03,420
- Got your lighter?
- What?

609
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:05,756
- Have you?
- Yeah.

610
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:10,194
Listen, what would you do
for five grand?

611
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,301
- Five grand?
- Look...

612
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:17,735
She doesn't know who l am.
This is my story, l gotta protect it.

613
01:10:17,941 --> 01:10:19,840
She's really the...

614
01:10:20,043 --> 01:10:23,068
Your pictures
will make this twice as valuable.

615
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,305
- The princess goes slumming.
- You're in for 25%.

616
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:30,074
- Of 5,000?
- Minimum, Hennessy shook on it.

617
01:10:30,285 --> 01:10:33,344
- That's $1 ,500!
- lt's $1 ,250.

618
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:37,147
- Now you shake.
- OK, now lend me 30,000.

619
01:10:37,357 --> 01:10:40,382
That's $50! Are you gonna buy
the crown jewels?

620
01:10:40,593 --> 01:10:44,119
She's drinking champagne.
We gotta entertain her.

621
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:47,421
We can't go running around
with a hot princess!

622
01:10:47,632 --> 01:10:51,567
Do you want in
on this deal or don't you?

623
01:10:57,373 --> 01:11:01,865
- This l want back Saturday.
- OK. Now where's your lighter?

624
01:11:02,077 --> 01:11:03,373
Let's go to work.

625
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:13,846
- Better now?
- Huh?

626
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:16,248
- Your ear.
- My ear?

627
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:19,947
Oh, yeah, Joe fixed it.

628
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,685
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Yes, please.

629
01:11:23,895 --> 01:11:26,727
You won't believe it,
but it's my very first.

630
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,124
Your very first?

631
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:34,792
- No smoking in school?
- Your first cigarette.

632
01:11:40,709 --> 01:11:42,766
There, the gismo works.

633
01:11:43,944 --> 01:11:46,911
Well, what's the verdict, OK?

634
01:11:47,114 --> 01:11:50,513
- Nothing to it.
- That's right, nothing to it.

635
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:56,553
l'll stretch my legs a little.

636
01:11:56,755 --> 01:12:01,486
- l'll pick this one up, lrving.
- You can afford it.

637
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:06,085
What next?
Shall we make a little schedule?

638
01:12:06,297 --> 01:12:09,094
Oh, not that word, please.

639
01:12:09,299 --> 01:12:13,631
l didn't mean a work schedule...
a school schedule,

640
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:17,827
- l meant a fun schedule.
- Let's just go, huh?

641
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,132
How about you, lrving, are you ready?

642
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:24,336
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

643
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:30,278
Francesca. Oh, this is...

644
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:33,280
- Smitty.
- She's a grand girl, lrving.

645
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:35,918
Five grand.

646
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:39,282
- Joe.
- Where are you going now?

647
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:42,515
Honey, l gotta work.
l'll call you tonight.

648
01:13:22,787 --> 01:13:27,245
Look at those men! They were
supposed to be inconspicuous.

649
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,947
You asked for plain clothes.

650
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:21,611
Hey, stop, come back.

651
01:17:18,212 --> 01:17:19,379
l'm going straight from now on.

652
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,540
l'm going straight from now on.

653
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:23,806
News Service? What did he mean?

654
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:29,647
Oh, you say you're with the press
and you can get away with anything.

655
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:34,756
Going to church to get married
on a scooter! Joe's a wonderful liar.

656
01:17:42,933 --> 01:17:45,399
Congratulations!

657
01:17:58,012 --> 01:18:01,104
Don't look so worried,
l won't hold you to it.

658
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:03,077
Thank you very much.

659
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:05,511
Don't be too grateful.

660
01:18:05,718 --> 01:18:07,547
OK, l won't.

661
01:18:09,655 --> 01:18:12,282
l'm a good liar too, aren't l?

662
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:16,892
- The best l ever met.
- Thank you very much.

663
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:20,823
Say... Come with me.

664
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,701
The Mouth of Truth.

665
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,963
The legend is, if you're a liar
and you put your hand in there,

666
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:34,696
it'll be bitten off.

667
01:18:34,909 --> 01:18:40,277
- What a horrid idea.
- Let's see you do it.

668
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:06,892
Let's see you do it.

669
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:10,269
Sure.

670
01:19:29,153 --> 01:19:30,449
Hello!

671
01:19:30,654 --> 01:19:36,921
- You beast, you're all right!
- l'm sorry. lt was just a joke.

672
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:40,424
- You never hurt your hand.
- l'm sorry.

673
01:19:40,629 --> 01:19:42,323
- OK?
- Yes.

674
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,258
All right, let's go. Look out!

675
01:19:54,307 --> 01:19:56,330
l'll park at the corner.

676
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:21,457
What do they mean,
all these inscriptions?

677
01:20:21,662 --> 01:20:24,788
Each one represents a wish fulfilled.

678
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:27,966
lt started during the war, in an air raid.

679
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:31,624
A man with his four children
was caught in the street.

680
01:20:31,837 --> 01:20:35,965
He ran to that wall for shelter
and prayed.

681
01:20:36,174 --> 01:20:39,073
Bombs fell very close
but no one was hurt.

682
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:43,212
Later, he came back
and put up the first tablet.

683
01:20:43,414 --> 01:20:45,347
Now it's a sort of shrine.

684
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:47,014
People come,

685
01:20:47,216 --> 01:20:52,242
and when their wishes are granted,
they put up another plaque.

686
01:20:52,454 --> 01:20:54,114
Lovely story.

687
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:59,653
Read some of the inscriptions.

688
01:21:14,305 --> 01:21:18,001
Make a wish? Tell the doctor?

689
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:23,841
Anyway, the chances of it
being granted are very slight.

690
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,342
Well, what now?

691
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:32,008
- l've heard you can dance on a boat.
- You mean Sant'Angelo.

692
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,153
- Couldn't we go tonight?
- Why not?

693
01:21:34,354 --> 01:21:35,980
Anything you wish.

694
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:41,592
At midnight l'll turn into a pumpkin
and drive away in my glass slipper.

695
01:21:41,794 --> 01:21:44,193
That'll be the end of the fairytale.

696
01:21:44,397 --> 01:21:48,332
- l guess lrving has to go now.
- l do?

697
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:53,025
Yes, you know, that big business
development you have to attend to?

698
01:21:53,237 --> 01:21:55,830
- That development.
- Can't afford not to.

699
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:58,871
Yeah. See you later, Smitty.

700
01:21:59,075 --> 01:22:02,440
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

701
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,359
Hello.

702
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,021
Hello.

703
01:24:01,842 --> 01:24:06,709
Mr Bradley, if you don't mind my
saying so, l think you're a ringer.

704
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:11,245
A what? Oh, thanks very much.

705
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:16,714
You've spent the whole day doing
things l've always wanted to. Why?

706
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,148
lt seemed the thing to do.

707
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:23,450
l've never heard of anybody so kind.

708
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:25,626
lt wasn't any trouble.

709
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:28,694
Or so completely unselfish.

710
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:36,256
Let's have a drink at the bar.

711
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,772
There you are.

712
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:49,853
l look for you a long time.
l think maybe you not come.

713
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:54,868
- Off, all off!
- lt's nice without, isn't it? Cool.

714
01:24:55,074 --> 01:24:58,640
- Oh, very good.
- This is Mr Bradley.

715
01:24:58,851 --> 01:25:00,947
l Mario Delani.

716
01:25:01,157 --> 01:25:04,129
- Old friends?
- Yes, he cut my hair.

717
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,392
He invited me here tonight.

718
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,879
- What was your name?
- Mario Delani.

719
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:14,681
Mario Delani.
l'm very glad to know you.

720
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:17,021
Me too.

721
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:22,372
Oh, may l enjoy myself the pleasure?

722
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:24,775
- You mind?
- Go right ahead.

723
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:26,612
l thank you.

724
01:25:49,447 --> 01:25:52,887
- Did l miss anything?
- You're just in time.

725
01:25:53,088 --> 01:25:56,687
- Who's Smitty dancing with?
- Her barber.

726
01:25:56,899 --> 01:25:59,895
He cut her hair this afternoon,
made a date for tonight.

727
01:26:00,107 --> 01:26:01,700
The princess and the barber?

728
01:27:12,725 --> 01:27:15,697
- What is it?
- Momento.

729
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:45,434
August!

730
01:27:53,294 --> 01:27:54,923
Thank you.

731
01:27:59,075 --> 01:28:00,543
Bye.

732
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:14,776
Your Highness.

733
01:28:16,453 --> 01:28:20,258
Dance quietly towards the entrance.
A car is waiting.

734
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,330
- No.
- Your Highness!

735
01:28:22,535 --> 01:28:26,271
You've made a mistake. Let me go!

736
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,763
Will you let me go? Mr Bradley!
Let me go, will you! Mr Bradley!

737
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:50,669
Hit him again, Smitty!

738
01:29:59,339 --> 01:30:01,713
- Here are my car keys.
- Police!

739
01:30:01,908 --> 01:30:04,081
The other side of the bridge.

740
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:17,036
- All right?
- Fine, you?

741
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:19,263
Oh, fine.

742
01:31:24,364 --> 01:31:26,614
You were great back there.

743
01:31:26,827 --> 01:31:29,008
You weren't so bad yourself.

744
01:31:56,117 --> 01:31:57,446
l...

745
01:31:59,026 --> 01:32:02,325
l guess we'd better get out of here.

746
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,646
This is the American Hour,

747
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:26,971
continuing our programme
of musical selections.

748
01:32:52,728 --> 01:32:57,139
- Everything ruined?
- No. They'll be dry in a minute.

749
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:03,728
Suits you. You should
always wear my clothes.

750
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,152
Seems l do.

751
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:14,867
l thought a little wine might be good.

752
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:18,902
- Shall l cook something?
- No kitchen.

753
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:22,944
- l always eat out.
- Do you like that?

754
01:33:23,549 --> 01:33:26,279
Well, life isn't always what one likes.

755
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:32,384
- ls it?
- No, it isn't.

756
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:42,461
- Tired?
- A little.

757
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:45,437
- You've had quite a day.
- A wonderful day.

758
01:33:45,644 --> 01:33:50,672
This is the American Hour
with a special news bulletin.

759
01:33:50,883 --> 01:33:54,319
There is no further word
from the bedside of Princess Ann,

760
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:59,288
who was taken ill yesterday
on the last leg of her European tour.

761
01:33:59,494 --> 01:34:02,258
Rumours suggest
her condition may be serious,

762
01:34:02,464 --> 01:34:06,298
causing alarm and anxiety
among the people in her country.

763
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,299
- The news can wait.
- Yes.

764
01:34:12,509 --> 01:34:15,672
May l have a little more wine?

765
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,549
l'm sorry l couldn't
cook us some dinner.

766
01:34:21,754 --> 01:34:23,847
Did you learn how in school?

767
01:34:24,057 --> 01:34:27,151
l'm a good cook.
l could earn my living at it.

768
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:30,261
l can sew too, clean a house, iron.

769
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:32,728
l learned to do all those things,

770
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:37,268
l just haven't had the chance
to do it for anyone.

771
01:34:40,043 --> 01:34:47,143
Well, looks like l'll have to move
and get a place with a kitchen.

772
01:34:52,192 --> 01:34:53,658
Yes.

773
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:21,756
l shall have to go now.

774
01:35:37,447 --> 01:35:38,913
Anya...

775
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:44,686
...there's something l want to tell you.

776
01:35:48,828 --> 01:35:50,887
No, please.

777
01:35:51,498 --> 01:35:53,465
Nothing.

778
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:09,118
l must go and get dressed.

779
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,536
Stop at the next corner, please.

780
01:36:51,738 --> 01:36:53,034
OK.

781
01:37:10,162 --> 01:37:13,392
- Here?
- Yes.

782
01:37:22,811 --> 01:37:24,836
l have to leave you now.

783
01:37:31,355 --> 01:37:37,089
l'm going to that
corner there and turning.

784
01:37:37,295 --> 01:37:40,458
You stay in the car and drive away.

785
01:37:41,367 --> 01:37:44,359
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

786
01:37:45,839 --> 01:37:49,002
Just drive away and leave me.

787
01:37:50,711 --> 01:37:52,905
As l leave you.

788
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,582
All right.

789
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,994
l don't know how to say goodbye.

790
01:38:08,733 --> 01:38:11,257
l can't think of any words.

791
01:38:13,606 --> 01:38:16,074
Don't try.

792
01:40:08,114 --> 01:40:10,139
Your Royal Highness,

793
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:15,288
twenty-four hours,
they can't all be blank.

794
01:40:17,358 --> 01:40:19,154
They are not.

795
01:40:20,196 --> 01:40:23,426
What explanation am l
to offer Their Majesties?

796
01:40:23,632 --> 01:40:26,931
l was indisposed. l am better.

797
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:34,374
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that l have my duty to perform,

798
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:37,743
just as Your Royal
Highness has her duty.

799
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:39,383
Your Excellency,

800
01:40:39,587 --> 01:40:44,115
l trust you will not find it necessary
to use that word again.

801
01:40:44,325 --> 01:40:49,695
Were l not completely aware of
my duty to my family and my country,

802
01:40:49,899 --> 01:40:53,027
l would not have come back tonight.

803
01:40:58,309 --> 01:41:00,606
Or indeed, ever again.

804
01:41:07,988 --> 01:41:15,020
And now, since l understand
we have a very full schedule today,

805
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:18,529
you have my permission to withdraw.

806
01:41:34,287 --> 01:41:37,654
No milk and crackers.

807
01:41:43,898 --> 01:41:47,561
That will be all thank you, Countess.

808
01:42:47,844 --> 01:42:50,972
- Did you really get it?
- What?

809
01:42:51,181 --> 01:42:54,081
The princess exclusive.
Did you get it?

810
01:42:54,284 --> 01:42:57,253
- No, l didn't.
- What? That's impossible.

811
01:42:57,456 --> 01:42:59,947
- Coffee?
- Don't hold out on me.

812
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,492
- Who's holding out?
- You are. l know too much.

813
01:43:03,697 --> 01:43:08,191
First you ask about an exclusive
on the princess, next you disappear.

814
01:43:08,403 --> 01:43:12,931
Then l hear a rumour from the
embassy that she's out on the town.

815
01:43:13,142 --> 01:43:16,600
Do you believe every rumour
that comes your way?

816
01:43:16,813 --> 01:43:21,580
There's a lot of other rumours.
About a shindig down by the river,

817
01:43:21,786 --> 01:43:25,745
and the arrest of eight secret
service men from a certain country.

818
01:43:25,957 --> 01:43:30,860
Then she makes
a miraculous recovery. lt all adds up.

819
01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:37,368
Don't think you'll raise the price,
a deal's a deal. Now come on.

820
01:43:37,572 --> 01:43:41,440
- Where is that story?
- l have no story.

821
01:43:43,779 --> 01:43:47,840
- Now what was the idea...
- Joe.

822
01:43:48,051 --> 01:43:50,485
- Wait till you see these.
- lrving.

823
01:43:50,687 --> 01:43:52,654
Hi, Mr Hennessy.

824
01:43:52,857 --> 01:43:54,222
lrving!

825
01:43:56,528 --> 01:44:00,362
- What's the idea?
- You charge in, spilling things!

826
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,229
- Me?
- l warned you before.

827
01:44:03,436 --> 01:44:06,428
- Remember?
- Look at my pants.

828
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:10,303
- Come and dry them off.
- Nuts to that.

829
01:44:10,512 --> 01:44:13,276
- Did you tell him about Smitty?
- Who?

830
01:44:13,483 --> 01:44:16,042
- Wait till you...
- lrving!

831
01:44:16,252 --> 01:44:18,652
There you go again, lrving.

832
01:44:21,126 --> 01:44:24,356
- Joe...
- Save that till later.

833
01:44:24,562 --> 01:44:29,090
- Why don't you go home and shave?
- Shave?

834
01:44:29,302 --> 01:44:32,863
Or else keep quiet
till we're finished talking.

835
01:44:33,073 --> 01:44:35,473
What kind of routine is that?

836
01:44:35,676 --> 01:44:37,643
What are you up to? Who's Smitty?

837
01:44:37,846 --> 01:44:41,043
- A guy we met.
- What is there to look at?

838
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:45,016
Just some of lrving's dames.
You wouldn't like them.

839
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:48,485
- Maybe you would.
- Don't change the subject.

840
01:44:48,692 --> 01:44:51,889
- Yesterday you said...
- l had a good lead.

841
01:44:52,097 --> 01:44:57,899
But l was wrong, that's all
there is to it. There is no story.

842
01:44:59,338 --> 01:45:00,634
OK.

843
01:45:00,841 --> 01:45:06,803
She's holding the press interview
today. Maybe you can get that story.

844
01:45:08,717 --> 01:45:10,480
And you owe me $500.

845
01:45:10,687 --> 01:45:15,488
- Take it from my salary, $50 a week.
- Don't think l won't.

846
01:45:17,827 --> 01:45:20,955
What gives?
Have we had a better offer?

847
01:45:21,165 --> 01:45:22,791
lrving...

848
01:45:23,302 --> 01:45:26,863
l don't know just how
to tell you this, but...

849
01:45:27,073 --> 01:45:29,267
Wait till l sit down.

850
01:45:31,078 --> 01:45:37,540
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these,

851
01:45:37,753 --> 01:45:40,244
there is no story.

852
01:45:41,524 --> 01:45:44,254
Why not?

853
01:45:44,461 --> 01:45:47,555
l mean, not as far as l'm concerned.

854
01:45:59,212 --> 01:46:05,014
The pictures came out pretty well.
Want to have a look at them?

855
01:46:15,099 --> 01:46:18,796
How about a blow-up
from a negative that size?

Wishes Come True.''

861
01:46:38,962 --> 01:46:40,428
Joe, that's good.

862
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:44,464

then follow up with the wishes?

863
01:46:44,669 --> 01:46:48,571
l got that from the file.
''Princess lnspects Police.''

864
01:46:48,774 --> 01:46:50,503
Yeah...

01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:53,873

872
01:47:11,134 --> 01:47:14,433
Oh, l get it. Joe, you got...

873
01:47:20,647 --> 01:47:22,841
She's fair game, Joe.

874
01:47:23,049 --> 01:47:25,745

875
01:47:28,089 --> 01:47:32,389

- l know, but...

876
01:47:32,594 --> 01:47:37,497

- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah.

878
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:50,907

- Are you?

879
01:47:51,117 --> 01:47:53,608
Yeah. lt's an assignment, isn't it?

880
01:47:54,555 --> 01:47:56,181
Yeah.

884
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:04,772
Her Royal Highness.

885

Does Your Highness believe

894
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:40,551
that federation could be a solution
to Europe's economic problems?

l am in favour of any measure

896
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:48,824
which would lead
to closer cooperation in Europe.

897
01:50:49,937 --> 01:50:52,667
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness,

898
01:50:52,874 --> 01:50:56,537
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

899

Each in its own way
was unforgettable.

906
01:51:54,116 --> 01:51:56,413
lt would be difficult to...

907
01:51:58,755 --> 01:52:04,058
