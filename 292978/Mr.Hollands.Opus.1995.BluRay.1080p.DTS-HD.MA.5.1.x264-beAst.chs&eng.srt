163
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,125
I thought so. Come with me. You're coming to the principal's office.

164
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,230
你们回家换过合格的裙子再来
We're calling your parents, and you are going home.

165

- 华老师,这不公平 -我很公正
- You can come back when you're dressed properly. - Oh, Mr. Wolters.

166

-教师不用排队 -你说什么?

172
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
高中不讲民主,老师不用排队
- Teachers don't wait. - Pardon me?

173
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,266
High school is not a democracy.

174
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,290
比尔?梅斯特,体育老师
Teachers don't wait. Bill Meister, phys. Ed.

Oh, my God, what is this?

180
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,970
可以当灰泥砌墙
It's Monday. It's turkey Spam surprise.

181
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,110

- 夜总会,婚礼,犹太成人典礼，诸如此类的 - 等等
I've been playin' music. Been on the road.

187

You know, um, clubs and weddings and bar mitzvahs.

188
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
我敢说你在那些会所酒吧 一定艳福不浅吧?
- That sort of thing. - Wait a minute.

189
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,460
夜总会美女如云你不要 却跑来这当老师?
I bet you met a ton of chicks in those clubs, huh?

190
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,376
So you're in these clubs, there are all these women there...

191
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,390
我教书是为了…
why'd you become a teacher?

192
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:45,088
Oh, actually I started teaching because...

193
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,890
希望有空闲作曲,其实我是作曲家

194
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,922
I was hoping it would give me some free time to do some composing.

195
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:52,593
I'm a composer. That's what I really do.

196
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,220
-有什么好笑的? -教书有空闲?
What? What's so funny?

197
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,970
霍兰,我都不记得我什么时候有过空闲
Oh, the free time.

198
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:02,266
Glenn, I can't remember the last time I had that was free.

[Children Chattering]

200
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,250
我都计划好了

201
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,670
你的薪水加上我摄影赚的钱
[Iris] I've got it all figured out.

202
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,210
再过四年,你就可以辞职
With your salary, plus what I take in with the photography...

203
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,720
专心作曲,来个名利双收
in four years we should have enough for you to quit...

204
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:41,831
and do nothing but compose music and become famous and make us rich.

205
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,270
-我撑不了四年 -我今天赚了32元

206
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,706
I'll never make it.

207
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,490
了不起 今天我可是让32个孩子 在课堂上昏昏欲睡
- I made us $32 today. - Big deal.

208
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,650
哦,对了.就是这儿!
I made 32 kids sleep with their eyes open. Ow!

209
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,320
就是这里
Right there. Right... Yeah.

210
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:56,713
Right there. Yeah.

Iris,

213
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:07,387
I think this is gonna be a lot rougher gig than I originally thought.

214
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,250
我上高中时…常常想逃课
[Sighs]

215
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:14,558
You know, when I was in high school, I wanted to be someplace else, you know.

216
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,290
只要不呆在学校就好

217
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,510
从来不知道我的老师们也会与我有同感
Anyplace. It never occurred to me that my teachers would feel the same way.

218
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,880
你现在就可以辞职

219
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,100
-不.我们说好的 -留在乐团也不错
Well, you can still quit.

220
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:27,149
Naw, we've been through all that.

221
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,190
是啊,余生都呆在假日酒店表演
I thought the band was getting pretty good actually.

222
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,490
-要不然去洛杉矶 -我不想做呆在录音棚里的音乐家
Yeah, yeah, we could play Holiday Inns for the rest of our lives.

223
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:37,697
- Or Los Angeles. - I don't want to be a studio musician.

224
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,560
那就再教四年书

225
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:39,865
So, it's four years teaching then.

226
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,860
过来

227
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:47,828
Come here.

228
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,590
你上高中时…

229
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,460
你有没有想过你的老师们 回家像我们这样?
When you were in high school...

230
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,590
我的高中老师都是牧师和修女
did you ever wonder if your teachers went home and got it on at night?

231
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:05,213
When I was in high school, my teachers were all priests and nuns.

232
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,390
高中时我曾迷恋格里菲思先生 随时都愿意让他领回家

233
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:07,924
I had such a crush on Mr. Griffith.

234
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,890
真的吗?
- He could have taken me home anytime. - Really?

235
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,260
格里菲思先生是谁?
- Mm-hmm. - And who was this Mr. Griffith?

236
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,850
我的音乐老师

237
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:20,680

你平常有足够时间练习吗?
Uh... [Chuckles]

260

And do you find that you get all the practice time that you need?

261
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,660
一直没有间断过

262
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,325
I practice constantly. Yeah.

264
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,090
我想我们…得花点时间做个别辅导
Well, then I think... I think maybe...

265
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:16,249
you and I should find some time to work on an individual basis.

That would be wonderful. I really, really, really want to do good at this.

当音符前有这样的降调符号时

276
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:09,531
When a flat precedes a note like this...

277
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,850
表示演奏时要降低半个音

278
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:14,491
it indicates that the note is to be played a half step lower.

"Name an American composer. "

287
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,800
“巴赫”?
- Miss Swedlin, your answer was? - Bach?

288
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,600
"约翰?塞巴斯蒂安?巴赫"(德国)
- [Student Giggles] - Johann Sebastian Bach.

289
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,100
这个答卷就更有意思
Oh, this... This is my favorite one.

290
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,530
“如何知道某个协奏曲是什么调式?”

"How do you know what key a concerto is in?"

292
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,860
米姆先生,你的答案是:“翻看乐谱第一页?”

293
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:54,509
Mr. Mims, your answer was:

294
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,178
"Look on the front page?"

295
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,990
这问号表示你不确定?

296
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,221
Now, this question mark. Was that because...

297
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,950
还是说你的英文和乐理一样差劲?
you weren't sure or because your English skills...

298

这些测验简直是浪费你我的时间!
are on the same level as your musical theory?

No kidding. I'd rather be somewhere else.

- I know what you meant. - Then?

321
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,784
- Why are you crying? - I'm terrible. I'm...

322
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,470
-嘴唇都吹肿了 -学乐器是要下苦功的

323
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:51,161
I'm terrible, Mr. Holland. I practice 'til my lips swell up.

324
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,180
可我吹出来的只是噪音
- Miss Lang, it takes a lot of work... - All I make is noise.

325
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,510
我只想有项专长
To learn a musical instrument.

326
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,430
我姐姐凭芭蕾奖学金上了朱丽亚音乐学院
I just want to be good at something.

327
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:02,503
My sister's got a ballet scholarship to go to Juilliard.

328
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,060
我哥哥得了圣母大学的橄榄球奖学金

329
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:07,380
And my brother's going to Notre Dame on a football scholarship.

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,990
我妈妈的水彩画多次获州冠军...

331
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:12,008
My mother's won the blue ribbon for watercolors at the state fair so many times...

332
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,660
以致主办方不得不停办这项比赛

333
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,070
我父亲有副天生的好嗓子
they've retired the category.

334
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:17,136
My father's got the most beautiful voice. He's...

335
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,240
我是全家唯一没...

336
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:23,723
I'm the only one in my family who's...

337
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,700
我...我就是...

338
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,808
I-I just can't...

339
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,010
怎么努力都没有用
It doesn't make any difference anyway.

340
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,645
I...

341
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,270
霍兰先生,我正要找你
Mr. Holland! Just the man I was looking for.

342
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,150
我们正为明年的课程筹组教材委员会

343
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,650
想听下你的意见,下周二晚开会
We're forming a textbook committee for next year's curriculum.

344
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,487
And I would like to have your ideas and suggestions.

345
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,030
抱歉,雅各布斯夫人,周二晚上我没空
- We meet next Tuesday night in the library. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Jacobs.

346
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,740
我观察你四、五个月了,霍兰先生
- I'm very busy on Tuesday night. - Uh- huh.

347
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:58,076
You know, for a good four or five months now, I've been watching you, Mr. Holland.

348
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,040
一放学你就冲向停车场

349
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,960
比你的学生跑得还快
I've never seen a teacher sprint for the parking lot after last period...

350
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,330
也许你更适合当我们的田径教练
with more speed and enthusiasm than his students.

351
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,510
雅各布斯夫人,我每天早晨是否准时到校?
Perhaps you should be our track coach.

352
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,834
Mrs. Jacobs, I get here on time every morning, don't I?

353
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,040
我对工作尽心尽力

354
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,380
老师的任务有二:传授知识
I'm doing my job the best I can.

355
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:17,756
A teacher is two jobs. Fill young minds with knowledge, yes.

356
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,760
但更重要是给他们指引方向

357
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,880
以免妄用知识
But more important, give those minds a compass...

358
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,550
我不知你传授知识做得怎么样,霍兰先生
so that that knowledge doesn't go to waste.

359
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,140
不过指南针作用，尚未得见
Now, I don't know what you're doing with the knowledge, Mr. Holland...

360
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,886
but as a compass you're stuck.

361
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,440
我恨死那女人!我更厌恶教书,艾莉丝

362
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:38,684
I really hate that woman. And I hate teaching, Iris. I hate it.

363
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,110
谁也教不好这些孩子!

364
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,730
我不知该怎么办
Nobody could teach these children. Nobody.

365
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,200
他们就只是呆坐在那儿望着我.心不在焉…
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

366
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:46,148
They just sit there staring up at me.

367
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,160
以前演出环境再差,听众不专心，你会罢演离开吗?
There's no there there. I've been trying to teach them...

368
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,108
Listen, you've played a lot of tough houses.

369
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,630
等等,我们不是同一国的吗?
- When they didn't listen, did you quit and go home? - Wait a minute.

370
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,470
我是支持你的
- Or keep playing? - Wait. Aren't we supposed to be on the same side?

371
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,630
只是…我…
I am. It's just that I...

372
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,550
我…

373
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,340
什么?
I...

374
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,369
What?

375
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,560
我怀孕了

376
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,663
I'm pregnant.

377
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:23,730
本来不是很确定,但是我去看了医生... 结果证实了
I wasn't... I wasn't sure if I was.

378
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,500
But I went to the doctor and I...

379
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:23,418
I am.

380
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,860
我们要有孩子了

381
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,131
We are.

382
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,670
你说话呀
S...

383
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,636
Say something.

384
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,723
Wow.

385
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,980
艾莉丝…
Iris.

386
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,450
-艾莉丝… -我有了,我就知道…
Iris.

387
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:18,330
-你会不高兴,但是… -艾莉丝,只是吓一跳,没别的
I... I don't know. I knew...

388
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,202
- I knew you wouldn't be, but I just... - Iris.

389
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:21,662
- Iris, it just took me by surprise. That's all. - I just hoped you...

390
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,140
讲个故事给你听好吗?

391
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,751
Let me tell you a story, okay?

392
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,970
我15岁时常在一家唱片店玩

393
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:37,337
When I was 15 years old, I used to hang out at a local record store.

394
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,850
有个店员,自以为懂我的口味，给了我一张唱片

395
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:40,673
And there was this guy who worked there who...

396
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,650
是约翰?柯尔的音乐  (爵士乐即兴演奏创始人之一,1967年去世)
you know, thought he knew what I liked and he handed me this album one day.

397
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,320
于是我拿回家来听
And it was John Coltrane.

398
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,400
我不喜欢 我真的很讨厌那音乐!
So I took it home, and I put it on the machine.

399
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,474
And I hated it. I mean, I really hated it.

400
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,030
我根本听不懂

401
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:59,308
I just didn't get it.

402
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,450
于是…我又听了一次

403
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,477
So I...

404
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,160
一遍又一遍…
played it again.

405
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,189
I played it again, and I played it again.

406
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,870
后来，我止不住地播放它

407
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:14,109
And then, I just couldn't stop playin' it.

408
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,970
聆听着每个音符

409
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,695
I kept listening to those notes.

410
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:25,180
然后我明白…那正是我终生要做的事业

411
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:23,865
And I realized that...

412
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:28,535
that's what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

413
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,480
你明白吗?

414
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,730
创作音乐
You know?

415
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,455
Make music.

416
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:42,211
[Sighs]

417
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:45,212
Tsk. [Sighs]

418
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,200
我想说的是…

419
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,589
What am I tryin' to say?

420
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,870
艾莉丝,当你说…

421
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,250
我们要有孩子了
Look, Iris.

422
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:58,178
Look, you... You tell me that...

423
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:01,429
we're gonna have a baby.

424
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:04,264
Well...

425
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:12,440
这就好像…跟约翰?柯尔再谈一次恋爱…

426
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,810
that's like falling in love with John Coltrane...

427
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,854
all over again.

428
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,110
就算你说谎,也是最美丽的谎言

429
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:21,775
If that is a lie...

430
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:25,360
that is the sweetest lie I ever heard.

431
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,420
请大家坐好

432
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:37,116
- [Bell Rings] - Let's take our seats, please.

433
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,340
谁能说出爱奥尼亚音阶和多里安音阶的分别?
Anybody here know the difference between the Ionian and the Dorian scale?

434
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,090
谁知道?
- [Girl] Uh-yeah. - Anybody?

435
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,920
我只想证实…
[Chuckles]

436
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,930
五个月来我没有让你们有丝毫的长进
I just wanted to confirm the fact that...

437
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:58,588
I've made absolutely no impact on you in the last five months.

438
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,600
沙利文先生
Mr. Sullivan.

439
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,110
你喜欢哪类音乐?
Yeah?

440
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,301
What kind of music do you like to listen to?

441
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,070
大胆讲
- Um... - Don't be afraid.

442
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,330
摇滚乐
Rock and roll.

443
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,950
-你呢? -摇滚乐
- What about you? - Rock and roll.

444
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,210
-你呢? -古典音乐

445
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,740
马屁精
- You? - Classical.

446
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:22,769
Brownnoser.

447
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,670
有人喜欢巴赫吗?
[Students Laughing]

448
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:27,688
Does anybody here like Johann Sebastian Bach?

449
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,800
除了你?

450
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:34,510
我相信大家...无论知道与否...都对巴赫的音乐有好感
Other than you.

451
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,819
I'll bet all of you, whether you know it or not...

452
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,027
already like Johann Sebastian Bach.

453
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,615
Dd

454
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,270
-这首曲名叫什么? -“恋人协奏曲”
What's this called?

455
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,860
-谁写的? -玩具合唱团
[Together] "Lover's Concerto. "

456
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,577
- Who wrote it? - The Toys.

457
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,230
错了!
Wrong.

458
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,450
这是G大调小步舞曲,作曲者是巴赫
That was "Minuet in G. "

459
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:58,667
And it was written by Johann Sebastian Bach.

460
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,120
听出来了吗?
You hear it?

461
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:11,965
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum dd

462
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,920
他在1725年写的
And he wrote it in 1725.

463
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,720
这两首曲子都是爱奥尼亚音阶的典型例子

464
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:19,219
They are both prime examples of the Ionian scale.

465
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:25,060
现在听听这个,看看你们能不能... 听得出来 这支曲… 和刚才那支有何关连?

466
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:23,181
Now, listen, and see if you can hear the connective tissue...

467
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,057
between what I just played and this.

468
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,560
（摇滚乐）

469
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:31,684
[Rock And Roll]

470
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:42,359
Dd

471
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,609
[Holland] Whoo!

472
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:52,823
Dd

473
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,250
他们把手举到半空，争相发言

474
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:55,991
And their hands were up in the air and they were answering questions.

475
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,660
真好玩，真过瘾
And it was so much fun. It was rowdy, you know.

476
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,230
真是太棒了
It was... It was just great.

477
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,630
嘿嘿嘿,让我们瞧瞧...

478
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,180
只返工两次,用了三小时就拼好了
Hey, hey, hey. Let... What do we think, huh?

479
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:10,916
And it only took two tries and three hours.

480
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,800
你忘记你有一个心灵手巧的老公了吗

481
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,270
但现在我们真的好挤
Well, you didn't realize you'd married such a handy man, did ya?

482
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,128

他真可爱

649
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,502
He's beautiful.

650
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:49,712
- [Yawning] - [Laughing]

651
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:53,130
[Sputtering]

652
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:56,589
[Coughing]

653
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,600
“有位老太太,把苍蝇吞下肚”
[Piano]

654
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,649
I know an old lady who swallowed a fly

655
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,180
“为何吞苍蝇,我不明白”
I don't know why she swallowed that fly

656
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,600
“或许她会活不下来”

657
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,240
“有位老太太,把蜘蛛吞下肚”
Perhaps she'll die

658
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:36,363
- I know an old lady - [Chuckling]

659
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:42,950
“蜘蛛爬上爬下 她肚里奇痒难耐”
Who swallowed a spider

660
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,909
That wiggled and jiggled

661
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:45,203
And tickled inside her

662
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,050
“吞下蜘蛛去抓苍蝇”

663
00:40:46,497 --> 00:40:50,790
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly

664
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,790
“但为何吞苍蝇,我不明白”

665
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,748
I don't know why

666
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,001
- [Laughing] - She swallowed that fly

667
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,050
“或许她会活不下来”

668
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,290
这孩子有音乐天份
Perhaps she'll die The kid is a natural.

669
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,880
一定是怀他时  你放的那些胎教音乐

670
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:03,548
It must have been all that music you played at my stomach while I was pregnant.

671
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,010
各位,无线电城音乐厅荣誉推出
[Upbeat Jazz]

672
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:10,469
Ladies and gentlemen, Radio City Music Hall...

673
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,640
柯尔?格什温?霍兰! (都是音乐大师的名字)
is proud to present Coltrane Gershwin Holland.

674
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:20,682
Dd

675
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,520
霍兰先生,我注意到…

676
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,990
你在教学生摇滚乐
Mr. Holland, it has come to my attention...

677
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:26,728
that you are teaching the students rock and roll.

678
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,120
-这有问题吗? -"有问题吗?" 是的,我认为有
- Is this a problem? - "Is this a problem?" Yes, I think so.

679
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,120
我们唯一的职责是教学

680
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,910
如果没纪律,老师没法教,学生没法学
Our only job is to teach.

681
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,317
We cannot teach and the students cannot learn if there is no discipline.

682
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,750
抱歉,你究竟想说什么,吉恩?
Uh, I'm sorry, uh, what exactly is your point, Gene?

683
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,580
我是说,这种涣散的音乐会导致秩序的败坏

684
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:45,198
My point is, rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline.

685
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,510
你要我怎么做? 要我只当摇滚乐不存在?
What would you like me to do? Deny that rock and roll exists?

686
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,970
我认为...我们认为你应该教授古典音乐

687
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:52,159
What I am... What we are saying is that you should be pushing the classics.

688
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,470
布拉姆斯,莫扎特.以及史特拉文斯基
Brahms, Mozart, Stravinsky.

689
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,270
说到秩序的瓦解,史特拉文斯基的音乐正是推翻沙皇的音乐
Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution...

690
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,390
-你夸大其词. -那么,"金斯顿三重唱" 如何? 
if you want to talk about a breakdown in discipline.

691
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:03,082
- You are deliberately exaggerating. - How about the Kingston Trio?

692
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,480
- "和米奇一起唱"(唱片名)又怎么说? - 二位,等一下!

693
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,584
- How about Sing Along With Mitch? - Oh, please!

694
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:12,240
霍兰先生 我不想干涉任何老师的教学
Just a minute, gentlemen.

695
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:14,091
Mr. Holland, I do not want to interfere in the curriculum of any teacher.

696
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,790
但是下周我要和校董开会

697
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:16,883
But next week I have a meeting with the school board.

698
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,000
有些董事深信摇滚是"魔鬼之音"
And there are people in this community who believe...

699
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,678
that rock and roll is a message sent from the devil himself.

700
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,920
那么当提及这话题 我该如何对他们说?
Now when that issue comes up, what can I tell them?

701
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,510
雅各布斯夫人
Mrs. Jacobs, you tell them...

702
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,420
你告诉他们…我是在教音乐

703
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:39,146
that I am teaching music...

704
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,350
从贝多芬到比利·哈乐黛（爵士歌星）再到摇滚乐

705
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:41,147
and that I will use anything...

706
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:45,109
from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock and roll...

707
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,190
只要能让学生爱上音乐 我都乐于采用

708
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:50,944
if I think it'll help me teach a student... to love music.

709
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,280
你的回答...
That's...

710
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,940
合情合理 霍兰先生
a reasonable answer, Mr. Holland.

711
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,490
我可以向校董会交代了
I can tell them that.

712
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,410
还有事吗?
Was there something else?

713
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,580
有…

714
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,170
本赛季你有没有去看过球赛?霍兰先生
Yes, um, have you been...

715
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,750
to any of the football games this season, Mr. Holland?

716
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,630
说不上有,没看过

717
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,250
雅各布斯夫人和我都觉得赛场少了点什么
I can't say that I have. No.

718
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:22,964
Well, Mrs. Jacobs and I feel that there's something missing.

719
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,640
触地得分?
Touchdowns. [Laughing]

720
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,100
对不起
I'm sorry. [Laughing]

721
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,350
关于军乐队,你了解多少?
What do you know about marching bands?

722
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,190
您说什么?
Pardon me?

723
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,190
准备!开始!
Blue, 32! Set, hut!

724
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,990
扑他!扑倒他!
[Grunting]

725
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,030
-(霍兰先生)嘿嘿嘿 -就是这样!这才叫擒抱
Get him! Get him down! [Whistle Blows]

726
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,976
[Coach Meister] That's the way.

727
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:49,187
- [Mr. Holland] Hey, hey, hey. - That's the way to crash down.

728
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,740
鼓和低音号
Uh, drums and sousaphones.

729
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,830
排在这里,低音号站两侧

730
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:56,609
Come on, line up here. Sousaphones on either side.

731
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,130
中音号,萨克斯,在第三列
And, baritones, and, and saxes.

732
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,140
衣服塞进去!这不是开派对!
Here. Third line.

733
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,350
那也不是礼服,给我塞进去!
Put your shirttail in! This isn't a dance.

734
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,430
稍微快些,我们不想在这儿耗到天黑
It looks like a party dress. Get it in!

735
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:12,243
Let's do it a little quicker. You know, we don't wanna be here 'til it's dark.

736
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,150
我们人数不是偶数 我想…

737
00:44:12,244 --> 00:44:14,661
Now, we're not... We're not even.

738
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,320
你在这里取齐 …
I'd like to make some attempt to, um...

739
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,360
你明白我说"取齐"的意思吗?
Can you even up here? Can you, like, even this...

740
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,520
排成一排...对了
Do you understand what I'm saying when I say "even up"?

741
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,490
好了,下次要注意取齐
Line up. There you go.

742
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:30,252
All right, all right. Take care of even some... next time.

743
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,620
过来!他们在那边,你却在这里,你在搞什么?

744
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,870
-对不起. -你想气死我吗?
- Get over here! - All right.

745
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:33,589
They're over there. You're over here. What are you doing?

746
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,280
看我的手势,好吗?
- Sorry, Coach. - Are you trying to kill me?

747
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,500
一,二,三,齐步走!
Watch my hand, okay?

748
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:42,219
One, two, three, march.

749
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:46,920
左,右,左,右,左,右…

750
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,388
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

751
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,840
不,不对!
- Left, right, left, right. - [Boy Murmuring] This is stupid.

752
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,520
-左,右,左,右,左,右,对  -约翰,球队单膝下跪休息
No, no, no. Left, right, left, right.

753
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,270
不对,挤成一团了
- Left, right, left, right. - Hey, John, let 'em take a knee.

754
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,390
不,不,大家散开,散开!
No, no, no. We're clumping. You're clumping up.

755
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,390
散开!散开!
No, no, no, people. Spread out. I want you to spread!

756
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,810
然后转过来,转过来继续
- [Boy] He said "spread. " - Spread out. Spread.

757
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:07,983
And turn. Turn around and keep marching.

758
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:13,700
齐步走!左,右,左,右…

759
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:11,860
Keep marching. Left, right, left, right.

760
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:17,363
Left, right, left, right. Left...

761
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,330
停!单膝下跪休息
[Sighs]

762
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,034
[Whistle Blowing] Stop! Take a knee.

763
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,220
好了,跑步去,戴上头盔!
- [Football Players Laughing] - All right, start runnin'.

764
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,130
哨音没响不准停
Hats on! And don't stop 'til you hear this whistle.

765
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,810
格伦,格伦
Glenn. Glenn.

766
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,350
好家伙,真要命!
Man, oh, man, oh, man. Oh, man!

767
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,220
我猜你从未在军队呆过
I take it you were never in the army.

768
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,890
还用问吗?
[Both Laugh]

769
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:47,507
Now, that's a stupid question.

770
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,070
我服过役,齐步走,练得我快累死了

771
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:52,885
I was. Man, I marched my keister off.

772
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,150
那就帮帮我啊

773
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:55,512
Well, then, help me out.

774
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,900
好哇!

775
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,160
看到看台上那个孩子了吗?他叫卢拉斯
Okay. You see this kid up in the stands here?

776
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,500
是本校有史以来最好的中卫  因为功课不好,被我赶出队
That's Lou Russ. He was the greatest halfback this school ever had.

777
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,540
现在连摔跤队也不能待了
I had to toss him off the team because of his grades.

778
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,210
你想我怎样?要我代他去考试?
Now I'm about to lose him for wrestling if I don't get 'em up.

779
00:46:11,314 --> 00:46:14,856
Bill, what are we talkin' about? What do you want me to do? Take his tests for him?

780
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,880
不是

781
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,250
你如果让他参加乐队
No, but I bet if he played in your band...

782
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,470
校长就会给他学分 我就帮你操练队伍

783
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:21,819
I could talk Jacobs into giving him an academic credit...

784
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,470
-他会什么乐器? -都不会
and then I'll help ya out here.

785
00:46:24,238 --> 00:46:27,613
- What instrument does he play? - He doesn't.

786
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,350
一样也不会
He doesn't play anything. [Laughing]

787
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,530
-你开玩笑吗? -不,他会适应的
What? Are you kidding?

788
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,940
格伦 你让他随便玩个乐器…
No, he'll fit right in.

789
00:46:39,706 --> 00:46:44,458
Glenn, listen, you get him to play anything...

790
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,870
我就教他们走步

791
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,752
and I'll get them to march.

792
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,880
各位,我是麦斯特教练,来陪你们操练
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Coach Meister...

793
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,880
拉斯先生,你对音乐有何认识?
your marching buddy.

794
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,710
- 没有!教练先生  - 你不用再加一个"先生",我也不是教练
- You know anything at all about music, Mr. Russ? - No, sir, coach.

795
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,630
就叫我霍兰先生吧
You don't have to say "sir, " and I'm not a coach.

796
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,880
对不起,先生... 我是说,霍兰先生
So Mr. Holland is just fine.

797
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,640
不用道歉,你没做错什么
Sorry, sir... I mean, Mr. Holland.

798
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:11,348
Don't apologize. You haven't done anything yet.

799
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,190
你会看乐谱吗?哪怕一丁点?
Um, you know how to read music even a little?

800
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,730
-不会 -不会 -不会

00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,960
艾莉丝!
Iris. Cole.

956
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,120
柯尔!

957
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,910
游行好玩吗?
Was that fun or what?

958
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,170
柯尔有点不太对劲
There's something wrong with Cole.

959
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,250
-怎样? -不知道,但我用尽办法
I don't know, but I've... I've tried different things.

960
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:36,550
从背后吓他…敲锅子,大声喊他名字…

961
00:57:33,176 --> 00:57:36,384
Um, sneaking up behind him and...

962
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,310
跺脚
banging pots and screaming his name and stomping on the floor.

963
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,970
我跺脚他才回头.咧嘴笑,以为我在跟他玩
He... He turned when I did that. Big smile.

964
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,150
艾莉丝
- He thought I was playing a game. - Iris.

965
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,320
我猜他听不见
I don't think he can hear.

966
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,530
柯尔!
Cole?

967
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,790
柯尔?
[Clapping] Cole?

968
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,080
柯尔?

969
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:16,117
Cole! [Clapping]

970
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,840
柯尔?
Cole? [Clapping]

971
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,350
柯尔有90%听力受损
Cole has a 90% hearing loss.

972
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,890
如果加以训练 他会学会利用那仅剩余的听力
Now, with training he will learn to use what hearing he has left.

973
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:33,070
像对正常小孩一样待他 即使他听不见也要跟他讲话

974
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:34,754
Treat him as if he's normal. Talk to him as if he can hear you.

975
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,890
我注意到柯尔习惯用手势来表达

976
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:38,464
I notice Cole uses gestures to help himself be understood.

977
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,040
我提醒你们不要用手势来回应

978
00:58:38,508 --> 00:58:42,300
Let me caution you, don't use them back.

979
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,900
手势表达无助于帮他立足社会
Gestures won't help him find his place in a hearing world.

980
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,120
等他大一点,有专门学校教他讲话
When he's older, there are schools that will help him and you to find his voice.

（贝多芬"A大调第七交响曲"）

982
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:57,726
[Beethoven: "Symphony No. 7 In A Major"]

983
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,880
他听不见

984
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:12,180
芸芸众生之中,偏偏是他 一点都听不见
He couldn't hear.

985
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,942
Of all people.

986
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:13,485
Not a thing.

987
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,060
正因为贝多芬听不见
And because Beethoven couldn't hear, the thought of him conducting...

988
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:22,740
绝大多数人都认为他的指挥或作曲...乏善可陈

989
00:59:19,364 --> 00:59:24,491
or let alone composing... was pathetic to most people.

990
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:27,280
为了回应这些人 他谱写了第七交响乐,并指挥公演

991
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:29,828
And so to answer them, he composed and conducted the "Seventh Symphony. "

992
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:31,703
[Continues]

993
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,000
想想看…
Just try to imagine...

994
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,530
贝多芬站在指挥台上…
Beethoven standing on that podium...

995
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,210
手执指挥棒…
holding his baton...

996
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,420
优雅地挥舞着双手…
his hands waving gracefully through the air...

997
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:51,010
心中的乐团正完美地演出

998
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,632
and the orchestra in his mind...

999
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:53,092
is playing perfectly.

1000
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,280
而他面前的乐团…却拚命地在跟上他的节拍
And the orchestra in front of him...

1001
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,888
trying desperately just to keep up.

1002
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,860
还有个故事…
[Clicks Tongue] There is a story...

1003
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,440
为了创作…

1004
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:12,937
that in order to write his music...

1005
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,900
贝多芬断然锯掉钢琴脚
Beethoven literally sawed the legs off his piano...

1006
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,120
使琴身贴在地板上

1007
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:20,775
so that he could lay the body flat on the ground.

1008
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,700
然后…
And then...

1009
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:27,920
他躺在钢琴旁边,耳朵紧贴着地板
he would lay down on the ground next to the piano...

1010
01:00:27,197 --> 01:00:30,614
with his ear pressed to the floor.

1011
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,840
用手指敲打键盘…
And he would pound the keys with his fingers...

1012
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,980
想靠着感受地板的震动听到音乐
in order to hear his music through the vibrations...

1013
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,470
霍兰先生...?
of the floor.

1014
01:00:44,665 --> 01:00:49,333
Mr. Holland? Mr. Holland?

1015
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,980
霍兰先生...?

1016
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,980
如果他听不见  怎么辨别音调?
If he couldn't hear, how would he even know what the notes were?

1017
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:02,290
比如,如果他从来没有听过C调 那他怎么知道他想要的是什么调?

1018
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:02,008
Like, if he never heard a "C... "

1019
01:01:02,009 --> 01:01:05,260
how'd he know that's what he wanted played?

1020
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,500
因为…
Well...

1021
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,090
贝多芬不是天生耳聋的

意味着柯尔或许永远不会读唇语或说话!
That gestures meant that Cole would never learn how to lip-read or to talk!

-恐怕不行  -好吧 我们会解决的

1093
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,260
要多久他才能学会手语?
[Iris] Well, we can handle it.

1094
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:29,743
Uh, so... so how long would it be before he learns how to sign?

1095
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:33,430
比你俩都快 小孩学东西很快 
Well, not as long as it'll take the two of you.

1096
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,220
而大人学 就要看用不用心了

我知道有人会不高兴 但今年我们打算...全部取消高年级演出项目
I know this is going to bother some of you, but I think we have to consider...

1246
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,090
- 你疯了不成? -各位... - 太不可思议了,我反对
cutting the senior class play altogether this year.

1247
01:16:50,112 --> 01:16:52,196
- Are you nuts? Yes! You know what? - People, people.

1248
01:16:53,220 --> 01:17:01,040
请冷静 别忘了我们开会的目的  我们要想办法为学校省钱 而非花钱
Oddly enough, it's going to bother me!

1249
01:16:54,197 --> 01:16:56,322
People, people. Please.

1250
01:16:56,324 --> 01:16:58,616
Let's keep in mind why we are here.

1251
01:16:58,617 --> 01:17:02,034
We're looking for things which will keep money in the school coffers, not take it away.

1252
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,300
- 带来的后果呢? -我要对校董事会负责...
- At the expense of what? - I have a responsibility to the Board of Education...

1253
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,130
而且我们也没有资金可用来搞这类东西

1254
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:11,190
那我们教这些有什么用? 
and there just isn't the money to fund programs like this; not anymore.

1255
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,123
Then what am I doing here? I mean, why are we teaching any of this?

1256
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:14,560
-这对我来说非常重要  -打扰一下,吉恩
- This is the kind of thing that's important to me. - Excuse... Excuse me, Gene.

1257
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,320
比尔,你说?
Yes? Bill?

1258
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,450
我可以保证今年的演出一定会赚钱
I think I can guarantee that this year's show will make money.

1259
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:26,520
-继续说下去. -让我的球员们来当舞蹈演员...
- I'm listening. - What if we get some of my football players...

1260
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,540
观众一定会蜂拥而至来看他们台上的糗样
to be the dancers in the show...

1261
01:17:27,717 --> 01:17:30,634
and then people will show up in droves just to see them fall on their asses.

1262
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,870
比尔,我们不是要演一出闹剧
- [Chuckling] - Bill, I don't want to turn this into a farce.

1263
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,540
当然,我们把他们训练成舞蹈演员
It wouldn't be a farce, because we would get them...

1264
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,910
好得让人吃惊
to be better than the damn June Taylor Dancers, and then that'll shock the hell out of everybody.

1265
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:41,210
谁来教足球队员跳舞?
Who's going to teach the football players how to dance?

1266
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,840
我!
- Me. - [Teachers Laughing]

1267
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,010
-你行吗? -我辅修现代舞
You?

1268
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,438
I minored in modern dance.

1269
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,760
他辅修现代舞
- He minored in modern dance, Gene. - [Teachers Chuckling]

1270
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,930
真的,教练逼我们学的 这样运动才能更优雅
I did. The coach had us do it...

1271
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:03,363
so we'd be more graceful.

1272
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,480
格伦,帮我抬腿,快
- Glenn, hold my leg. Come on. - Hmm.

1302
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,300
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1303
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,270
- 我们还缺一个女主角 - 别担心,还有几个等着试唱
[Inhales]

1304
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:35,833
- We still don't have an ingenue. - Don't worry. We still have a few more people to see yet.

1305
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,650
比利?法拉第可以演葛希文...
All right, Billy Faraday can pull off the Gershwin...

1306
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,570
但到目前为止女主角 只能让托德?马卡姆反串

1307
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:41,504
but the only ingenue we seem to have so far is ToMarkam.

1308
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,660
我认为托德...或其父母...不会...
I really don't think that ToMarkam... or his parents...

1314
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:56,280
纯属个人意见,但我想她比托德更合适

1315
01:19:54,013 --> 01:19:56,763

Very good. Miss... ?

1325
01:20:26,532 --> 01:20:29,574
Morgan. Rowena Morgan.

1326
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,620
非常好
Very good. You were very, very good.

1327
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:34,830
你唱得非常好,非常感谢!

1328
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:36,870
Thank you very much.

1329
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,750
嘿,科学展览会怎么样?
Hey. How was the science fair?

1330
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,220
- 你想去哪儿? -上太空
- You want to go to the what? - Stars. Cole discovered astronomy tonight.

1331
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,680
今晚柯尔知道了天文学

1332
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,800
噢,噢!慢一点,你快得像火箭!
Whoa. Whoa. Slow down. Slow down. You're goin' like a rocket.

1333
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,060
他想当宇航员
He wants to be an astronaut.

1334
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,280
很好
Good.

1335
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,450
-谁给他灌输的这种想法? -他的老师
Who put that stuff in his head?

1336
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:14,894
As a matter of fact, his teachers.

1337
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,700
你不是说要来和我们会合吗?
- I thought you were going to meet us. - Well, I wanted to...

1338
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,960
我想去,...但我得在周末前把曲子写完

1339
01:21:20,273 --> 01:21:23,232
but I had to get these orchestrations finished by the end of the week for the kids.

1340
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,120
我们要演出葛希文音乐剧
We're gonna do a Gershwin revue.

1341
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,410
你总是有事,对不对?
It's always something, isn't it? If it isn't a school play, it's band practice...

1342
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,300
不是排戏  就是乐队练习

1343
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:32,680
要不然就是阅卷或者辅导某个学生团体
or grading papers or some student committee needs an advisor.

1344
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:36,170
-错过科技展又不是世界末日  -今早你听见我说的话了吗?
Missing the science fair isn't the end of the world.

1345
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:39,810
-我都听见了 -他希望今晚你能陪他!
- Maybe you didn't hear me this morning. - I heard you. I always hear you.

1346
01:21:38,867 --> 01:21:40,741
He wanted you to be there tonight!

1347
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,760
天啊!
Oh, God. You know, it's really amazing.

1348
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:47,230
真令人纳闷!无论我怎么付出...怎么努力

1349
01:21:44,495 --> 01:21:48,204
No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try...

1350
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,600
结果总是我的错
sooner or later anything I try turns out being wrong.

1351
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,530
为何人家的儿子比自己的重要?
Why is every other child more important to you than your child?

1352
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,200
-我是老师,艾莉丝. -你是他的父亲!
- I'm a teacher, Iris! - You are his father!

1353
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,370
两者都是!
I'm both!

1354
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,620
我这样做,会让儿子伤心 我那样做,又会令学校失望
I do one thing: I let him down.

1355
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,830
我要怎么做才能让所有人都满意?
I do another thing: I let the school down.

1356
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,580
-事情要分轻重缓急 -我正是这样!
How the hell am I supposed to be everything for everybody?

1357
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:09,968
- You have to make priorities. - I have!

1358
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:12,790
我爱我的儿子,我尽力为他做到最好
He's my son and I love him. And I do the best I goddamn can.

1359
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,880
知道吗?你的"最好"还远远不够
Well, you know what? Your best isn't good enough.

1360
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,260
好吧 去吧 去写你的曲子吧!
So go on. Write your music.

1361
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,930
写我的曲子?我哪有时间呀?
[Exhales] Write my music, huh?

1362
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:26,185
Write my music! When do I have time to write my music?

1363
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:37,770
“可否请他快马加鞭”
# Won't you tell him please to put on some speed #

1364
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,780
“跟着我的指引”
# Follow my lead #

1365
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:44,110
“我是多么需要”

1366
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:46,781
# Oh, how I need #

1367
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:51,210
“一个守护我...”
# Someone to watch #

1368
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:57,210
“...的人”
# Over me #

1369
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:01,470
太完美了,亲爱的

1370
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,340
-霍兰先生? -唱得好
That was perfect, darling. Mr. Holland.

1371
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,920
-我可以跟她谈谈吗? -当然可以
- It was good. Can I talk to her for a second? - Sure.

1372
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:09,220
大家先休息一下
Let's all take a break for a minute.

1373
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,560
我已尽最大努力把它唱好
- I was trying to sing my best. - It was fine.

1374
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,730
唱得不错 我只想问你一个问题

1375
01:23:14,715 --> 01:23:16,840
I just want to ask you a question.

1376
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:21,320
你了解女主角的心境吗?
[Inhales]

1377
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:23,385
What do you think... the girl's really feeling here?

1378
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:27,570
-不了解. -非了解不可
- I don't know. - You have to know...

1379
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,320
否则唱不好
or you can't sing it.

1380
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,950
摩根小姐,这首歌诉说一种渴望...
This song is wistful, Miss Morgan.

1381
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,290
在一个非常非常冷漠的世界里...
It's about a woman who is alone in a very, very cold world...

1382
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:44,290
一位孤单的女子,盼望有人来拥她入怀
and all she wants more than anything is to have someone hold her close...

1383
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:48,720
并且告诉她一切都会好起来
and to tell her that everything's gonna be all right.

1384
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:57,020
这首歌倾诉内心深处对爱的渴望
It's about...

1385
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:54,529
the need for love...

1386
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,822
in your gut.

1387
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,140
懂了吗?
Okay?

1388
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,430
好 从头再来
Try it again, from the top.

1389
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,480
这次我要低一点的调
This time I wanna do it in a lower key.

1390

- Fifteen seconds. - I think that the big difference is how little you people care.

1816

也许贴些小广告教钢琴课吧
Probably hang out a shingle and teach a few piano lessons.

1845
02:03:10,009 --> 02:03:11,883
[Exhales]

1846
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:13,510
我倒喜欢退休...
- I'd love to retire. I'd... - I'm not retiring, Bill.

1847
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:17,570
我不是退休,比尔 是被遗弃

1848
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:17,889
I'm getting dumped.

1849
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:22,780
但你没什么好担心的
[Sighs] And I don't think you have anything to worry about.

1850
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:26,040
如果有砍掉足球经费的那一天
The day they cut the football budget in this state, well, now...

1851
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:29,960
一定是西方文明终结之日
that will be the end of western civilization as we know it.

1852
02:03:31,897 --> 02:03:35,898
[Sighs] I'll tell you the truth.

1853
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:35,470
跟你说句实话

1854
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:39,775
[Chuckles] I'm scared to death.

1855
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:40,470
(退休的生活)其实我怕得要死

1856
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,580
大家都会想念你的
They have no idea how much they're gonna miss you around here.

1857
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:47,770
- 你真的那样想? - 怎么,你怀疑? -事实上,我不信
- You really think so? - What, do you doubt it?

1858
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:48,406
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah.

1859
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:53,940
说来好笑,当初闹着说不干
It's almost funny. I got dragged into this gig kicking and screaming...

1860
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:56,910
如今却是我唯一想做的事业
and now, it's the only thing I want to do, and...

1861
02:03:56,954 --> 02:03:58,954
[Sighs]

1862
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:02,450
工作了一生…
You work your whole life.

1863
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:09,490
教了三十年 因为相信自己可以改变什么
You work for 30 years because you think that what you do makes a difference.

1864
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:12,540
相信自己对其他人有意义
You think it matters to people.

1865
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:16,920
但某天早上,你醒过来发现...
Then you wake up one morning, and you find out, well, no, you've...

1866
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:20,420
自己错了

1867
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:20,717
you've made a little error there.

1868
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:25,050
原来你是...可有可无的
You are...

1869
02:04:24,012 --> 02:04:26,012
expendable.

1870
02:04:28,055 --> 02:04:31,222
[Inhales Deeply] Oh, God.

1871
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:32,940
喔!天啊!
[Chuckles] Oh, I should be laughing.

1872
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:36,520
我真是好笑

1873
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:43,040
你真的不需要帮忙吗?
You sure you don't need any help, huh?

1874
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:47,370
好吧
All right.

1875
02:04:53,488 --> 02:04:57,405
[Sighs Deeply]

1876
02:04:57,407 --> 02:05:02,784
[Door Opens, Car Horn Honking]

1877
02:05:02,785 --> 02:05:05,035
[Door Closes]

1878
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,079
[Honking Continues]

1879
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:16,520
爸爸!
Dad!

1880
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:20,350
你怎么来了?
What are you doing here?

1881
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:23,190
学校放假了
School is out for me too.

1882
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,900
这部老爷车,看来还不错
The old car. It looks pretty good.

1883
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:29,660
这是古董车,你不能要回去
It's a classic. You can't have it back.

1884
02:05:33,804 --> 02:05:35,804
[Door Opens]

1885
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,750
不!不…你不用帮我搬
No, no.

1886
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:41,931
You don't have to do this.

1887
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:44,720
我不想有糟老头把自己给弄伤
I don't want an old fart like you to strain yourself.

1888
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:47,000
好吧 好吧,混球
Okay, okay, asshole.

1889
02:05:50,810 --> 02:05:52,930
你们两个闹够了没
[Sighs] That's enough, you two.

1890
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:55,100
我们出去吧
Let's go out to the car. [Clears Throat]

1891
02:06:31,004 --> 02:06:34,754
[Piano]

1892
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:36,760
那是什么声音?
Now what is that?

1893
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:38,930
不清楚
Um, I don't know.

1894
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:44,140
-什么?礼堂传来的声音你听不到? -我听到了,但…
What? You can't hear what's going on in the auditorium?

1895
02:06:42,135 --> 02:06:46,219
- Oh, yeah. I-I-I hear it, but... - Well, there's something going on in there.

1896
02:06:44,270 --> 02:06:47,140
好像有活动

1897
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:52,480
-暑假课程吗? -不会的,还有几个星期才开课
- There isn't supposed to be... - Well, it could be a summer program.

1898
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:52,432
No, the summer programs don't start for another couple of weeks.

1899
02:06:52,433 --> 02:06:55,517
# Louie, Louie #

1900
02:06:55,518 --> 02:06:59,686
# Oh, oh We gotta move now #

1901
02:06:59,710 --> 02:07:02,990
“标语："再见,霍兰先生!"”
[Cheering, Applause]

1902
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:32,560
霍兰先生
Mr. Holland!

1903
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:54,160
-史泰德勒先生? -霍兰先生,这场盛会我绝不能错过
Mr. Stadler?

1904
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:54,136
I wouldn't have missed it, Mr. Holland.

1905
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:21,520
你好 柯尔
Hi, Cole.

1906
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:42,580
我来用手语传译
Uh, I'll sign myself.

1907
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:50,300
你好…
Uh, hello. [Clears Throat]

1908
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:55,220
我们大会的支持人似乎迟到了
Our master of ceremonies seems to be a little late...

1909
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:58,480
所以还是我来开始吧
so I guess it's up to me to begin.

1910
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:03,110
当音乐课被取消…
Um, when word first got out that the music program was cut...

1911
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:06,570
和我丈夫要退休的消息传出后
and about the retirement of my husband...

1912
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:13,030
我从没料到,会在这社区 引起这么大的反响
Well, I've never seen such a response from the community.

1913
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,950
噢,看来我的表跑快了
Oh, looks like my watch is fast.

1914
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:20,950
各位先生女士,请允许我介绍我们的州长
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, may I present our governor...

1915
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:23,750
也是本校校友
and Kennedy High School alumnus...

1916
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,340
尊敬的格特鲁德?蓝格女士
the most Honorable Gertrude Lang.

1917
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,300
格特鲁德
- Gertrude. - [Chuckles] It's been a long time.

1918
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:36,630
好久不见了

1919
02:09:44,618 --> 02:09:46,618
[Chuckles]

1920
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:49,780
-谢谢你的光临. -噢…谢谢
- Thank you so much for coming. - Oh, thank you.

1921
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,740
很抱歉,我迟到了
My... My apologies for my tardiness, and, uh, Principal Wolters...

1922
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:07,830
报告华德斯校长,我有带家长证明的!
I'd like you to know... Yes, I brought a note from my mother.

1923
02:10:07,299 --> 02:10:09,173
[Audience Laughing]

1924
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:16,670
霍兰先生对我的一生有深远影响
Mr. Holland had a profound influence on my life.

1925
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:18,840
对我们许多人的一生也是一样
On a lot of lives, I know.

1926
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:25,300
但我觉得,他或许会认为…  自己的大部份人生都是虚度的
And, yet, I get the feeling...

1927
02:10:20,807 --> 02:10:25,975
that he considers a great part of his own life misspent.

1928
02:10:27,190 --> 02:10:30,270
据说他一直在创作自己的交响乐
Rumor had it, he was always working on this symphony of his...

1929
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:35,480
那可令他功成名就
and this was going to make him famous, rich.

1930
02:10:33,106 --> 02:10:35,606
Probably both.

1931
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:40,810
但是霍兰先生并未发财,也未出名
But Mr. Holland isn't rich...

1932
02:10:37,649 --> 02:10:40,983
and he isn't famous...

1933
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:43,660
小镇以外知道他的人不多
at least not outside of our little town.

1934
02:10:44,290 --> 02:10:48,030
他可能因此认为自己很失败
So it might be easy for him to think himself a failure.

1935
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,750
那么他就错了
And he would be wrong...

1936
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:57,080
因为他的成就远超乎名和利
because I think he's achieved a success far beyond riches and fame.

1937
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,090
环顾四周
Look around you.

1938
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:04,920
没有一个人不曾受你的影响
There is not a life in this room that you have not touched.

1939
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:10,470
因为你,我们才成为了更好的人
And each one of us is a better person because of you.

1940
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:14,600
霍兰先生,我们就是你的交响乐
We are your symphony, Mr. Holland.

1941
02:11:14,730 --> 02:11:18,180
我们就是你作品中跳跃的旋律和音符
We are the melodies and the notes of your opus.

1942
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:21,200
我们是你生命的乐章
And we are the music of your life.

1943
02:11:21,051 --> 02:11:23,551
[Cheering, Applause]

1944
02:11:25,512 --> 02:11:27,345
Whoo!

1945
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:48,710
霍兰先生,现在我们要回赠你一样东西
Mr. Holland, we would now like to give something back to you.

1946
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:55,760
三十年来 你和师母终于等到这一场音乐会
To you and to your wife...

1947
02:11:51,401 --> 02:11:56,528
who, along with you, has waited 30 years for what we are about to hear.

1948
02:11:56,690 --> 02:11:59,200
若你愿意,可否上来…
If you will, would you please come up here and take this baton...

1949
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,600
执起这指挥棒

1950
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:07,320
指挥我们首次公演...
and lead us in the first performance ever...

1951
02:12:02,207 --> 02:12:06,123
of "The American Symphony" by Glenn Holland.

# In a world of broken dreams #

1968
02:17:56,097 --> 02:17:59,137
# I was wrong #

1969
02:17:59,137 --> 02:18:03,737
# To deny your feelings #

1970
02:18:04,577 --> 02:18:07,057

# So confused then #

1974
02:18:21,097 --> 02:18:25,297
# I believe that #

1975
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:29,017
# You would change that #

# There are broken hearts we can mend #

1977
02:18:38,257 --> 02:18:46,937
# Through the music we've learned to love again #

1978

# Through the silence #

# Life with my heart #

1990

# By all the beauty I feel and create #

1991
02:20:17,017 --> 02:20:21,497
# It spins and moves #

1992
02:20:22,377 --> 02:20:26,497
# Flows at my pace #

# Telling its story #

1994
02:20:32,017 --> 02:20:38,017

02:21:14,337 --> 02:21:23,217
# Oh, yeah # # Can take your place by my side #

2004
02:21:23,217 --> 02:21:26,897
# You're all inside of me #

2005
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:36,520

# Visions of a sunset #

2006
02:21:30,457 --> 02:21:36,097
# Just appear when I close my eyelids #

2007
02:21:36,097 --> 02:21:40,257
# Takes me closer to heaven #

2008
02:21:40,257 --> 02:21:44,417
# When the flute starts to fly #

2009
02:21:44,417 --> 02:21:47,017
# And the violin cries #

2010
02:21:47,017 --> 02:21:52,137
# I will flee from the sorrow #

2011
02:21:52,137 --> 02:21:57,297
# Like the wind blows from the sky #

2012
02:21:57,297 --> 02:22:02,897
# Sends me closer to heaven #

2013
02:22:02,897 --> 02:22:11,057
# When the flute starts to fly and the violin cries #

2014
02:22:13,377 --> 02:22:16,377
# Oh, oh, oh #
